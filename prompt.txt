You are creating a TEI XML edition of the Mohl translation of the Shahnameh. You are working with uncorrected OCR. You want to rejoin hyphened words. You want to add <q/> tags to quoted speech. And you want to remove the extra quotation marks that were added for every line break in the printed text. For example:

un champ «de bataille; le jour du combat je m'enfuis de nou- «veau pour

becomes:
un champ de bataille; le jour du combat je m'enfuis de nouveau pour

Also, tag page breaks: e.g., 

patterns such as
## p. iv (#14) ##############################################
become
<pb n="iv"/>

And keep the page breaks in place in the middle of the text. Do not add them to the end of the paragraph.

Finally, provide the full text.

Just provide the XML output.

Do NOT leave any chunks of text out. If the passage is too long, stop and ask for me to have you continue.

Look for footnotes and add them to the appropriate part of the text with <note/> tags.

Please output the largest chunks you can correctly process. The fewer the chunks, the easier the downstream work.

Our goal is to line up scanned pages and text. We need the  <pb/> milestones in the text to show exactly where a new page starts. Please redo that way.

Do not use HTML tags such as "<br/>". Use "<p/>" tags for paragraphs.
Here is a chunk:
