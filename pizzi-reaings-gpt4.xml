176. May your name reach great heights."
177. He ordered the demon, like his mate,
178. To kiss on his shoulders.

182. He became distressed and sought a solution from every side.
183. Eventually, they cut both from his shoulders,
184. It's fitting if you remain amazed by this.
185. Like the branches of a tree, those two black snakes
186. Sprang up again from the king's shoulders.
187. Wise physicians gathered around,
188. Each one of them spun tales.
189. They crafted all kinds of deceits,

192. With sagacity, he went to Zahhak.
193. He said to him, "This was meant to be,
194. Stay put to see what becomes, no need to send away.
195. Make food and give them peace by eating,
196. There should be no other remedy but this.
197. Do not feed them anything but human brains,
198. Lest they die from this nourishment."
199. Look at the demon's son in this quest,
200. What he sought and what he saw in this conversation.
201. Perhaps so that he might devise a hidden solution,
202. Lest he remain indebted to the people of the world.

        1. When the ill-fated one left the city of Kabul,

        4. Where they spoke of that assembly,
        5. Throughout, the entire plain was a hunting ground,
        6. All were digging wells beneath the path,
        7. Burying weapons deep into the ground,
        8. The very swords, lances, and vengeful blades,
        9. Ingeniously, they blinded the mouth of the well,

        11. As Rustam, with haste, set out on his journey,
        12. Casting off his mount, hastening forward,
        13. "He comes, the unarmed, without his army,
        14. Come forth and from that act, seek forgiveness,
        15. The commander of Kabul emerged from the city,
        16. With a tongue full of excuses, venom in his flow,
        17. When his eyes met with the face of Tehmten,
        18. He dismounted his horse to see him,
        19. From the top of an Indian saddle, he took hold,
        20. Stripped bare, and took his stand, hand on head,

        27. It is fitting if you forgive my sin,
        28. And renew my customs and ways,
        29. He went forth before him, barefoot,
        30. A head full of dust, a heart full of schemes,
        31. Rustam forgave his wrongdoing,
        32. And increased his standing from that point,
        33. He ordered to cover his head and feet,
        34. Mounted the saddle and departed from the place,
        35. Over the city of Kabul, there was a place,
        36. From the greenery of its land, heart-pleasing it was,
        37. Within it, water and several trees,
        38. In joy, they placed every garment,

        41. Wine was brought, and musicians were called,
        42. Nobles were seated on majestic thrones,
        43. Afterward, the king thus spoke to Rustam,
        44. "When your standard arrives at the hunting ground,
        45. I have a place, over plain and hill,
        46. Where in every spot, groups have hunted game,
        47. The entire plain is filled with game, deer, and onager,
        48. For one who is a masterful hunter,
        49. In his grasp, onager and deer will come in the field,
        50. From that joyous field, one should not pass by.
