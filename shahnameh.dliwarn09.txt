THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSL
Done into English by
ARTHUR GEORGE WARNER, M.A.
AND
EDMOND WARNER, L.A.

The year A.D, 1010 saw the completion of the Shahndma, the great
Persian epic. Its author, the poet Wirdausi, spent over thirty labort-
ous years in its composition, only to expericnee, when the task had
been achieved, a heart-breaking disappointment well worthy of in-
clusion in any record of the calamities of authors. His work has
survived the test of time, and by general consent is accounted to be
one of the few great epics of the world. Geographically, and in some
other respects, it may be said to stand half-way hetween the epies of

urope and those of India. In its own land it has no peer, while in
‘construction and subject-matter it is unique. Other epics centre
round some heroic character or incident to which all else is subser-
vient. In the Shéhndma there is no lack cither of heroes or of un-
cidents, but its real hero is the ancient Persian people, and its theme
their whole surviving legendary history from the days ot the First
Man to the death of the last Sdsanian Shah in the middle of the seventh
century of ourera. Itis the glory of the Persian race that they ulone
among all nations possess such a record, based as it is on their own
traditions and set forth in the words of their greatest poet. In another
sense, too, the Shahnama is unique. The authors ot the other great
epics tell us little or nothing of their own personalities or of their
sources of information. Their works are fairy palaces suspended in
mid air; Wwe see the result, bul know not how it, was achieved. The
author of the Shdélndinga takes us into his eontklence from the first, so
that in reading it we are let into the seeret of epie-malung, and cau
apply the knowledge thus gamed to solve the problem of the con:
struction of its great vongeners. To the student. of COTIPOPALEVG
mythology and, foll-lore, to the lover of historic romance or romantic
history, and to all that are fond of tales of high achievenients and the
gests of herocs, the Shahndma is a storehouse of rich and abundant
material. To set forth a complete presentment of it with the needful
notes and elucidations is the object of the present translation, made
from two of the best printed texts of the original— that of Vullers aud
Landauer, and that of Turner Mavan.

KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHIRWD

HE REIGNED SEVEN MONTHS

ARGUMENT

Kubdd on his accession sends two chiefs to accuse of iis-
government the fallen and imprisoned Shah, Khusrau Parwiz,
who justifies himself at great length. His fall is made the
subject of a lament by Barbad, the minstrel, who afterwards
mutilates himself. The chiefs, noticing symptoms of remorse
in Kubad, insist upon the death of Khusrau Parwiz who is
killed with all his other suns. Kubdéd falls in love with,
and wishes to marry, Shfrin, who poisons herself rather than
consent, and Kubdd himself is poisoned soon afterwards.

NOTE

The days of the reign of Kubéd (Kobad IL, Feb.-Sept.,
A.D. 628) were few and evil. Tradition already had prepared
the ground for this in the untavourable account given of
his early years... The murder of his father was followed by
that of all his brothers, aud by the tragic death of Shirin,
while in addition to all these horrors a frightful pestilence
broke out in his reign and the great mortality that ensued
still further weakened the resources of an already almost
exhausted country and helped to pave the way for the suc-
cessful Arab invasion of a few years later on, Kubéd is
represented in the poem as a loutish, uneducated youth,?
but even if bis abilities had been great it is difficult to see
how he could have extricated himself from the coil in which

Sy Smaak sy of om ~ rm het meme oe -

} "THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

he found himself involved without mishap to himself or
others. He owed his release from prison and perhaps his
life to the very conspirators that subsequently demanded
of him for their own security the death of his father. To
have refused would have been fatal to himself, while in all
probability his father and his brothers, with the exception
of one who would have been made Shah, would have perished
all the same. It is inconceivable that the conspirators would
have run the risk to themselves of restoring Khusrau Parwiz,
with his black record of ingratitude as instanced by his treat-
ment of Bandwi and Gustaham,! to his former position as
ruler. With the exception of his infatuation for Shirin, which
hardly can be regarded as historical, Kubad throughout his
short reign was the victim of circumstances.

§§ land 2. Kharrdd, son of Barzin, was one of the most
trusted ministers of Khusrau Parwiz and planned the assassina-
tion of Bahram Chibina.2 According to Tabari he fell at
the battle of Dhu Kar.?

As the epoch of the Sésdnian Dynasty draws to an end
through scenes of deepening tragedy the legitimist leanings
of the tradition seem to become more and more pronounced
and we have an instance here. It is hardly to be supposed,
historically speaking, that formal charges of misgovernment
were drawn up against, and as formally answered by, Khusrau
Parwiz, but rather that someone, desirous of vindicating
that Shih’s memory and conversant with the circumstances
of the time, soon after his death drew up the charges and the
replies thereto. Versions of them are given in both the
Arabic and Persian Tabart and elsewhere. Four of the
charges are found in both the Tabarfs as well as in the Shah-
néima.4 They are :—

1. The murder by Khusrau Parwiz of his father Hurmuzd.

2. The illegitimate accumulation of treasure as a result
of the financial oppression of the people.

3. The harsh treatment of the royal princes.

4. The refusal to restore the True Cross.

To these the Arabic Tabari adds :—

1. The general ill-treatment of all prisoners.

9. Enforced recruiting for the royal Haram even of
women already marricd.

3. The keeping of the troops for a long period absent
from home.
The Persian Tabarf adds :—

1. The imprisonment of the troops defeated by the Arabs

at Dha Kar and by Heraclius.

2. The exactions of arrears of tribute for the previous

twenty or thirty years.

The attempt to slay the youthful Yazdagird (alter-
wards the last Sasd4nian Shah).

The deposition of Nu’man, prince of Hira.?

The mutilation and subsequent cxecution of Mardan-
shah.?

In the Arabic Tabari eight charges are made against
Khusrau Parwiz two of which—those relating to the royal
Haram and the refusal to restore the “‘ True Cross ’’—are
loft unanswered.

In the Persian Tabari eleven charges are formulated to
each of which in the same order an answer is made. Some
of the charges, however, must be regarded as later additions
while that relating to Nu’man is not likely to have suggested
itself to a Persian and must come from an Arab source. In
the Shahnama there are eight charges, all of which are more
or less answered, but not in the same order as they are pre-
ferred, but in the following :—], 6, 7, 8, 2, 5, 3, 4. Thus
Khusrau Parwiz replies to the most serious accusations—
those of offences against persons—first. The Shdhndima
agrees most closely with the Arabic Tabarf, supplies the missing
answer with regard to the “ True Cross,” but does not deal
with the yravamen of the royal Haram question, as that par-
ticular charge is not one of those mentioned in the poem.

Galinish subsequently served in the war against the Arabs,
fought at the Battle of the Bridge, and was perhaps slain at
Kadisiya.?

§5. Indignant legitimate tradition is naturally very
wroth with Mihr Hurmuzd, the murderer of Khusrau Parwiz,
whom it describes as the lowest of the low and vilest of the
vile. According to Tabari, however, Mihr Hurmuzd was the
son of Marddnshah, the governor of Nimriz and one of the
most obedient and faithful of Khusrau Parwiz’ officials. In
the Persian Tabari’s version of the Romance of Bahrém

6 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

Shibina that hero’s brother, Yalanu-sina in the Shahndma, is
called Marddnshéh. Yaldn-sina is always represented as
being one of Bahram Chubina‘s most loval adherents just as
the other brother, Gurdwi, was a firm supporter of Khusrau
Parwiz, while their sister Gurdya held an intermediate position,
faithful to Bahram Chibina, but opposing his kingly ambition
in every way in her power. Later on when married to Gus-
taham, the maternal uncle of Khusrau Parwiz, she agreed,
on condition that she should become the Shah’s wife and that
a full amnesty should be given to all her adherents, to murder
hes husband and did so. There would be nothing strange
therefore in Mardanshah, if identical with Yalan-sina, becoming
reconciled to, and receiving high office from, Khusrau Parwiz.
He would serve one master as faithfully as he served the other.
In the circumstances the strange thing would have been tor
the treacherous Shéh not to have taken the first convenient
occasion against him. According to the story the Shah,
two years before his deposition, consulted the astrologers
who informed him that his death would come from Nimrtz,
He therefore began to suspect and summoned Mardanshah,
but finding no pretext for putting him to death, as he was
perfectly loyal and witha] an aged man, determined merely
to cut off his right hand and make him a large present of money .
as compensation. The sentence was carried out. Mardan-
shéh regarded such a mutilation as worse than death and,
when shortly afterwards the Shadh was good enough to send
and express his regret for what had occurred, asked the
Sh4h to grant hima boon. The Shah swore to do so, on which
Mardanshth requested that his head should be struck off
in order to wipe out the disgrace put upon him. The Shah,
bound by his oath, felt himself obliged to consent and the
execution took place accordingly. The Shah wished to make
Mardénshah’s son governor of Nimriz, but he refused and
withdrew from the army.1 He joined the conspiracy against
Khusrau Parwiz? and by avenging his father on the Shah
justified the prediction of the astrologers.

The account given by Theophanes of the last days of the
Shah is different. As a general rule it is not prudent to put
iaith in stories of what occurred in Oriental palaces or prisons,
hut owing to the special circumstances of the case lis in-
formation may he good in this instance, as it appears to be

 

 

ANT, p. 379. ZT, ii., 330. * See Vol, viil., p, 196.
KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHiRWI) 7

based on letters written by Heraclius. After the capture of
Khusrau Parwiz by the conspirators, he was bound and
confined in the ‘‘ House of Darkness,’”? which he had himself
built as a stronghold for his treasures. Here he was sparingly
fed on bread and water for, said Shirwi: ‘* Let him eat the
gold that he has vainly amassed, and for whose sake he has
starved many, and made the world itself a desert.” Shirwi
also sent satraps to revile and spit upon him, had his son
Mardasas, whom he had wished to crown, slain before his eyes,
and all his other sons as well, sent his enemies to beat and
spit upon him, and, after five days of such treatment, had him
put to death with arrows. Shirwi then wrote to Heraclius
to announce the death of the detested Khusrau Parwiz,
arranged terms of peace, released all the captives, and restored
the “ True Cross.”! With regard to these latter statements
of Theophanes it should be observed that peace was not
concluded, and the *‘ True Cross” restored, till after the death
of Shirwi.?

According to Tahari Kubdéd had Mihr Hurmuzd put to
death.®

§6. The association of Khusrau Parwiz and Shirin began,
it would seem,* before his accession to the throne, and he
reigned for thirty-eight years. If Shirwi really wished to
marry Shirin it must have been for political motives and
because she had been s> much in his father’s confidence and
might furnish useful information. For a son to marry his
father’s wives was, according to Persian ideas, quite the correct
procedure in the circumstances.

Kub4d is said to have been bitterly reproached by his
two sisters, Pirdndukht and Azarmdukht, for his share in
the deaths of his father and brothers, and to have suffered
much from sickness and remorse. He died at Dastaygird,
but from what cause is uncertain. The plague was very
virulent at the time. Poison was often made to account
for what was really due to disease.

How Shirwi ascended the Throne, announced his Wil]

3

and sent Chiefs to his Father with Counsel and
Hucuses

Now when Shirwi sat on the goodly throne,

And donned the royal crown so much desired,

The leaders of the Iranians each drew near

To proffer him the homage due to kings,

Exclaiming : “ Worshipful and honoured Shah !

Know, God gave thee the crown, and now thou sittest

Securely on the throne of ivory,

And may thy sons and scions have the world.”
Kubdad replied: “‘ Be ever conquering

And happy. Never will we practise ill.

How good is justice with benevolence !

The world will we keep peaceful and cut off

The works of Ahriman by every right,

Ancestral precedent that greatencth

The Glory of our Faith. I will dispatch

A message to my sire and tell him all.

He is in evil odour in the world

Through his ill deeds: let him excuse his faults

To God and turn to custom and the way.

If he shall heed me he will not resent

My conduct. Then will [ devote myself

To state-affairs and strive to compass justice

Both publicly and privily, do good *

Where good is due, and break no poor man’s heart.

[ need two honest men of goodly speech,

Whose memories are charged with ancient lore.”
_ @
KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHiRWI) y

He asked the assembly: ‘‘ Whom shall I employ ?
Who is most shrewd and honest in Iran?”

The warriors all suggested by their looks
Two men of lore if they should give consent.
Kubad perceived whom the Iraénians
Agreed to choose: one of them was Ashtad,
The other was Kharrad, son of Barzin,
The old—two sages eloquent and heedful.
Kubad addressed them thus: ‘‘O ye wise men,
Ye chiefs experienced and veteran !
Deem not the conduct of the world too toilsome,
Because the Great by travail compass treasure.
It is for you now lo approach the Shdh ;
Perchance through you he may conform himself.
Appeal to him by instance new or old
As there is need.”
With tears unwillingly
Those sages made them ready. When Kharrad,
son of Barzin, and when Ashtaéd, who had
Gashasp for sire, had mounted on their steeds,
As bidden, Kubad said: ‘* Now with right good will
‘Tis yours to take the road to Taisaftn,+
To carry to my glorious sire a message,
And bear it all in mind from first ‘to last.
Say: ‘T'was no fault of ours nor did the frAnians
Cause. this, but having left the way of Faith
Thou hast thyself incurred God’s chastisement,
For, first, no son legitimate will shed
His sire’s blood though impure or give assent
Thereto and fill the hearts of upright folk
With pain. Again, thy treasures fill the world,
And thine exactions reach all provinces,
While, thirdly, many horsemen brave and famed
Within Iran who gladdened there have left
Son, country, and their own pure kith and kin,

Have parted, this to Chin and that to Rim,
And now are scattered o’er each march and land.
Again, when Cesar, who had done and borne
So much for thec, had given thee a host
And daughter too with treasure and much else,
Desired of thee the Cross of Christ for Rum,
So that his land might be revived thereby,
How did the Cross of Jesus profit so
Thy treasures when complaisance on thy part
Would have made Cesar glad ? But thou didst not
Restore it, hadst not wit enough for that,
Or one to guide thee to humanity.
Again, thy greed was such that wisdom’s eye
Was all obscured in thee, and thou didst seize
The chattels of the poor whose curses brought
Ill on thy head. Thou slewest thy mother’s brothers,!
Two loyal men who gave thy throne a lustre.
Moreover thou hadst sixteen sons whose days
And nights were passed in prison while no chief
Could sleep secure from thee but hid in fear.?
Know, that which hath befall’n thee is from Gad ;
Reflect on thy foul deeds. As for myself,
I am but as the instrument in all
This wrong, am but the heading of the tale.
By God, ‘twas not my fault, no aim of mine
To wreck the Shab’s throne! Now for all seek grace,
And say so to these chieftains of Iran ;
Turn from ill deeds to God—the Guide to good—
Who may abate the wocs that thou hast brought
Upon thyself.’ ”

On hearing this the twain
Departed with their hearts all seared and sore
Till, sorrowful and weeping, they arrived
At Taisafin and in that city sought

KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SAIRIVi) rr

The palace of Martisipand for there
The exalted king resided. Galfntish -
Sat at the palace-gate: thou wouldst have said : —
‘‘ Karth is convulsed before him!’ He was armed
In helm and breastplate, all the Arab steeds
Wore bards, and all his soldiers were drawn up,
Equipped, and sword in hand. He grasped a mace
Of steel, his heart all fire and storm. Now when
Kharrad, son of Barzin, and when Ashtad,
Son of Gashasp, those sages twain, dismounted,
He rose forthwith, rejoiced to look on them,
And gave them place befitting, hailing them
As famous chiefs. The eloquent Kharrad
First laved his tongue in valour and then said
To Galintish: “ Kubad the glorious |
Hath donned in peace the Kaian crown. Iran,
Tian and Rum have tidings that Shirwi}
Is seated on the throne of king of kings.
Why this cuirass and helm and massive mace ?
Who is thine enemy ?”
Said Galintish :--

*O veteran! may all thy doings prosper.
Thou art concerned about my tender frame C. 2024
Because I am in iron garniture.
I bless thee for thy kindness ; thou deservest
That I shall sprinkle jewels over thee.
Thy words are naught but good, and may the sun
Be thine associate in the world. Declare
Why thou hast come, then look for my reply.”

He thus gave answer: “ Glorious Kubdd
Commissioned me to bear Khusrau Parwiz
A message and if now thou wilt ask audience?
I will deliver what the world-lord said—

*That being the name by which he had been generally known,
his real name (Kubad) having been kept secret. See Vol. viil.,
PP. 375, 416, .

* Reading with P.
¢
12 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUST

That monarch of the flock.”
Said Galfntish :---
‘* Who ean reniember words so well as thou,
O worshipful ? Yet nathless Shah Kubad
Gave me full many a counsel touching this,
And charged me, saying: ° Let none have by day
Or night an audience of Khusrau Parwiz
Unless thou hearest what the messenger
Hath got to say in Persian new or old.’ ”

Ashtad said: “I hold not my message secret,
O fortunate! It is: * The sword is fruiting,
And nuzzling princes’ heads.’ In this regard
Now ask for audienee of Khusrau Parwiz
That we may tell the message of the Shah.”

This hearing Galintish arose, made fast
His mail, went to the Shah with folded arms,

As servants should, and said thus: “ Live for ever,
O Shah! May evil never vex thy heart.
There cometh by Ashtad and by Kharrdd,
Son of Barzin, a message from the Shah
From court.”
Khusrau Parwiz laughed out and said :-—

“* Speak wiser words for if he be the king
Then what am I, and why am I within
This narrow prison, and why necd’st thou ask
That I shall grant an audience unto any,
Be their words false or true ?”

So Galintsh
Returned to those two warriors, reported
The answer of the paladin, and said :—-.
‘*“ Now go with folded arms, declare your message,
And hearken his reply.”

Those sages twain

Of honest speech inswathed their visages
In sashes brought from Chin and, when they saw
The Shah, did reverence and waited long

What while he sat upon a lofty throne
Adorned with effigies of sheep and wolves,
Impleached with gold and gems, with under him
A couch of yellow broider y: He leaned
On cushions hued like lapis-lazuli,
Held a fine quince and drowsed there all amort.
When he beheld those chiefs supreme in wisdom C. 2030
He roused himself and secretly invoked
God’s help. He laid that fine quince on the cushions
That he might welcome those two wayfarers.!
The quince ee from the cushions, rolled unbruised
Upon the couch and thenee from throne to floor.
Ashtad ran, took it up, wiped off the dust,
And laid the quince upon his head. The world-lord
Turned from Ashtad that he might neither sce
Nor seent the quince. They sct it on the throne,
And stood themselves. The matter of the quince?
Perturbed Khusrau Parwiz who boded ill,
Looked up to heaven, and said: ‘“ O truthful Judge!
Who can establish one whom Thou o’erthrowest,
Who join what Thou hast broken? When bright
fortune

Departeth from a race it bringeth sorrow
Because the day of joy is passed away.”

Then to Ashtad: “ Now for thine ambassage
From mine unnatural child of ill repute,
And from that handful of conspirators,
My hateful and black-hearted enemies.
Malignant fools are they and in their folly
Most wretched. Fortune will desert our race ;
None will rejoice again; the crown and throne
Will pass to those unfit; this royal Tree
Will be destroyed; the Base will be exalted ;
The spirits of the Great grow sorrowful.

L4 *THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSEI

The majesty will bide not with our sons,

Or with our kindred or posterity ;

Their friends all be their chiefest eneimies,
Revilers and destroyers of the race.

This quince hath made the secret evident ;

The throne of king of kings will bear no fruit.
Now tell to me the words that thou hast heard :
I count his less than water in the stream.”

Then those two men released their tongues to speak,
And told all that Kubad, his son, had said, |
Not keeping e’en a whisper back from him.

The king of kings, when he had heard the message, |
Writhed with distress and heaved a deep, cold sigh.
Then said he to those chiefs : “* Hear my response,
And bear it to the young prince, every word.

Say: ‘ Quit thine own misdecds ere blaming others’.
What thou hast uttered are they words of thine ?
A murrain on the prompter !4 Speak not so

As to rejoice thy foe with thy fool’s talk,

And let him learn that thou hast not the wisdom
To furnish specch with knowledge from thy brains.
If thy trust is in words that profit not

Thou mak’st default in soul and wisdom too.

He that shall call thee wicked, then acknowledge
Thee to be world-lord, should not sit before thee.
And order matters whether great or small.

Think not in future of such messages

Or thou wilt cause thy foemen to rejoice.

My state hath been appointed me by God ;

My hopes are set upon the other world,

And thou by these thy charges which are lies

Wilt gain no glory in the nobles’ eyes.’ ”

How Khusrau Parwtz answered Shirw¢t

‘“ Now will I make full answer that thou mayst

Repeat my words in public. They will serve

As my memorial when I am gone—

A truthful statement of my case—and thou

Wilt know, when I reveal my gricf and travail,

That all my treasures were derived from toil.

Thou speakest in the first place of Hurmuzd,

His anger with me, and those bygone days:

My father’s wrath against us was arousccl

By slanderer’s words and thus confusion came.

When I had learned what occupied his thoughts

I left fran by night, avoiding roads.

He sought my death by poison; I perecived

No antidote but flight and so I fled,

And was not taken in the net of bale.

I heard that ill had come upon the Shah,

And quitted Barda’ when the news arrived.

That knave Bahram Chubina with his troops

Opposed us on the battlefield. I fled

From him too on the day of fight that I

Might fall not in his clutches. Afterwards

I came a second time and bravely fought,

My troublous fortune passed away and all
elhe realm that I had lost returned to me.

My contest with him was no brief affair ;

The whole world were spectators of the strife.

By the command of God who multiplicth

His benefits on us, and is the Guide

In good and ill, Irdn and Turkistan!

16 ® THE SHALHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

Submitted and Bahram Chitbina’s plans

Were foiled. Released from war with him I hasted,
First, to take vengeance for my father’s death.
Bandwi and Gustaham, my mother’s brothers,
Men that had not a peer in any land,

Had risked their lives for me and were all mine
In love as well as kinship, but there were

My father’s death and mine own gricf thereat ;
I was not sluggish to avenge his blood.

I lopped Bandwi both hand and foot for he
Ilad made the Shah's place dark, while Gustaham,
Who disappeared and sought some distant nook,
Was slain all unawares by my command :

Those murderers’ lives and aims all came to naught.
Next, as to what thou said’st of thine own case,
Of thine own strait confinement and affairs :

It was to keep my sons from evil deeds

That would recoil upon themselves. Ye were
Not straitly bound in prison, not misprized,
And had no harm to fear. I did not then
Treat you with scorn but held my treasury

At your disposal, acting as the Shahs

Had done before, not idly or without

A precedent. Chase, minstrelsy, and polo—

All that befitteth chiefs—were yours at will,
With hawks and chectahs, jewels and dinars.
Your so called prison was a palace where

Ye lived in joy. I dreaded thee moreover
Through what the readers of the stars had said.
That was the cause of thine imprisonment

That thou mightst do us naught of injury—
The very injury that thou art doing.

I never parted with thy horoscope

Till I had sealed and given it to Shifrin.

When I had reigned for six and thirty years,
And thou past doubt amidst such pleasant days
KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SUIRWI) 17

yav’st all the matter to the wind, although

Much time had passed o’er us, there came to thee
A letter out of Hindustan but not

Without my cognizance. The chief of Rajas

Sent us a letter, jewels, divers stuffs,

An Indian scimitar, white elephant,

And all that I could hope for in the world,

And with the scimitar was gold brocade

With all varieties of gems uncut.

To thee the letter was on painted silk ;

So when I saw the Indian script I called

An Indian seribe, a fluent, heedful speaker,

Who when he read the Indian Raja’s words

Wept for the letter ran: * Live joyfully

For thou art worthy both of joy and realm,

And on the day of Dai in month Azar C. 2033
Thou wilt be king and rulJer of the world.

Thy sire will reign for eight and thirty years,

For so the stars ordain. Good times will shine
Upon thee; thou wilt don the crown of greatness.’
These words have been fulfilled to me to-day,

But we should wash not from our hearts affection.
I was aware that fortune had decreed

That when thy throne had gained its brilliancy
Mine only portion would be toil and pain,

And that my bright day would be turned to gloom ;
But as I gave, had Faith, made friends, and loved
I did not lour by reason of that letter.

I gave it, having read it, to Shirin,

And pondered much upon it. In her keeping

Are both the letter and the horoscope,

And no one great or small is ware thercof.

If thou wouldst see it make request of her ;

Thou haply mayst regard it more or less.

I wot that seeing it thou wilt repent,

And seek to heal the past. For what thou said’st

18 "THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

Of bonds and of imprisonments, and how

We have done others hurt, ’tis this world’s way,
And that of former chiefs and kings of kings,

And if thou know’st it not speak with an archmage ;
He will enlighten thee thereon and tell thee :-—

‘°Tis Ul to keep God’s enemy alive.’

Those that were in our prison were mere divs
Complained of by the righteous. Neither bloodshed
Nor utter harshness ever was our trade.

I shut up criminals and did not hold

Of small account wrongs done by them to others ;
But now I hear that thou hast freed these men—
Men worse than dragons—and for this thou art

A sinner guilty both in word and deed

In God’s sight. Now that thou art lord be prudent,
And if thou know’st not how consult the wise.
Forgive not those that vex thee though thou hopest
For wealth through them, and what can better bonds
For one in whom thou seest naught but harm ?

In talking of my wealth thou hast not shown

Good sense and wisdom. We have never asked

For more than toll and tax. When these were paid
Tf any were still rich, though men might say

That they were foes and miusereants of the seed

Of Ahriman, we thought of God and passed

Such matters lightly by. From Him I had

The crown and throne, and they have cost me dear.
The Maker of the world, the rightcous Judge,

Hath willed this change of fortune. In the world
His will is paramount, so when He would

Our minishment we seck not for addition.

We sought to please our Judge, but by our toils
Ifave not evaded [is apportionment,

Aud when He askcth me I will tell all.

That Questioner is wiser than thou art,

And one more potent in all good and ill.
KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHIRWi) 19

The miscreants that stand before thee now
Are not thy friends or kin, and what they say
Of me that also will they say of thee
Before thy focs. They are but slaves of gold
And silver: thou wilt find in them no helper.
They have possessed thy heart and there instilled
Each fault of mine. Such words as these are not
In thy philosophy and will not profit
Those miscreants’ minds, but I have uttered them
For my foes’ sake that they who read this Ictter,
Writ in the ancient tongue, may know that lics
Lack lustre even from the mouths of Shahs.
“will be too a memorial in the world,
A consolation to the man of wisdom,
And after our decease whoe’er shall read
These words of ours will learn our policy.
I gathered armics from Bartés and Chin,
And everywhere appointed generals,
Then made attacks upon mine enemies
Till none dared raise his head. When they were
scattered
Our treasuries were all filled. The whole land toiled
For us, and from the sea so many gems
Were brought us that the shipmen grew aweary. — -
Plain, sea, and mountain, all were mine. Now when
The treasury of drachms had been expended
The coffers were refilled with new dinars,
With precious stones and royal jewelry,
As well as clothes and implements of war,
And when our crown was twenty-six years old
Our treasuries were rich with many gems.
I struck a new die for my drachms and turned
To joy and merriment. That year when I
Had ta’en account I found the total sum
Ten million of dindrs. Paiddwasis,1

In Persian reckoning, I spent and squandered.
Each purse contained twelve thousand in dinars,
And those thus spent were royal, while besides
The tribute and dinars from Hindustan,
The realm of Rum and land of sorcerers ;
Besides from every province gifts and tribute
From all the sovereigns and potentates ;
Besides New Year and Autumn offerings,
The gifts of horses and of fair-faced slaves ;
Besides cuirasses, helmets, axes, swords,
Which every one sent to us liberally ;
Besides musk, camphor, sables, heaver-skins,
Red weasels’ and white wolves’, our subjects all
Set suchlike loads upon their beasts and sought
Our court in haste; none was recalcitrant.
Abundant toil of all sorts have we spent
To amass a treasure—one additional
To those known as Khuzrd and as ’Arus,?
Reserved by me against an evil day.
We long discussed what name the hoard should have,
And in the end we called it Bad Awar.?
Thus in my six and twentieth year of reign
Heaven till the eight and thirticth favoured me ;
My chieftains were all safe, my foes all quaked,
And now I hear that thou art sovereign—
An evil juncture this for all the world,
Which reft of pleasure must perforce be mute.
Thou wilt make carth calamitous, fulfilled
With suffering and profitless, Moreover,
Those same injurious persons that surround thee,
And are the Light® of thy dark nights, will give
Thy throne up to the wind that thou mayst not
Enjoy the world. Were there with thee a sage,
So that thy darkened mind might be illumed,
Thou wouldst not do amiss in giving gifts

So that thy wealth might reach the poor. My son,
Whose days are few, whose wisdom is but secant !
Solicitude will rob thy soul of joy.

This know, that these our treasures are thy stay ;
The opportunity is in thy grasp.

They are the appanage of royalty ;

A world that is all moneyless is lost.

A pauper Shah will be unjust, and he

Whose hand is empty hath no strength or worth.
Without the means of largess he by all

Will be declared a fraud and not a Shah.
Moreover, if thy riches reach thy foes,

And all the idols come to Brahmans’ hands,

The worshippers will turn from God, thy name
And fame be spurned. If thou art treasureless
Thou wilt not have an army, and thy subjects
Will hail thee not as Shah. The dog is good

At begging bread, but if thou fillest him

He threateneth thy life. Again, thou said’st
About my strategy that I have stationed

The troops along the roads, and blamest me
Through ignorance, not knowing gain from loss.
The answer is that by my toil I gathered C. 2036
My splendid treasures, captured foreign cities,
And shattered all my foes that we might sit
Without vexation, toil, or injury

In peace upon the pleasant throne. I scattered
My horse about the frontier, and (to show

The difference ’twixt the worthless and the worthy)
When thou recall’st the troops from every side
The foe will see the road clear, for fran

Is like a garden in the jocund Spring,

Whose happy blossoms never fail to flower,

A garden of pomegranate and narcissus,

Of apples and of quince; but when the orchard
Becometh void of men the enemy
22 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUST

Will root up all the marjoram and snap
All branches of pomesranale ai nd of quince,
Tran’s walls are ils troops and gear of war,
Its thorns all arrows on Its batliements,
And if in wantoaness thou flingest down
The garden-wall the garden is as waste,
As sea or upland. Cast not down its wall
Or thou wilt break the Irdénians’ hearts and backs,
For then will raid and ravage, horsemen’s shouts,
And all the incidents of war ensue.
Iixpose not thou our children, wives, and land
To trouble: let but one such year clapse,
And sages will describe thee as a fool.
Now I have heard that thou dost give high place
To men unworthy. Know that Nushirwan,
Son of Kubad,! recorded in his Letter
Of Counsel that whoe’er doth give his arms
To foes doth give himself to slaughtering,
Since, when he asketh back those arms for use,
The enemy will fight.* As for the message
Of Cesar, which hath made thee call me Neat tless,
And self-willed. thou reeallest not the facts :
Thy words were prompted by some counsellor,
As for my tyranny and his: good faith,
Canst thou discern good faith from yee
Receive mine answer, thou of little wit !
But Iet me say withal, as is but right,
Thou art the plaintiff and the witness too-—
A thing no man of wisdom would allow.
When C zsar washed off from his face the dust
Of bale he chose me as his son-in-law
For valour’s sake. Whoever walketh not
The earth for ill, and hath some share of wisdom
Within him, knowcth that Bahram Chibina
Began the feud and that the franians

KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHIRW1J) 23

Took sides with him. The Rimans did not triumph
O’er him; the drifting sand can not bind fast

The mountain! But in that fight God vouchsafed
To aid me, and the armies of the world

Were naught to me. The [ranians have heard C. 2037
Of those events, and thou shouldst hear from them.
As for myself, I did whate’er I could,

Upon the day of fight, for Niyatus

With kindness and with magnanimity,

But have not reckoned that day’s recompense,

And Farrukhzad will tell thee just the same:

Look not upon the world with boyish eyes.

Gashasp, who was our treasurer, can tell,

And that good archimage, our minister,

That I bestowed upon the Ruman troops

A hundred thousand purses from our treasures.

I gave to Niyatus a thousand nuggets,

With earrings and red gold. Each nuggct’s weight
Was as a thousand treasury-miskals

I reckoned. I bestowed on him withal

Fine watered pearls that experts had found flawless,
And every one worth thirty thousand drachms

To jewellers, and five score noble steeds,

Selected from my stables—fifty saddled,

The others very choice, housed in brocade,

Mates for the wind upon the waste. I sent

All these to Cesar with my thanks withal.

For what thou said’st about the Cross of Christ,
That bit of old wood flung among my treasures.—

A matter of no loss or gain to me—

Thou hast been listening to some Christian’s talk.

I mused that one like Cesar, great and mighty,
Surrounded as he is by learnéd men—

Philosophers and potentates and priests—

Should call one that was executed God!

While as for this dry, rotten wood, if this
C. 2038

24 “THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

Mere uscless Cross were God “twould be Urmuzd,
Whose name we give to every month’s first day,
And would have vanished from our treasury
As Christ himself departed from the world.
Again for what thou said’st: ‘ Make thine excuse,
Amend thy conduct and ensue God’s path,
I answer: ‘ May the two hands of Kubdad,
Tis fect and lips and tongue rot! It was God
Who placed the crown upon my head: I took,
And revelled in the gift. I have returned it
Since He demanded it. What next I wonder ?
To Him will I confess, not to a boy
Scarce able to distinguish good and ill.’
All that God doth is welcome unto me
Though I have seen much woe and bitterness.
For eight and thirty years have I been Shah,
And none among the kings hath been my peer.
He that bestowed this world on me may give
Another but will have no thanks of mine!
I will pronounce a blessing on the realm :-—
* May earth be ever teeming with the wise.’
So long as God shall help and suecour us
None will dare curse.”

Then said he to Kharrad :—
‘““Q Memory of the great ones of the world!
Say to that foolish and impetuous boy :—
‘The lustre of our countenance is dimmed :
Farewell to thee for ever. Ags for me,
May all our converse be henceforth with sages.’
As for yourselves, illustrious messengers,
Ye Persians eloquent and eminent !
To both of you I also bid farewell.
Say nothing but the words that ye have heard.

So was it with Kats, that man of might,

Who took the world by skill and policy,

Who overturned the world, and where Jamasp,

Who shone in astrologie lore more brightly

Than Sol or Venus? Where is that famed Shah,
Bahram Gur, matchless in his strength and courage ?
No Shah was like him in munificence ;

The turning heaven dared not to touch his head.
Where is that Shah, my grandsire, bright of soul
Who ruled the world as KisrA Nushirwan ?

Where are the seven and forty world-lords ?4- Gone

In years ? They all have Iecft this spacious world,
Left palace, hall, and riding-ground. Midst Shahs,
Though some were older far, I had no peer.

I walked the world for good and ill, and held

The evil day aloof. ’Twas nune to traverse

Full many a ruggéd path and sweep away

Full many a foe. My treasures fill all lands ;

Where earth and water arc my toil is seen.

When with me too the world shall cease, and all
The nobles’ hopes grow dim, with my son also

The throne will not abide, for he will quit it,

And all his fortune end. What time the angel

Is foolish if he asketh its return.’
This is my message to the world, to mean
And mighty too: ere long the Shah and all
His famous troops will fall to slaughtering
Each other and fling fire on field and fell ;
Then sires will fall by sons and sons by sires :
Our enemies, the people that discoursed
Of evil deeds and chilling words, will pay
The smart when we are gone and not for long
Enjoy the world. Since rule and greatness end
With me what reck if Lion or another
Shall have the sway ?”’

Ashtad and brave Kharrad,
Son of Barzin, those sages, when they heard
The message of that leader, were heart-pierced,
And smote their heads. Both sorrowed for their

words ;

They buffeted their faces, rent their rohes eG, eels
In grief, and scattered dust upon their heads.
Those ancients fared forth from his presence, weeping,
In anguish, with their hearts all arrow-points.
With furrowed faces and in sore distress
They went before Shirwi and every whit
To that man brainless and incompctent
Detailed the message that the Shah had sent.

28 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUS!I

With foul words clamouring for his father’s blood,
And burning the youth’s heart, he left the throne

Of kingship, clasped with honoured hands his head,
And wept blood on his breast. News of that weeping
And of the lamentation of the king,

Came to the host and all were in dismay.

They met, discussed Khusrau Parwiz, and cried :—
‘ Tf he shall sit upon the throne again

He will disgrace the captains of the host.”

Whenas the sun rose o’er the darksomce hills

The maleontents awoke and went to court.

The Shah, on hearing of it, took his seat

Upon the throne, and those of high degree,

Akin or alien, approached the presence.

They took their seats with scowls but no one spoke.
The king said: ‘‘ Gibbeting is the desert

Of him that mourneth not my father’s woes.

I call such misbegotten and a knave.

Let none depend on such because that man

Is rottener than a rotten willow-tree.”’

He gat this answer from the men in fault :—
“Call whosoever saith: ‘I serve two Shahs’

A fool at heart and vile whate’er his rank.”

Shirwi rejoined: ‘‘ For Shahs no wealth no troops !
For one month we will utter pleasant words,

And give no hint of duress to my sire ;
He may make statements that will gladden us
Because his treasures are in every coast.”

On hearing this they rose to seek their homes.
Then Shah Shirwi gave orders to the cooks :—
‘Let nothing be denied Khusrau Parwiz :

Serve up ‘his food upon a golden service,
And let the food itself be rich and grateful.”

The servers brought it but he would not eat
The viands that were proffered, hot or cold.
Shirin’s hand brought to him all that he ate
KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHIRW?T) 29

Because she sorrowed with him in his gricf.

She was his sole good friend and soothed his woes
Both day and night, shared all his hopes and fears,
And quaked for him like willow in the wind.

A month passed and meanwhile Khusrau Parwiz
Was full of pain and anguish night and day,

His faults and crimes recalled to memory,

And little relish of that life had he.

§ 4

How Bdrbad lamented Khusrau Parwiz, cut off his own
Fingers, and burned his Instruments of Music

Now list the lamentation of Barbad,+

And grow forgetful of the world at large.

On hearing that the Shah, not by advice

And ’gainst his will, no longer filled the throne,
That ‘‘ men are secking how to murder him ;
The soldiers are renouncing fealty,”

Barbad came from Chahram to Taisaftin

With tearful eyes and heart o’ercharged ; he came
To that abode and saw the Shah whercat

His tulip-cheeks became like fenugreek.

He bode awhile in presence of the Shah,

Then went with wailing to the audience-hall.
His love flamed in his heart, his heart and soul
Burned in his anguish for Khusrau Parwiz ;

His eyes rained like a cloud in Spring and made
His bosom as the margent of the sea.

He fashioned him a dirge upon the harp,

And to that dirge he sang a mournful plaint.

For the story of Barbad see Vol. viii., p. 396 seq,

Where are Shabdiz, his stirrups and his sell

All golden and compacted gem to gem,

The golden litters and attendance rife,
Led steeds, white clephants, and dromedaries ?

That He thy foemen’s heads may headlong fling.
By God and by thy life, my king! I swear

By New Year’s Day, by sun, and jocund Spring,

“Tf e’er this hand of mine again shall turn
To harping may no blessing light on me;
Mine instruments of music will I burn
That I may ne’er behold thine enemy.”

He cut four fingers off and grasped the stumps
Within his other palm. Returning home

He kindled fire and burned his instruments,

While those about Kubad both day and night

At all that might befall thein quaked with fright.

How the Chiefs demanded from Shtrwi the Death oj
Khusrau Parwiz and how he was slain by Mihr
' Hurmuzd

Shirwi, a timid, inexperienced youth,

Found that the throne beneath him was a snare,
While readers of mankind saw that ’twas tinie
For men of might. Those that had done the ill,
And had produced that coil, went from the hall
Of audience to the presence of Kubad

To mind him of their infamous designs :—

‘We said before and now we say again

Thy thoughts are not on government alone.
There are two Shdhs now scated in one room,
One on the throne and one on its degree,
KUBAD (COMAIONLY CALLED SHIRWS 33

And when relations grow “twixt sire and son
They will behead the servants one and all,
It may not be, so speak of 1f no more.”
Shirwi was frightened and he played poltroon

Because in their hands he was as a slave.
He answered: “ None will bring him to the toils
Mixcept a man whose name is infamous.
Ye must go homeward and advise thereon.
Inquire: * What man is there that will abate
Our troubles seeretly ??”

The Shah’s? ill-wishers
Sought for a nuirderer to murder him
By stealth, but none possessed the pluck or courage
To shed the blood of sueh a king and hang
A mountain round his own neck. Everywhere
The Shah’s foes sought until they met with one
Blue-eyed, pale-checked, his body parched and bairy,
With lips of lapis-laznli, with feet
All dust, and belly ravenous; the head
Of that ill-doer was bare. None knew his naine
Midst high and low. This villain (may he never
See jocund Paradise !) sought Farrukhzad,
And undertook the deed. ‘“ This strife is mine,”
We said. “If ye will make it worth my while
This is my quarry.”’

“Go and do it then
“Tf thou art able,” Farrukhzad replied.
‘ Moreover open not aa! lips hercin.
I have a purse full of dinars for thee,
And I will look upon thee as my son.”
Ife gave the man a dagger keen and bright, C. tod

And then the murderer set forth in haste.
The miscreant, when he approached the Shah,
saw him upon the throne, a slave altending.
Khusrau Parwiz quaked when he saw that man,

And shed tears from his eyelids on his checks
Because his heart bare witness that the day
Of heaviness was near. THe cried: ‘‘ O wretch !
What is thy name? Thy mother needs must wail
thee.”’
The man replied: “‘ They call me Mihr Hurmuzd,
A stranger here with neither friend nor mate.”
Thus said Khusrau Parwiz: ‘‘ My time hath come,
Aud by the hand of an unworthy foe,
Whose face is not a inan’s, whose love none seeketh.”’
He bade a hoy attending him: ‘ Go fetch,
My little guide! an ewer, water, musk,
And ambergris, with cleaner, fairer robes.”
The boy-slave heard, unwitting what was ineant,
And so the little servant went away,
And brought a golden ewer to the Shah
As well as garments and a bow! of water,
Whereon Khusrau Parwiz made haste to go,
Gazed on the saercd twigs and muttered prayers :
it was no time for words or private talk.
The Shah put on the garments brought, he made
Beneath his breath confession of his faults,
And wrapped a new simarre about his head
In order not to see his murderer’s face.
Then Mihr Hurmuad, the dagger in his hand,
Made fast the door and coming quickly raised
The great king’s robe and pierced his liverstead.
Such is the process of this whirling world,
From thee its sceret keeping closely furled !
The blameless speaker and the boastful sce
That all its doings are but vanity,
For be thou wealthy or in evil case
This Wayside Inn is no abiding-place ;
Yet be offenceless and ensuc right ways
If thou desirest to receive just praise.

‘¢ Khusrau Parwiz was slaughtered this,” his fucs

Went to the palace-prison of the sad,

Where fiftecn of his noble sons were bound,

And slew them there, though innocent, what time

The fortune of the Shah was overthrown.

Shirwi, the world-lord, dared say naught and hid

His gricf though he wept sorcly at the news,

And afterwards sent twenty of his guards

To keep his brothers’ wives and children safe C. 2045

Now that the Shah had been thus done to death.
So passed that reign and mighty host away,

Its majesty, its manhood, and its sway

Such as no kings of kings possessed before,

Or heard of from the men renowned of yore.

It booteth nothing what the wise man saith

When once his head is in the dragon’s breath.

Call this world ‘ crocodile ” for it doth gnaw

The prey that it hath taken with its claw.

The work of Shah Khusrau Parwiz is done ;

His famous hoards and throne and host are gone.

To put one’s trust in this world is to be

In guest of dates upon a willow-trce.

Why err in such a fashion from the way

Alike by darksome night and shining day ?

Whate’er thy gains Iet them suffice thee still

As thou art fain to save thy soul from Hl,

And in thy day of strength hold thyself weak ;

Kor kindly impulses and justice seck,

And be intent on good. For what is thine

To give or spend do as thou dost incline ;

All else is pain and toil. TLow goodlier

Than we are friends whose faithfulness is clear !

Such faithfulness of friends is greatly dear.

§ 6

How Shtrwt asked Shirtn in Marriage, how Shirin
killed herself, and how Shirwi was slain

Since I have ended with Khusrau Parwiz
I speak next of Shirwi and of Shirin.

As soon as three and fifty days had passed
Since that whereon that glorious Shah was slain
Shirwi dispatched Shirin a messenger
To say: “‘ Thou wicked, potent sorceress,
Learned but in necromancy and black arts!

In all fran thou art the guiltiest.

By necromancy didst thou gain the Shah,

And by thy craft thou bringest down the moon.
Quake, guilty one! and come to me. Abide not
Thus in thy palace, joyful and secure.”

Shirin raged at his message and abuse
So foul and senseless. Thus she said: ‘“ God grant
That parricides possess not Grace or presence.

I will not see the wretch e’en from afar
At funeral or feast.”
That mournful dame
Sent for a scribe and had a document
Drawn in the olden tongue, structing him
Regarding her last wishes and estate.
She kept a little poison in a pyx;
She could not well procure it in the city.
She kept it on her, sewed a winding-shect
To wrap her form—that cypress of the garden----
And then returned this answer to Shirwi :-—
““ Kxalted Shah, the wearer of the crown !
Now perish all thy words and perish too
The villain’s heart and spirit that hath heard

KUBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHIRWTE) 37

Of witchcraft save by name and joyed therein.
Had Shah Khusrau Parwiz been one to cheer
His soul with sorcery there would have been
A sorceress within his bower, and she
Had seen his face.1 He kept me for his pleasure,
And when the dawn was peeping he was wont
To call me from the golden bower and joy
At sight of me. Shame on thee for such words!
Such knavish talk becometh not a king.
Remember God, the Giver of all good,
And utter not such words in others’ hearing.”
They brought the answer to the Shah. Shirwi
Raged ’gainst the guiltless dame? and said: ‘‘ Thou
needs
Must come. None is blood-thirstier than thou.
Come and behold my crown’s top. If it be
Magnifical then do it reverence.”
Shirin, on hearing this, was full of pain ;
She writhed; her checks grew wan. She thus
replied :—
“ I will not come to thee save in the presence
Of those wise men that are about thy court,
Men of experience and clerkly skill.”
Shirwi dispatched and summoned fifty men
Both wise and old, then sent one to Shirin,
To say: “ Arise and come. Knough of talk.”
Thereat she robed herself in blue and black,
And drew anear the Shah, approached apace
The Rosary of Revellers*—the spot
Wherein those fluent Persians were—and sat
Behind the great king’s curtain as became

The virtuous. He sent to her to say :—
“ Two months! of mourning for Khusrau Parwiz
Are o’er. Now be my wile that thou inayst take
Thy pleasure and avoid a mean estate.
I will maintain thee as my father did,
And e’en with more respect and tenderness.”
Shirin replied: ‘t Let me be righted first,
And then my life shall be at thy dispose.
I will not hesitate in answering
The hest and purpose of thy glorious heart.”
Shirwi agreed to that fair dame’s request,
Whereat the noble lady raised her voice
Behind the royal curtains, saying: “ O Shah!
Be happy and victorious. Thou said’st
That I was a bad woman and a witch,
Remote from purity and rectitude.”
Shirwi replied: “ T'was so, but generous folk
Do not take dudgeon at mere hastiness.”
Shirin addressed the other Persians present
Within the Rosary of Revellers,
And asked: ‘“‘ What have ye seen in me of ill,
Guile, folly, and dark ways? For many a year
I was the mistress of fran and helped
The Brave in everything. I ne’er ensued.
Aught but the right ; fraud and deceit I banned.
Through my word many were made governors,
And took their portions of the world full oft.
Who hath beheld my shadow in Iran
Away from home? If any one hath marked
My shadow, crown, and state let such declare
What he hath seen or heard and by his answer
Reveal the truth.” —
'., The magnates in attendance
Al spake her fair. ‘“‘ In all the world,” they said,

i She, hath no peer in public and. in private.’ a

Shirin proceeded thus: ‘‘ Ye lords and chicfs
Both veteran and redoubted ! three things make
The worth of women that bedeeck the throne
Of greatness : one is modesty and wealth
Wherewith her husband may adorn his house ;
The next is bearing blesséd sons, that she
May e’en excced her spouse in happiness ;

The third is having beauty and fine form,

Joined with the love of a sequestered life.

When I was mated to Khusrau Parwiz,

And entered on seclusion, he had come

Weak and dispirited from Rim to live

Within our land, but after reached such power

As none had heard of or had looked upon.

Moreover I have had four sons by him

To his great joy—Nastur, Shahrydar, Farid,

And Mardanshah, blue heaven’s coronal.

Jamshid and Faridiin had not such sons ;

May my tongue perish if I lie herein !

Their bodies all are now beneath the dust,

Their spirits roaming in pure Paraclise.”
Unveiling then her lovely countenance,

And musky hair, ‘‘ There is my face,” she added,

“ Such as itis. If there be falsehood show it.

My hair was all my hidden excellence,

For none on earth e’er used to look thereon.

What I display is all my sorcery,

Not necromancy, fraud, and evil bent.”

None had beheld her hair before, no chief C, 2048
Had heard thereof. The elders were astound,
And their mouths watered. When Shirwi beheld
The visage of Shirin his spirit flew
Unmarked away from him. Her face so dazed him
That love of her filled all his heart. He cried :-—
“YT want none but thyself. If I have thee
For wife fran can give me nothing more.
40 ° ru SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUST

I will not go from thy commands, but limn
My loyalty to thee upon mine eyes.”
The lady of the lovely face replied : —
‘T still need somewhat of the [rdnian king.
[ have two wants if thou wilt bid me speak,
And may thy king of kingship last for ever.”
Shirwi replied: ‘‘ My soul is thine, thy wish,
Whate’er it be, is granted.”
Said Shirin :-—
“ All treasures laid up by me in this land
Thou shalt assign me as mine own before
This noble company and write thyself
Upon this roll that thou renouncest all,
Both small and great.”
Shirwi made haste to do
Her bidding. Having gained her wish she quitted
The Rosary of Revellers, the chicfs
And noble Persians, went home, freed her slaves,
And made them happy with that wealth of hers
Whereof she gave a part to mendicants,
And to her family a larger share.
She gave too somewhat to the Fanes of Fire,
The feasts of New Year’s Day and Mihr and Sada,
To ruined homes and curavansarais
Then turned to lions’ Jairs. All this she gave
As offerings from Khusrau Parwiz, the world-lord,
And joyed his soul thereby. She sought the garden
And taking off her veil sat unadorned
Upon the ground and summoning her folk
Assigned with courtesy a place to cach,
Then cried thus loudly: ‘“‘ Hear, ye unaggrieved |.
For none will ever see my face again.
Fear ye the Judge of those that seek for justice,
The Lighter of the sun and moon and stars,
And speak but truth ; deceit is not for sages. |
Since first I came before. Khusrau Parwiz,
KUDBAD (COMMONLY CALLED SHIRWH) ax

Hirst made mine entry to his golden bower,
And was chief wife and Glory of the Shah,
Hath ay fanll at all appeared in me ?
There is no need to speak to save my face:
What booteth that to woman tn her need ?”
All rose to make reply: “* Famed dame of dames, © 2040
So eloquent and wise and bright of soul!
By God! none ever saw thee, ever heard
Thy voice behind the curtains. Verily
Thy like hath sat not on the goodly throne
Since Shah Hishang.”
Then all the servitors,
Slaves emulous and vigilant of heart,
Exclaimed: “* Exalted lady praised in Chin,
In Rim and in Taraz! who would presume
To speak aught ill of thee ? Could evil-doing
Bolit that face of thine ?”
Thus said Shirin :—
‘This reprobate, whom heaven above will curse,
Slew his own sire to compass crown and throne,
And may he never more see fortune’s face !
Hath he himself shut death out by a wall
Who lightly recked thus of a father’s blood ?
Ile sent a message to me that bedimmed
Mine own shrewd soul. I answered: ‘ While I live
My heart shall serve my Maker.’ I declared
My purpose fully, fearful of my foe :
He may defame me publicly when dead.
Ye are free agents and my slaves no longer.”
They wept much at her words and furthermore
Consumed with anguish for Khusrau Parwiz.
Informants went before the Shah and, told
What they had heard about that guiltless dame.
‘He asked: “ Hath that good lady further wishes ?”
She sent to say: ‘‘ TI have one wish, no mote :
I fain would ope the late Shah’s charnel-house ;
42 * THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUST

I have a great desire to look on him.”’

Shirwi replied: ‘ So do, *tis natural.”
The keeper oped the door. That pious lady
Began her wailing, went and laid her face
Upon the visage of Khusrau Parwiz,
Spake of the past and took the mortal bane :!
She sent the dust up from her own swect life.
She sat beside the Shah with visage veiled,
Clad in a single camphor-scented robe ;
She set her back against the wall and died ;
She died and won the plaudits of the world.
Shirwi fell sick when he had heard the news,
For such a spectacle affrighted him.
He bade construct another sepulchre,
And make her diadem of musk and camphor.
He shut the old Shah’s charnel. Soon they gave
Shirwi the bane; the world had had its {ill
Of Shahs! Thus luckless both in birth and death
He left the throne of kingship to his son.
One reigneth seven months and in the cighth
Doth don the camphor crown! Of earth’s good things
To have possession, of the throne is best,
Of evils life cut short is evilest.

XLV
ARDSHIR, SON OF SHIRWI

HE REIGNED SIX MONTHS

ARGUMENT

Ardshir’s accession is well received by the people. Ie
makes Piraz, son of Khusrau, the captain of the host. Guraz,
on the pretext of avenging Khusrau Parwia, but really with
the intention of seizing the kingship for himsclf, schemes to
bring about the death of the Shéh who 1s murdered abt a
banquet by Pirtiz.

NOTE

Ardshir (Artaxerxes 11]., September, A.D. 628—April,
A.D. 630) was, according to Tabarf, only seven years old
at his accession. By some accounts he was only one year
old at the time.t He was of course a mere puppet in the
hands of the nobles. The “True Cross,” if the date of its
elevation at Jerusalem—Sept. 14th, A.D. 629—be correct,
must have been restored during his reign.? ;

$1. The Arabic Tabarf says that the realm was administered
by Mih-Azar-Gushnasp (Mihr ’Hasis in the Persian version),
the High Steward, who had charge of the Shéh’s person.
This may account for his being made out to be a rogicide in
the Sh4hndma. He really seems to have been a well-inten-
tioned man who did his best in very difficult: circumstances.
At all events, according to the Persian Tabarf, Shahrbardz,
after taking possession of Ctesiphon, slew him and other
eis on the pretext of avenging the death of Khusrau

arwiz. : :

§2. It appears that Shahrbardiz (Gurdz) was not con-
sulted when Ardshir was raised to the throne, and he made
this an excuse for taking violent measures. The occasion
was a favourable one for an ambitious general in command
of an army. Moreover, he had an understanding, confirmed
by matrimonial alliances, with Heraclius, who no doubt
promised to recognise him if he became Shah. He accordingly
marched upon Ctesiphon with 6,000 or, according to another
account, 60,000 troops. The High Steward made an attempt
at resistance, but Shahrbar4z with the connivance of the
captain of the guard and other chiefs was successful and the
usual scenes of outrage and massacre ensued.!

§ 1

How Ardshir, Son of Shirwt, ascended the Throne and
harangued the Chiefs

Now as the next confronting me I voice
The reign of Shah Ardshir, I have no choice.
When Shah Ardshir sat on the throne both young
And old flocked to him from Iran, for many
Were chiefs grown old, to hear what he would say.?
The young Ardshir then loosed his tongue and thus
He spake: ‘ Ye well-tried warriors! may one,
Whoe’er he be, that sitteth on the seat
Of sovereignty possess an open mind,
And worship God. We will ensue the course
Of former Shahs, ensue too Grace and Faith.
May we remember God who giveth good,
May all our acts be just ! I will advance
The pious and make tyrants bleed. I trust
The army to Piriz, son of Khusrau,
Who loveth equity and loyal lieges.

They for their part with such a paladin
Still will be happy and serene of soul.”

Full many were contented with his specch ;
A peaceful ruler was the wish of cach.

§2

How Gurdz was displeased at Ardshtr being Shah and
how he caused Ardshir to be slain by Piruz, Sun of
Khusrau

Then tidings reached Gurdz, who had involved
Khusrau Parwiz in sorrow and distress,

And he dispatched from Rim a man to say :—
‘The crown of vile Shirwi is in the dust.

Hell take his soul and be his charnel-house C. 2051
O’erturned! Who ever knew a lofty cypress
Wrecked in the garden by the grass, and one
Like to Khusrau Parwiz, whose peer as king
Time’s eye and heart perceive not, who bestowed
My greatness on me, and I have not turned
From his behest ? Now fate dethroneth him,
And fortune’s face is utterly averse ;

The circling heaven is his foe and maketh

His portion to be hidden in the earth ;

The sun and moon amerce him of his sway,

And take the crown and throne from such a king,
Bestow the sovereignty upon Shirwi,

And give up all fran to wretchedness !

When he passed and Ardshfr assumed the crown
Both young and old rejoiced. in him, but I,

‘If I have any portion in fran, |

Will suffer not our country’s air to breathe
46 © THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

Upon him. Have I not received the news

Of Shah Khusrau Parwiz wrecked by the words
Of one of evil mark? I will not have

A king like this one though the age be Shahless,
For there is much contention in his head,

And he adviseth with another host.

Now will I come in force with chosen chiefs
Of Rim and of Iran, and we shall see

What sort of Head that is to whom such schemes
Appeal. I will uproot him so that never
Shall he name kingship more.”
He sent a runner

To seek the ancients of the franian host,
And strove in other fashion to advance
His ill designs by writing to Pirtz,
Son of Khusrau, thus: ‘‘ The Sasanians’ fortune
Is louring and we need a world-aspirant
To gird himself for action. Haply thou
Art ware of what to do and how to take
The needful steps, wilt seek for many helpers,
Both young and old, wilt clear away Ardshir,
And afterwards attain thy whole desire,
Be safe and well contented; but if thou
Reveal this plot, and fced the sword of war
With blood, I will lead forth such hosts from Rum
That I shall make the world dark in thine eyes.
Heed well my words, and mayst thou think no scorn
Of mine intent; thou must not fall through folly.
Oh! pass not from the ‘throne of majesty.

To underneath the dust. Repentance then

Will not avail thee’ wheh in wreak my sword
Is reaping heads.”

: When he had, read that letter and perceived
‘The whole intendment of that self-willed man,

Gh 2092 Much pondered on thie: inabter and consulted
ARDSHIR, SON OF SH/fRIVI 47

The ancicnt magnates, saying: “ This affair
Hath come upon me unawares and like
A revelation !”
This was their reply :—
‘Famed and redoubted chicftam! if our Shah
Shall perish we shall rightly perish too
For such a crime. Let not Guraz’ words move thee
To perpetrate such ill, but take occasion
For doing good. Write him a fitting answer,
And wake him from his dream. Say: ° Thwart not
thou
xod’s purposes ; give not the Div a way
To thine own heart. Reflect upon the case
Of Shah Khusrau Parwiz and all the wrong
That Ied to his undoing, for what Lime
Thou didst depose him the Sdsdnian fortune
Went at one blow, and when Shirwi ascended
The royal throne and girt his kingly lois
Folk hoped such days as when Khusrau Parwiz
Was Shah whose wits were kcen in all regards,
And if the world beeame what it became,
And gat no profit from the state of things,
It was because the world dealt foolishly,
And by one stroke lost its advantages.
Now that Ardshir, suececding to Kubad,
Is seated as the Shah upon the throne,
The world rejoicing in his majesty,
And earth and time exulting in his Grace,
Why should the world, now tranquil, he couvulsed
By pain 7 war? Knock not at evils’ door ;
Those that slay blameless kings will prosper not.
In this strife circling heaven must not raise
frén in dust. I fear that God will end
The frénians’ term for ills more heinous still.’ ”

Be ever chicf !) —a profitable Ictter,
And thou hadst said that one had got his heart
Between the shears when he had read those words.
In fierce wrath with Pirtiz, son of Khusrau,
He gathered all his baggage and commanded
The host to march forth plainwards. At the news
Pirtiz dispatched a cameleer to go
In all haste to Tukhar to summon him,
Informing him at large of the affair,
Of what Gurdz was doing and the strife
About the imperial throne. Then from Tukhar
This answer reached Pirtz, son of Khusrau :—
“‘ Risk not the blood of the Iranian chiefs,
O noble man! but hear what saith Gurdz.
Since thou hast written on such wise perchance
Fle may not come to fight with thee.”
Now when

Pirtiz, son of Khusrau, had seen that letter
His heart had no repose from evil thoughts,
But gloomed with thinking how to harm the Shah,
Whose wont if was to summon him, for he
Was an observant man and eloquent,
And served as minister and treasurer.
He came one dark night for an audience,
And found the wince bright and the welcome warm.
Ardshir was seated in his palace-hall r
In company with many young and old,
And when Pirtz, son of Khusrau, came raised,
Thou wouldst have said, his head to heaven, called
For harp, and all the hall was filled with music.
Piriz, son of Khusrau, when midnight came,
Had. drunk one mant of wine while the companions
Of Shéh Ardshir were all bemused ; no minstrel
Was left that kept his wits. The miscreant

Alone remained. That man of outrage rosc,
Laid hand upon the Shah’s lips unawares,
And held it there until Ardshir was dead.
The palace filled with scimitars and arrows.
All there—ambitious youths and warriors—
Were fautors of Pirdz, son of Khusrau.
Upon this manner ceased Ardshir to be
When he had had six months of sovereignty.

ARGUMENT

Gutadz, hearing of Ardshir’s death, marches on Taisaftin and
urged on by his younger, though dissuaded by his elder son,
usurps the throne. His rule described. A plot is formed
against him and he is slain while returning from the chase.
The throne remains vacant tor a while.

NOTE

Cf. note to previous reign. Gurdz (Shahr-Barz, April
2vth—June 9th, A.D. 630) reigned for forty days. He was
one of the three chief generals employed by Khusrau Parwtz
in his long war against the Eastern Roman Empire. His
real name, according to Tabarf, was Farruh4n. This in
Pahlavi would be Farrukhén, which by a misreading has
become Faréy{n in the Shéhndma. Shahrbardz (Shahrgurdz,
or Shahrwardz) is, says Tabarf, a title. Firdausf uses the
shortened form Gurdéz, which means “ boar,” because it
is more convenient metrically. The title may have been
appropriate enough. In the Shéhnéma the general is split
‘up into two personalities—Gurdz or Fardyin, the usurper,
and Shahraénguréz, the avenger of the breach made by the
upstart In the sacred line of Sdés4nian succession.2 In Tabarf
the leader of the revolt is a native of Istakhr named Pusfar-
‘rukh.? Shahranguréz in the Sh&bnéma is also of the same

He sped to Taisaftin, his soldicrs’ hands
All had been bathed in blood. When he arrived
The chicfs went out to weleome him, but none
Among the troops dared breathe for they were few. — €. 2054
Gurdz, on entering the city, stayed not
For minister and counscllor but chose
A void place, and the magnates privily
Conferred with him. Pirtz, son of Khusrau,

Whom hast thou chosen to be king of kings,
And illustrate the crown of majesty ?”’

The warrior Gur4z made answer thus :—
“IT have not any secrets from Tran.
To-morrow look ye out for some new Shah
To sit like some new moon upon the throne.”

Walk not, if thou canst help it, foeliahly.

It is the best of man’s accomplishnients,
The world’s endeavour and the way of God.
Of things that grace one not there is no need
To speak at larg ge for he will foolishly
Disgrace himself howe’er he may exalt
The case in point. When wisdom hath deserted
The head, and shame the eye, fame and disgrace,
And cold and hot, are one—no terror this
To any coward whether quick or dead.
Make, if thou canst, all good thy business
Because the world abideth not with any.
Let all thy usance be humanity,
Munificence and uprightness thy Faith.

When Fardyin assumed the royal crown
He uttered what was in his mind and said :-—
‘“‘ Let me assume the kingship for a while,
And sit upon the throne of gold in joy.
Far better scatter wealth and be exalted
Than purchase sixty years of servitude.
Thus will I sit a while in sovercignty,
Arrayed in satin and in painted silk,
And after me my son shall take my throne,
Assume this royal crown, be king as was
His sire, and be exalted and renowned.
Whoe’er shall minister to our delight
Shall be a happy man among mankind.
In feast-time we will drink with joyful hearts,
In war-time we will hunt our enemies.’

His elder son said privily to him :—
‘* Who of us, father! ever wore the crown ?
Feel not secure, take means to compass wealth ;
Thou wast the world’s protector; keep to that. |
If any member of the royal race
Shalt come thou wilt not long be here ; thy heart,
will keep of kingship only grief and pain ;

ae Or " beaver-skins,” :
GURAZ (ALSO CALLED FARAYIN) 53

Thou wilt be wretched, destitute, and wan.”
Then said the younger son: “"Phou hast become — C. 2055
Crowned 11 the world and hast’ both troops and
treasures
Befitting royalty, but treasurcless
Wilt have to labour still. What ancestor
Of Faridin, who had Abtin to sire,
K’er wore the crown ? Hold fast the world by courage
And treasure. Nobody is born a king.’*!
The younger’s words pleased Fardyin the best,
Who bade his elder son: “ Be not so raw.”
He laid out in the royal offices
The muster-roll and called all troops to court.
He gave drachms night and day and many robes
Of honour ill-deserved. Within two wecks
Of all the treasury of Shah Ardshir
Remained not what would buy an arrow’s plume!
Whene’er Guraz would go forth to the pleasanec
The lights were torches made of ambergris,
Four score before and four seore alter him :
Behind them came his friends and partisans.
Of gold and silver were the goblets all,
The golden gem-encrusted.2 “T'was his use
To feast all night. The nobles’ hearts were full
Of vengeance on him. “T'was his wont to roam
A-nights the gardens and the riding-ground.
Save but to sleep and wake, to eat and plunder,
That slight, weak-witted one knew naught. He went
Drunk ever to repose and with a sash
From Chin about his head. The troops were all
Vexed to the heart at him while all the province
Was full of turmoil and distress. He lost
All trace of generosity and grew
Unjust, unfortunate, and good for naught.

And at his handling people smote their heads.
He shed the blood of innocents until
The troops grew wroth with him. He used to shut
His eyes for gold and would have sold the world
To win dinars. Folk cursed him. All desired
His death and meeting privily discussed
His deeds. Hurmuzd Shahranguraz, a horseman
Redoubted of the city of Istakhr—
The glory of the chieftains—thus addressed
One night the Iranians secr etly : “ Ye chiefs !
The time of Fardyin is proving gricvous ;
He holdeth all the chiefs in ight esteem.
Why have your brains and hearts become thus
straitened ?

Through him all eyes are tearful, livers charged
With blood. Is no physician to be found ?
He is. not royal or Sdsdnian ;
Why gird the loins before him ? Of a truth
Your hearts have flown out of your breasts or else
Your pluck hath disappeared ! ”

The folk replied :—
‘* Since there was no one left fit for the throne
None is inspired by jealousy to take
This base-born’s heart away ; but we adopt
Thy counsel. Tell us from thy stores of lore
How to release fran from this insane
And hot-brained Shah ill both in word and deed.
May he be never blessed ! ”

Shahranguraz
Replied : * The frénians have suffered long.
If ye will harm me not but play the Persian
E’en now by holy God’s aid will I bring him
Down oe his throne to dust. en

_ He gat. this answer Se

May no Hartt come to thee | ! All we the host.

‘To-day are thy supporters ‘and thy stronghold —

Tf il] herefrom befall thee.”

Ilcaring this
That royal warrior sought how to sct
Hands on the worthless Shah. Now he one day
Took order and departed from the city
To hunt, and of the Iranians a troop
Of lords and lieges fared, escorting him.
He urged his courser on and rode about
As *twere Azargashasp, the cavaliets
Encireling him and beating up the game.
Now at what time they turned back city-wards
Shahringuraz looked at the hapless Shah
With boldness, chose an arrow from his quiver,
One that was straight and had a point of steel,
And urged his bk ck steed while the host looked on.
He stretched the bow and drew it out at whiles
To chest or head, then notched, as if in sport,
An arrow on the string and drew the bow
Till it concealed the point, and loosed his thumb.
Forthwith the shaft struck on the monarch’s back,
Who dropped his whip. The arrow was all blood
Up to the feathers and the iron head
Protruded from his navel. All the troops
Unsheathed and all that night while dust-clouds rose
They plied their swords and knew not whom they

fought,

But took and gave back blows and cursed or blessed
That deed. Now when the yellow Veil appeared,
So that the world seemed like a leopard’s back,
There was a multitude of slain and maimed,
And cavaliers and leaders were astound,
That great host was dispersed like timid sheep C, 2057
When they perceive a wolf. Long they remained
Without a king: nore cared to claim the crown.
For long they sought and sought in vain to trace
’ Some royal scion of the noble race.

PURANDUKIIT
SHE REIGNED SIX MONTHS

NOTH

Purandukht (Puranducht, summer A.D. 630—autumn
A.D). 631), reigned, according to Tabari, for one year and
four months. Her name, it appears, should be spelt with a
B, not with a P. She is said to have restored the “ True
Cross,” but it seems more probable that this was done in the
reign of Ardshir. She made the leader of the successful
conspiracy against Shahrbardz her prime minister.! She
was the first historical female Sh&h and it was in allusion to
her reign and that of her sister Azarmdukht that the distich
is quoted in Mir Khénd :-—

“ No dignity remains in a houschold
In which the hens are crowing like cocks,’’?

There may be none aggrieved because his pain

She made search for Pirtiz, son of Khusrau,
Who was delated by an alien,
Whereat she chose some warriors from the host
Who brought Pirtiz before her. She exclaimed :-—
‘ Foul-purposed miscreant !? thou shalt receive,
As infamous, the guerdon for thy deeds.”

She bade bring from the stalls a colt unbroken,
And bound, firm as a rock, Pirtiz thereto
Without a saddle and with yoke on neck.
The vengeful lady had. that untamed stecd
Brought to the riding-ground and thither sent,
With lassos coiled up in their saddle-straps,

AZARMDUKHT

SHE REIGNED FOUR MONTHS

NOTE

Before Azarmdukht (Azermidocht, end of A.D. 631—
beginning of A.D. 632) came to the throne there seems to
have been a short interval during which a distant scion of the
royal House, who took the name of Pirdz, ruled for less than a
month. The chief noble of the time, who was governor of
Khurdsén, wished to make Azarmdukht his wite on which she
had him privately executed. This noble’s son was the Rustam
that fought and fell at Kadisiya some years later. On
hearing of his father’s fate Rustam, who was in temporary
authority in Khurdsdin, marched with a great army against
Azarmdukht, overthrew her and put her to death after she
had reigned six months. ILer name probably means “ modest
girl.’”?

S1
How Azarmdukht ascended the Throne and how she died

There was another dame hight Azarmdukht,
Who had fruition of the crown of greatness.

She came, sat down upon the royal throne,

And made herself the mistress of the world.

Her first words were: “‘ O sages, veterans,

And masters of affairs! be just in all,  °

She filled the throne four months,
But with the fifth disaster came thereto,
For she too died, the throne had not a Shah,
But was the plaything of the ill-disposed.

HE REIGNED ONE MONTII

NOTE

Between, and even carlier than, the death of Azarmdukht
and the accession of Yazdagird TI., the order of the dynastic
succession becomes very confused. The names of the Shahs
vary in the different lists. The reason is that it was a period
of great internal unrest and various aspirants to the throne
held contemporancously some short-lived authority in different
provinces of the empire. One of these princes, Farrukhzdd
(Fatrukhzéd-Khusrau) has received the honour of being
included in the list of the Sh&hs as recorded in the Shéhndma.
Two accounts of the length of his reign are given in Tabarf.
According to one, it lasted for six months, according to the
other, for a year. Both agree that he did not die a natural
death, and one of them states that his death was instigated
by the adherents of Yazdagird.}

And said: “ Son of the kings of kings am I,
And would have naught but quiet in the world.

-The mischief-maker shall not be exalted

While I am Shah, but him that from his heart
Ensueth right, and is not mischievous,
Will I hold dear as my pure soul, and seek not
To harm the harmless. Him that beareth toil
On our behalf we will reward with treasure.
We will hold dear all friends and raise the fame
Of chieftains everywhere, but all my subjects,
Both friends and enemies, are safe with me.”
The troops all blessed him: ‘‘ Ne’er may earth and
time
Lack thee.”’? Yet when his throne was one month old
The head of all his fortune came to dust.
He had a slave, a cypress-tree in stature,
Fair, lusty, and well-liking. That knave’s name
Was 'Siyah Chashm.t May heaven ne’er bring his
like !
The Shah too had a handmaid whom he loved.
She chanced on Siyah Chashm all unawares
One day, who sent to say: “ If thou wilt meet me
At such a place thou shalt have endless gifts,
And I will deck thy crown with jewelry.”
The handmaid heard, made no reply, but went
And told the thing to Farrukhzad who raged,
And. could not eat or sleep in his concern.
He put the feet of Siyah Chashm in fetters,
And cast him into prison. When the knave
Had been confined awhile the Shah released him,

For many pled for him. The slave returned
To serve the Shah and cut his lifetime short,
| For just as such a bad malignant, slave

Would do he sought revenge upon the Shah,

And seizing on a time when, Farrukhzéd.

Reposed himself put poison in the wine.
The Shah drank, lived one week, and all that heard
About his fate lamented hin. The kingship
Was in extremities and focs appeared
On every side. The throne of king of kings,
Through these ill doings of the Iranians,
Was overturned.
Of such a fashion are
Time’s revolutions! Let it be thy care
To gather for thyself therefrom thy share.
Eat what thou hast and trust the morrow not,
For it may hold for thee a different lot :
To give to others it may take from thee.
Thou callest this a world and verily
It doth whirl! So enjoy thine own, let go
The surplusage that thou hast toiled for so
To other folk but never to thy foe,
Klse whensoe’cr thy day is overpast
Thy hoards will be as is the desert-blast,
Thy treasures all become thine enemy’s ;
So give away to set thy mind at ease.

YAZDAGIRD

HE REIGNED TWENTY YEARS

ARGUMENT

Yazdagird becomes Shéh. The country is invaded by the
Arabs. He sends Rustam, the captain of the host, to oppose
them. Rustam takes a despondent view of the situation,
and after some attempt at negotiations is defeated by the Arabs
at KAdisiya and slain. The war continues, and Yazdagird
withdraws to Khurasén to get help from Méhwi of Sur, the
governor. Méhwi plots with Bizhan, a Turkish prince,
against Yazdagird, who is betrayed in battle and takes refuge
in a mill, where he is slain by the miller at the bidding of
Mahwi. Méhwi assumes the crown, makes war on Bizhan,
is taken prisoner, and put to death. The poem ends with a
brief passage, in which Firdaus{ gives some account of the
completion of his undertaking, of help afforded him and of
discouragements undergone, and concludes with a well founded
assurance of his own future fame.

NOTE

Vazdagird (Isdegird III., A.D. 632-652 or 653) has given
his name to a chronological era which still obtains among the
_ Parsis. It dates from June 16th, A.D. 632. He was the son

‘of Shéhryaér, son of Khusrau Parwiz, and was an infant at

the time when that, Sh4h, and: his sons were put to death

after the accession of Shirwi (Kubéd,") On that occasion —
he was taken for eas to Istakhr. Tabart says that he wags

murdered at the age of twenty-eight alter a reign of twenty
years. He was therefore only eight years old when a party
among the nobles set him up as a puppet king at Istakhr
(Persepolis), the old seat of empire, Ctesiphon at that time
being in the hands of a rival claimant of the throne. In the
contention that followed Yazdagird was successful, and in
the course of A.D. 633 he became recognised as sole Shah,
the administration remaining in the hands of the chiefs. .
He had succeeded to a heritage of woe. His empire was
ill-prepared for the troubles that were in store for it. Ex-
hausted by long wars, torn by domestic dissentions, and
lately devastated by plague, it had to confront a new and
vigorous organization inspired by religious enthusiasm and
impelled thereby to extend its borders on every side. Had
Yazdagird been a born leader of men and come to the throne
in the prime of life, he might for the time at least have been
successful, but in the circumstances, and taking into con-
sideration what we can gather as to his own character, we
can now see how hopeless from the outset his prospects were.
Students of Persian, however, have probably reason to feel
grateful to his reign, for even though we put aside as unsatis-
factory what tradition tells us on the subject, a reasonable
presumption remains that with the return of settled govern-
ment to a distracted country there was a revival of interest
in the story of the [ranian race and its heroes, and that com-
pilations were then made from which we still though indirectly
benefit.”

§§ 2-11. The following is intended to supplement Firdausi’s
inadequate account of the Arab conquest of the Sdsdnian
empire. He appears to assign it to the last years of Yaz-
dagird’s then nominal sovereignty. From time immemorial
the [rénians and Semites had been at enmity. In Irdnian
legend this feeling had found expression in the story of the
wicked Sh&h Zahhék, who, though originally an Aryan
myth,* came to be regarded in succeeding ages as an earthly
king with his seat at Babylon. When, later still, the [rénians
again felt the weight of Semitic oppression, he was turned
into an Arab.® Although during Sds4nian times the semi-
independent kingdom ef. Hfra served to some extent as a
buffer-state between the Persian, empire and the wilder Arab

tribes there was always the liability of raids and the danget
was much increased when Khusrau Parwiz was so unwise
as to put an end to the long-standing dynasty of the princes
of Hira and appointed a governor of his own in their stead?
In his reign too had occurred the disastrous battle of Dhi
Kar, in which the smallness of the forces engaged were out
of all proportion to the importance of the result. The Arabs
celebrated their victory with songs of triumph.? With that
inspiring memory and revelation of Persian weakness, with
the prospect of rich spoil to be won, and a nation of infidels
to be converted, it is not surprising that hostilities should
break out between the young and vigorous and the old and
enfecbled empire. Muhammad himself, tradition tells us,
addressed a threatening letter to Khusrau Parwiz, who tore
it up, and the Prophet, on hearing of this, said: “ He has
rent his own réalm.’?: Muhammad died in June, A.D. 632—~
the month of the child Yazdagird’s accession. Abt Bakr,
the first Khalifa, being apprised by an Arab chieftain, who
had embraced Islam, of the state of the Persian empire,
sent his great general, Khalid, to begin hostilities. Khélid
was very successful In numerous engagements, and tem-
porarily the whole tract bordering the western bank of the
Kuphrates from the Roman frontier almost to the Persian
Gulf came into the hands of the Arabs. Khalid made Hira
his headquarters, and was preparing to attack Ctesiphon
and invade [r4n when he was recalled by Abu Bakr to take
command of the forces destined for the Syrian campaign.
‘“ This is'*Umar’s doing,” said Khélid. “‘ He does not want
to see me conquer “Irak.”4 The departure of Khalid was the
Persians’ opportunity. Encouraged by Rustam, who under
Yazdagird had become commander-in-chief, the inhabitants
of the conquered region rose against the Arabs but unsuccess-
fully. At ‘this’ juncture Abi Bakr died and was siicceeded
by "Umar, who began his reign by giving Abii ’Ubaida the
chief command in Syria in the place of Khélid. Then, it
is said, he appealed ‘publicly to the Faithful to volunteer
for the invasion of Persia and for two days in vain, the super-
session of Khalid: having caused great indignation. It may,
however, have been thought that’ the acquisition of so much
fertile territory and the consequent proximity to the Persian

capital, were a sufficient achievement for the time being.
Nevertheless, on the third day, when "Umar made his appeal,
Abt ’Ubaida (not Khalid’s successor) offered himself and
Sa’ad, son of Wakkds, followed suit. A thousand others
imitated their example. "Umar gave Abit ’Ubaida the chief
command as he had been the first to volunteer. The Persians
in the meantime had withdrawn to Ctesiphon, whence Rustam
dispatched a force, which had with it the flag of Kawa,!
to watch the enemy. Abt ’Ubaida, who was very inferior
in numbers, threw a bridge across the Euphrates, attacked the
Persians, was defeated and slain. This battle is known as
“The Battle of the Bridge,” and took place in November,
A.D. 634. An attack, however, by the Persians on Hira
failed, and the Arabs raided the Persian settlement of Baghdad
(not of course the well-known city of that name*) where
twice a year a fair was held. *Umar appointed Sa’ad, son of
W akkas, to succeed Aba ’Ubaida, and both sides made efforts
to reinforce their respective armics. The Persian adherents
west of the Huphrates again rose. Rustam crossed the tiver
with a great host, and advanced to Kadistya where the Arabs
had concentrated. The battle that ensued is said to have
lasted four days with varying fortune till a dust-storm turned
the scale in favour of the Arabs. The slaughter was very
great and so was the spoil. ’Umar forbade the Arabs to make
any further advance for the present, but as the situation
of their camp proved to be very unhealthy he directed Sa’ad
to choose a more suitable site, whereupon Sa’ad founded
Kifa. Thenceforth the whole of the region west of the
Kuphrates was lost to the Persians. To secure the lower
course of the Kuphrates and Tigris "Umar also founded Basra,
west of the Shatt-al-Arab. Tho battle of Kaédisiya seems to
have been fought A.D. 636-7, but the chronology of the period
is somewhat uncertain. Then came a considerable pause in
the Arab advance. The Arabs seem to have spent the in-
terval well in securing what they had gained while the Persians
on the other hand appear to have been paralysed by their
misfortunes. At all events, when the invasion was resumed
and Sa’ad, crossing the Euphrates, marched on Ctesiphon,
no resistance was offered and Yazdagird, who had lingered
there too late to secure the removal ot most of his treasures,
fled with his court to Hulwin.? His example of flight seems

to have been followed by a majority of the inhabitants. The
Arabs came in for an immense hooty according to Oriental
accounts. If, however, we take into consideration the
domestic troubles of the years preceding Yazdagird’s accession,
and what must have been the financial needs of the short-lived
Shdhs of that period, we are justified in suspecting that the
amount of precious metals and of the more portable forms
of wealth generally was not so great as has been affirmed.
Sa’ad, when he had established himself in the Persian capital,
asked permission of "Umar to pursue Yazdagird who had
gathered a considerable army under the command of a
Mihraén! at Jalilé in the neighbourhood ot Hulwan. “Umar
refused to allow Sa’ad to go in person and instructed him to
send instead Hashim who was cither his brother or his nephew.
Hashim was much inferior in point of numbers, and it was
six months before he brought the Persians to a decisive en-
gagement. He then won a complete victory, and followed
up his success at Jalilé by the capture of Hulwin. Yazdagird
fled to Rai and ’Umar, content for the moment with what
had been achieved, forbade any further advance. The next
stage of the Arab conquest was made outside the sphere. of
Sa’ad’s authority, who sent, however, by "Umar’s command
troops to assist. In the north Mesopotamia, and in the
south Khizistén, were invaded and annexed. A raid was
made, also across the Persian Gulf from Bahrain into Pars,
but without lasting results, as the Arab forees got into diffi-
culties and had to be rescued by an expedition sent for the
purpose from Basra. About A.D. 640 in consequence, it
is said, of complaints made by the people of Kuta, Umar
recalled Sa’ad and Yazdagird seized the opportunity to make
a supreme effort to recover his lost possessions. A large
army, summoned from the yet unconquered provinces of the
empire, was concentrated at Nahdvand, some fifty miles
south of Hamadan, and placed under a Persian general named
Pirizén. On this "Umar ordered Nu’mén, who was in com-
mand in Khizistén, to gather all available forces from the
regions already annexed and march against the enemy.
Numan, who was greatly inferior in point of numbers, found
the Persians strongly encamped at Nah&vand and tried in
vain to bring ona general engagement. In the end he managed
to effect his purpose by means of a stratagem. He broke up

his camp and made a hasty retreat. Pfrizin went in pursuit,
on which Nwman turned upon lim and won what the Arabs
call “The Victory of Victories” (A.D. 641-2). Pirdzan
was taken prisoner and slain, and Nwindn himself fell in the
fight. This was the last effort of the Persians ab a national
resistance. Henceforth their opposition was merely pro-
vincial or local, and wholly ineffective. One after another
the remaining provinces of the Saésdnian empire were over-
run by the Arabs and permanently annexed, while Yazdagird,
who had ficd from Rai after the disaster of Nahavand, re-
mained a fugitive till his death some ten years later.

the governor of Khurdsén, who was slain, it is said, by Avarm-
dukht and avenged by his son.) Khurdsdn probably formed
part of the satrapy of Nimriz, one of the four into which N lshifr-
win divided his empire? Tradition makes the governors
ot that satrapy, and their sons play a very important part
during the last few years of the Sdsdnian dynasty.? The
position of commander-in-chief held hy Rustam at the battle
of Kadisfya, probably indicates that he had heen instrumental
in bringing about the elevation of Yazdagird to the throne.“

Rustam’s brother was named Farrukhzéd.

§3. Mughfra, son of Shu’ba, was one of the companions
of Muhammad, and played a prominent role in the affairs of
the time. He went on a similar embassy to the Persians
before the battle of Nahévand.6 He was governor for a time
at Basra,® Mecca,” and Kiifa, where he died in A.D. 670.°

$4. Ga’ad took no personal part in the battle of Kaddisfya.
He was suffering from sores at the time and had to content
himself with merely directing operations.’ Consequently
he did not slay Rustam in single combat as Firdausf states.
When the dust-storm came on the fourth day of the battle,
Rustam was seated under an awning erected on the bank
of the canal of Kadisfya and surrounded by the camels that
carried his treasure. The awning was blown into the water.
and Rustam took shelter among them. In the confusion
caused by the storm, the Arabs broke the Persian contre.
One of them, named Hildl, striking in the darkness at random
among the camels, happened to hit the one under which

§§ 9-11. There is a general agreement in Persian tradition
that Yazdigird did not die a natural death. The scene of it
is mostly laid at Marv, and the most popular version assoviates
it with a mill. Firdausi’s story evidently has been worked up
as the appeals addressed to Mahwi show. The villain’s
guilt too is more emphasized, and he is made more directly
responsible for the tragedy. Elsewhere the miller murders
the Shah for mere greed. Marv appears to be a likely place
for Yazdagird to have chosen to reside in, as he could easily
escape thence across the Oxus in case of need. In some
accounts he does cross and negotiates to little purpose with
the Turks, but is brought back across the river for the final
scene. What the truth of the matter was seems to be quite
uncertain.

§14. According to the account in the Persian Tabarf,
Mahwi, after the death of Yazdagird, remained at Marv till
he was compelled to leave owing to the approach of the Arabs,
when he fled across the Oxus and took refuge with the Turks.
Their Khan is the Bizhan of the Shahnama.

That sun and moon revolved above his head.

How Saad, Son of Wakkds, invaded Irén, how Yazda-
gird sent Rustam to oppose him, and how Rustam
wrote a Letter to his Brother

It was so that "Umar, the famous Arab,
Commander of the Faithful, he whose sword
Turned day to night, the man approved by God,
Who hath no equal, sent the chosen Sa’ad,
Son of Wakkas, with troops against the Shh.
When Arab fortune worsted Persian,
And the Sdsanians’ fortune had grown dark,
The world had had full measure of its Shéhs :
Gold was not seen, the mite was manifest,
Good turned. to evil, evil turned to good,
The path lay Hellward, not to Paradise,
The wheel of circling heaven was changed and cut
All kindness for the Persians clean away.
The slave must do the almighty Maker’s will,
And bear what He inflicteth. Save with Him
There is no life or joy. |

_ Learned what had chanced he gathered troops on all
: sides, : the a)
C, 2062 And bade Hurmuzd’s son lead them forth, His name
‘He assumed this.title,
YAZDAGIRD 73

Was Rustam. He was wary, wise, a warrior
And potentate, a reader of the stars,

Exceeding shrewd and all attent to hear

The archimages’ words. He marched away
With all the noble, those that were alert

And brave, and after thirty months they sought
To fight at Kadistya. Being learned

In heaven’s lore as an astrologer,

And one both just and good, he said: ‘* No time
Is this to fight, the river of the Shahs

Will flow not in this bed,” and so he took

His astrolabe, observed the stars and smote

His head because it was a day of bale,

Then wrote in grief! and told his brother all,
First offering praise to God who had ordained
His good and evil fortune, and proceeded :—
‘Well may the revolutions of the sky

Fill the observer with disquictude !

I am the guiltiest person of the time,

And therefore have been caught by Ahriman,
Because the kingship passeth from this House ;
No season this of conquest and the Grace !
From the fourth heaven Sol is looking down

To hasten to the fight of mighty men.

Both Mars and Venus bode mishap to us,

And none can ’scape high heaven. Mercury
And Saturn are opposed, the former too

Hath entered Gemini. Such is the case,

A great event is toward, and my heart

Is weary of its life. I can discern

All that will be but fain would hold my peace.
When I agnized this secret of the sky—

That it assigneth us but grievous’ travail—

I wept right sorely for the frdénians, ' |
And burned for the Sds4nians. Woe is me _ |

For majesty, for fortune, and for Grace

Because hereafter will defeat betide them

From the Arabians, the stars not turn

Save to our hurt, and for four hundred years
None of our royal race will rule the world !

An envoy from our foemen came to me,

And divers parleyings followed. ‘ We,’ they said,
‘Will give up to the Shah the tract between

The river-bank and Kadisiya; ye

Shall grant us access to some trading centre
That we may sell and buy; we will not ask

For more hereafter ; we will pay large dues,

And will not seek the chieftains’ diadems,

But will obey withal the king of kings,

And render hostages at his demand.’

Such is the talk. No action hath ensued,

But still the stars are adverse. Long will be
The strife. Fierce Lions will be slain by hundreds.
The chieftains that, are with me in the war—
Galbwi of Tabaristan and Armani,

Who do the deeds of Ahriman in fight,

Mahwi, he of Surdn, and other chiefs,

Who wield the heavy mace and battle-ax—
Heed not our foes proposals but observe :—
‘Who are these haughty folk and what do they
Both in fran and in Mazandaran ?

For road and territory, weal and woe,

We must employ the mace and scimitar ;

We will exert ourselves, quit us like men, .

And make the world both dark and strait to them.’
None of them knoweth circling heaven’s design,
And how its aspect hath been changed to us.

On teading this, take measures with the chiefs,
Make preparations and lead forth the host,
Collect the treasures, handmaids, and statc-robes,

' Then hasten Azar Abédagan—

Whatever herds of horses thou miuyst have

Send to the treasurer of Azargashasp.

If soldiers seek thee from Zabulistan,

Or from Iran, imploring thy protection,

Reccive and treat with kindness their excuses

In view of what the turning sky is doing—-

The cause of joy and terror to us all,

At whiles exalting and at whiles abasing.

Let mother know my words for of a truth

She will not look upon my face again.

Grect her from us and counsel her at large

Not to be troubled here below. If any

Shall bring bad news of me be not too downeast,
For know that in this Wayside Hostelry,

He that amasseth treasure by his toil

Will find his toil more than such worldly treasure,
And that another will enjoy the fruit.

What need. was there for so much toil and ereed ?
Desire is lessened not by having more.

At all times worship God and purge thy heart
Of all affection for this Wayside Inn

Because our fortune is in straits, the king
Will see me not again. Do thou and _all

Our House, both old and young, unceasingly .
Praise God and pray the Maker, for with this

First give thine own head to the scimitar
Ungrudgingly. When pulpit fronteth throne,
And when Abt Bakr and ’Umar shall be

And long will be the fall before the rise.

Thou wilt not see throne, diadem, or state :

The stars award the Arabs everything.?

There will not be throne, crown, or golden boot,
Or gem, or coronet or flaunting flag.

One man will toil, another will enjoy ;

None will give heed to justice or to bounty.’
Then warriors will be men that fight afoot
While horsemen will be mocked and flouted at ;
The warlike husbandman will be despised,

High birth and majesty will bear no fruit ;

Then men will rob each other, none will iow
A blessing from a curse, and secret dealing
Prevail o’er open, while the hearts of men

Will turn to flint, sire will be foe to son,

And son will scheme ’gainst sire; a worthless slave
Will be the king, high birth and majesty

Will count for nothing; no one will be loyal.
There will be tyranny of soul and tongue.

A mongrel’ race-—{ranian, Turkman, Arab— —
Will come to be and talk in gibberish?
They will collect ‘all treasures ‘neath their skirts,
Toil and resign the product to their foes. os

Grief, travail, bitterness will thus prevail

As joy did in Bahram Gutr’s days; feasts, song,

Race and renown will cease; men will set traps,

Will seek their profit in another’s loss,

And make their pretext Faith; no difference

Will be ’twixt Spring and Winter ;' there will be

No wine at feasts; they will not recognise

Degree and place but live on barley-bread,

And dress in wool. When much time hath passed
thus

None will regard the noble Persian stock.

They will be shedding blood for lucre’s sake,

An evil age will be inaugurate.

My heart is full, my face is wan, my mouth

Is parched, my lips are filled with sighs to think

That after I—the paladin—have gone

SdsAnian fortune shall become thus dark ;

So faithless hath revolving heaven grown,

Ta’en umbrage, and withdrawn from us its love !

If with my lance I strike a brazen mountain

I pierce it, being brazen-bodicd too,

But now my shafts with stcel-transfixing heads

Are impotent with men that wear no mail!

My sword, which felled the necks of elephants

And lions at a blow, can not cut through

An Arab skin! My knowledge bringeth loss

On loss upon me. Would that I possessed not

This wisdom since it causeth me to know

Of this ill day! The chiefs that are with me

From Kadisiya are both hardy men

And hostile to the Arabs. They expect

That this brake will be filled, that earth will run

Like the Jihtin, with our foes’ blood. None knoweth —

Because this Kadisiya i is my charnel,

My breastplate is my shroud, my helmet blood :

Such is the secret of the lofty sky.

Bind not thine own heart to my gricfs but keep

Thine eyes upon the Shah, and sacrifice

Thyself for him in fight, because the day

Of Ahriman is coming on apace

When circling heaven will show us enmity.”
When he had sealed the letter he said thus :~-

How Rustam wrote to Saad, Son of Wakkds, and how
he replied

He sent a picuenaes in swiftness like
The flash and thunder-clap to Sa’ad. They Wiote: |
In apprehension yet not in despair,
A letter on white silk and thus endorsed :—
‘This from the paladin of paladins—
The warlike Rustam, son of Hurmuzdshth!—
To Sa’ad, son of Wakkas, the prudent, wise,
And. circumspect, who hath come forth to fight.”
It thus began : .“ We still must fear the World-lord,
The Holy, who sustaineth turning heaven, |

“1Cf, Mardénshéh as a proper name and P. 59.

Whose rule is justice and benelicence.
May blessings from Him rest upon the king,
The lustre of the signet, crown, and throne,
The lord of sword, of diadem and lasso,
Whose Grace restraineth Abriman in bonds.
A hateful matter hath oceurred to us
In these uncalled for labours and this strife.
Reply to me and say who is your king,
Who thou art, what thy rule and custom are,
And whose assistance is it that ye seek
With unmailed soldiery and unmailed chief ?
Fed up with bread thou art still ravenous 5
Thou hast no elephants, no throne, no baggage.
Enough for thee to live within fran,
For crown and signet are another man’s,
Who hath Grace, elephants, and crown and throne—
A famous Shah of lengthy lincage.
No throned king hath such stature or the moon
In heaven such aspect. When enthroned he sitteth
With smiles that make his silvern teeth appear ;
His gifts would purchase Arabs in the gross,
And not impoverish his treasury.
His dogs, his hawks, and cheetahs are twelve thousand,
And they are decked. with golden bells and, varyels.
The whole waste of the wielders of the spear |
Could find not in a year from end to end
Enough to feed his cheetahs and his hounds -
When he is hunting on the plain. The Arabs,
From drinking camels’ milk and eating lizards,
Have reached a pitch whereat the Persian throne
‘Ig coveted! Shame, shame on circling heaven !
Ye have no veneration in, your eyes, —
Or, in your wisdom, love or reverence. |

Then will I send a horseman to the Shah

To ask of him whatever thou wilt ask,

But seek not with so great a king to fight,

For shame at last will come upon thy face.

His grandsire was the world-lord Nushirwan,
Whose justice made the agéd young again.

His fathers have been Shahs, and he is king ;
The age remembercth none like to him.

Misprize not thine own precedents. Regard
This letter of advice and bar not thou

Thine eyes and ears to wisdom.’? When the Ictter
Was sealed he gave it to high-born Piriz,

Son of Shaptr. To Sa’ad, son of Wakkas,

This paladin and magnates from fran,

Of ardent soul, went whelmed in iron, silver,
And gold, with golden shields and golden girdles.
On hearing, Sa’ad, that noble man, set forth,
Swift as the flying dust, to mect Piriz

With troops, forthwith dismounted and inquired
About the army and its paladin,

About the Shah, his minister and host,

The watchful leader and his provinces.

He spread his cloak beneath Pirtiz and said :—
We hold the sword and spcar to be our mates :
Brave warriors make no mention of brocade,

Of gold and silver or of food and slumber.

Ye have no part in manhood but arc like

To women with your colours, scents, and forms.
Your prowess is in donning broidery,

Adorning roofs and decorating doors.”
YAZDAGIRD 81

Pirtiz then gave the letter and told Sa’ad
The words of Rustam. Sa’ad heard, read, and
wondered.
He wrote an answer back in Arabic,
Announcing good and ul. He wrote there first
The name of God and of His messenger,
Muhammad, who directeth to the truth.
He spake of Jins and men, of what the Prophet,
The Hashimite,+ had said, the Unity
Of God, of the Kuran, of promise, warning,
Of menace and of novel usages,
Of liquid pitch, of fire, and icy cold,
Of Paradise, its streams of milk and wine,
Of camphor and of musk, of bubbling springs,
Of wine and honey and the trees of heaven.?
Then: “If the Shah accepteth the true Faith
He will obtain both worlds with joy and kingship,
And have withal the earrings and the crown,
Perpetual beauty and prosperity.
His intercessor there will be Muhammad, C. 2068

As Paradise will be thy recompense
We must not plant thorns in the garth of bale.
The personality of Yazdagird,
' This spacious world, such gardens, riding-grounds,
And halls and palaces with all the thrones
And crowns, the festivals and revelries,
Are less worth than one hair of an Hourf.
In this our Wayside Hostelry thine eyes
Are dazed by crown and treasure, and thou. trustest
Too much in ivory throne, in wealth, and signet,
In fortune and in crown. Why be concerned
About a world when one draught of cold water

As every wise man knoweth.”

Then he set

The Arab seal thereon and praised Muhammad.
The messenger of Sa’ad, son of Wakkas,

Went with all speed to Rustam. Now what time
Shivba Mughira went forth from the chicfs

To journey to the paladin, a noble,

One of the Iranians, came in from the way
Before the captain of the host, and said :—

“ A messenger hath come—a weak, old man—
Without a horse or weapons and ill-clad,

With thin sword slung about his neck and shirt
All plainly tattered.”

Rustam thus apprised

Prepared a tent-enclosure of brocade.

They laid a carpet of gold thread of Chin ;

The soldicry turned out like ants and locusts.
They set a golden ante-throne whercon

The captain of the host assumed his seat

With cight score warriors attending him—
Horsemen and lions on the day of battle—

With crowns, with violet robes, and golden boots,
With torques and earrings, while the tent-enclosure
Was royally adorned. Shu’ba Mughira,

On coming to the tent-enclosure, walked not
Upon the cloth but humbly on the ground,

And used his scimitar as walking-stick.

He sat upon the dust without a look

At any—captain of the host or chief. a
| Then Rustam said to him: “May thy soul joy,
And by its knowledge make thy body strong.” '
_Shu’ba Mughira said: “If thou, good sir! »
YAZDAGIRD 83

Acceptest the true Faith, peace unto thee.”

Now Rustam, hearing this, was vexed and frowned.
He took and gave the letter to a reader. C. 2069
That learned man told him what was writ, and Rustam
Made answer: “ Tell him: ‘Thou art neither king
Nor an aspirant to the diadem,

But thou hast seen my fortune in eclipse,
And so thy heart ambitioneth my throne.

The case is one of moment to the wise,

But thou hast not considered it. If Sa’ad
Had the Sasanian throne I well might share
His feasts and fights, but sinee the faithless stars
Bode ill, what shall I say ? This is the day
Of bale. If for my guide I take Muhammad,
And this new Faith for old, all will go wrong
Beneath this crook-backed sky, and all go hard
With us.’ But as for thee, depart in peace ;
The day of battle is no time for words.

Tell Sa’ad: * To dic with honour is a thing
Far better for me than crude parleying.”

How Rustam fought with Saad, Son of Wakkds, and

Shu’ba Mughira went his way, and Rustam

While spears ne’er ceased to smite on glittering helms.
The strife endured three days, till water failed
The [rdnians, and their warriors’ hands and steeds
Became unfit for combat. Rustam’s lips
Grew as the dust with drought, his tongue was split,
And men and horses battened on moist clay,
So grievous was the stress !

Shouts rose like thunder
From Rustam and from Sa’ad as they advaneed,
Kach from his post. Each Icft his army’s centre,
And drew off from the field. Departing thus
They came beneath a stecp-up eminence,
And there those chieftains twain assailed each other
Revengefully upon that scene of strife
Till Rustam, roaring like a thunder-clap,
Smote with his sword Sa’ad’s charger on the head,
Smote the swift charger which came headlong down,
And brave Sa’ad was unhorsed. Then Rustam reared
Aloft a trenchant blade to show to him
The Day of Doom, and was in mind to strike
His head off, but by reason of the dust
Raised by the troops they could not see each other.
Then Rustam lighted from his steed and saddle
Of leopard-skin and fastened to his belt
His charger’s reins but, while dust blinded him,
Sa’ad hurried up and smote him with the sword
Upon his helm whence blood ran down his face,
And while his eyes were blinded by the gore
The aspiring Arab gained the upper hand,
Again smote Rustam on the head and neck, |
And flung his warrior- body on the dust.
None in the two hosts were aware thereof,
Or whither those two paladins had gone, :
But searched until they found the scene of strife.
The fraénians, when they spied their paladin
Slashed by the scimitar from head to foot,
YAZDAGIRD 85

Filed. Many a chicftain perished in the press,

And many failed for thirst upon the saddle.

The world had had full measure of the Shahs.

The host fared to the monarch of Iran,

And hastened on the way both day and night.
When Rustam had been slain in fight, and when
The chiefs’ heads were all turned, the Muslim host
Sped like a savage lion in pursuit.?

At that time Yazdagird was at Baghdad ;

To him the troops came flocking and announced
That Rustam was no more, and that the sea

Was dry with gricf, that many men had fallen,
And that the rest had fled the battlefield.

The hosts, both Persian and Arabian,

Reached Karkh, and Farrukhzad, son of Hurniuzd,
Wroth and with tearful eyes came from the Arwand,
Arrived at Karkh, fell on the enemy,

And not an Arab warrior survived.

The Persians marched out from Baghdad intent
To meet the foe, and bloody was the event.

§ 5

How Yazdagird consulted with the [rdnians and went
to Khurdstin

When Farrukhzad had gone back to the Shah,
All over dust and in his fighting-gear,
He lighted from his charger, did obeisance,

1 The French version of the rest of this section is as follows :-—
“Yezdegird était & Bagdad lorsque ses troupes affluérent autour
de lui. Farrukhzad, fils d’Hormuzd, furieux et répandant des
larmes, traversa le Tigre, entra dans Kerkh et livra un assant
terrible qui ne lassa vivant aucun des guerriers armdés de lances.

86 THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

Blood in his eyes and anguish in his heart,
And said to Yazdagird : ‘* Why weep so much ?
Is it to wash the throne of kings with tears ?
Thou only of the royal race art left
To wear the crown and sit upon the throne.
One, with a hundred thousand enemies,
How canst thou battle when exposed to all ?
Betake thee to the forest of Narwan:
The folk will gather to thee there and thence,
Like valiant Faridtin, do thou renew
The fight like fire.”
The king of kings gave ear.
New thoughts occurred. Upon the morrow’s morn
He sat upon his throne, assumed the crown,
Held an assembly with his men of lore,
The magnates and shrewd-hearted, archimages,
And said: ‘‘ What secmeth good to you herein ?
What precedents recall ye from the past ?
Saith Farrukhzdd to me: ‘ Depart and take
Thy followers to the forest of Narwan :
The people of Amul, are servitors,
The people of Sari all slaves, to thee,
And, when thy troops are many, come again
With puissance to battle with the Brave.’
Do ye approve ?”
They all of them exclaimed :—

The king of kings rejoined :—
“It is not well. I purpose otherwise.
Shall I desert the chieftains of fran,
And this great host, our country, throne, and crown

| The Shah thus answered them :—
‘“ Anxiety is ruin to the heart.
Our best course is to go to Khurasan
Where we shall feel secure from strife with foes,
For there we are possessed of many troops,
And valiant paladins. The Turkish chiefs
And Khan of Chin will come and do us homage
While I will make the union stronger still
By marriage with the daughter of Faghfur.
A great host will arrive to succour us,
The magnates of Turan and mighty men.
There is the warden of the marches too,

Of all kinds. Je is our chicf governor, C, 2072
The highest of the guardians of our coasts.
I raised him when he was a vagabond,
A minstrel and a braggart, giving him,
Though worthless, name and worth, men, government,
Lands, elephants. Base though he be and vile
Still his advancement hath been at my court.
Now I have heard an archmage quote this saw :—
‘Of one whom thou hast wrongly harmed beware :
Of one made rich by thee thy hopes are fair.’ |

‘““O mighty, raging Lion!’ said the Shah,
“To make this trial will work me no hurt.”
He stayed that night and, when the morning broke,
Those noble men set forth and left Baghdad
For Khurdsan, and took their travail lightly.
The chieftains of Ivan all sorrowlul
Accompanied their Shah, that noble man,
And called down blessings on him, saying: “ May

Drew near to him with outcrics and in tears,
And said to him: ‘‘O Shah! we are thy slaves
With souls and bodies filled with love for thee.
We all will go with thee to learn how fortune
Will sport with our king’s life, for if we lose
Our Shah how can our hearts find joy in home,
And country ? We will quit our settlements,
Our children, and our wealth to share thy toils.
We care not for our lives without thy throne:

Then said he to the merchantmen of Chin :—
“Make no long tarrying here, else will the Arabs
Convert your quest of gain to loss.”

They parted
With pain and trouble, sorrow, care, and wailing.

All spearmen and in coats of mail, and when

The Glory of the royal state appeared,

The flag of majesty and such a host,

Alighted from his steed forthwith and. paid

His duty to the king of kings, walked softly

Upon the burning dust and from his eyes

Shed tears of reverence. Te kissed the ground,

Prolonging his obeisanee. All his troops

Acclaimed the Shah and touched earth with their

While Farrukhzad enranked his powers when he

Beheld the visage of Méhwi of Sur

God grant to him a place among the Just,

And give the swarthy Ravens to our spears !
Mahwi replied: ‘‘ O paladin! the Shah

Is eye and soul to me. I undertake

In thy place to defend thy king, thy Heaven.”
So Farrukhzdd, son of Hurmuzd, departed

To Rai as bidden by the Shah. The sky

Revolved awhile with matters in this stay,

And all love passed from that malignant’s brain,

And none dared go to battle with the Arabs

Because the azure sky was helping them ;

The visage of the monarch of Iran

Grew wrinkled; the foc’s deeds made strait his heart.

Méhwi saw that the Shah was at a stay,

And driven on by fortune helplessly,

Ambitioned. speedily the throne and changed

In policy, in manners, and dispose,

Then for a season he began to affect

Ill health and barely showed the Shah respect.

How Méhwt of Str incited Bizhan to war with Yar
dagird and how Yazdagird fled and hid himself
ina Mill

There was a paladin, a Turk by race,

A man of influence and named Bizhan ;

He dwelt within the coasts of Samarkand
Where he had many kin. Iil-starred Mahwi,
Becoming self-assertive, wrote to him :— .
‘Thou prosperous scion of the paladins! »
YAZDAGIRD 97

A strife hath risen that will bring thee profit :
The Shah is of all places here at Marv
And with no troops! His head and crown and state,
Wealth, throne, and host, are thine if thou wilt come.
Recall the vengeance owing to thy sires,
And give this unjust race its just reward.”
Bizhan, considering the Iectter, saw
That insolent Mahwi would win the world,
Then spake thus to his minister: “ Thou chief
Of upright men! what sayest thou to this ?
.If I lead forth a host to aid Mahwi
"Twill be my ruin here.’’?
The minister
Replied: “ O lion-hearted warrior !
"Twere shame to help Mahwi and then withdraw. C. 2079
Command Barsam to set forth with a host
To aid upon this scene of strife. The sage
Will term thee daft to go and fight in person
At the insistence of this man of Str.”
Bizhan replied: “ Tis well, I will not go
Myself.”
He therefore bade Barsdm to lead
Ten thousand valiant cavaliers and swordsmen
To Marv with all the implements of war
If haply he might take the Shah. That host
Went like a flying pheasant from Bukhara
To Marv within one week. One night at cock-crow
The sound of tymbals went up from the plain.
How could the king of kings suspect Mahwi
Of Sur to be his enemy ? Shouts rose.
A cavalier reached Yazdagird at dawn
To say: “ Méhwi saith thus: ‘ A host of Turks

The Shah wroth donned his mail. The armies

ranged.}

He formed his troops to right and left, and all

Advanced to battle. Spear in hand he held

The centre, and the whole world was bedimmed

With flying dust. He saw how lustily

The Turks engaged, unsheathed his sword, and came,

As *twere an elephant before his troops.

Earth Nile-wise flowed. Like thundering cloud he
charged,

But not a warrior supported him ;

All turned their backs upon that man of name,

And left him mid the horsemen of the foe.

The world’s king, when Mahwi withdrew, perceived

The practice hid till then-—the intent and plan

To capture him—yct played the man in fight,

Displaying valour, strength, and warriorship,

Slew many at the centre, but at length

Fled in despair, with falchion of Kébul

In hand, pursued by many Turks. He sped

Like lightning mid night’s gloom and spied a mill

On the canal of Zark?. Alighting there

The world’s king lay in hiding from his foes

Within the mill. The horsemen searched for him;

All Zark was hue and ery. The Shah abandoned

His gold-trapped steed, his mace, and scimitar

With golden sheath. The Turks with loud shouts
sought him,

Excited "by that steed and. equipage.

The Shah abode until the sun arose,

And then the miller oped the mill-house door.

He bore a truss of grass upon his back.

A low-born-man was he, by name Khusrau,

Poor, foolish, unrespected, purposcless.

He lived upon the profits of his null,

Which gave him full employment. He beheld

A. warrior, like a lofty eypress, sitting

In dolour on the ground with kingly crown

Upon his head and with brocade of Rim

Bright on his breast ; his eyes a stag’s, his chest

And neck a lion’s; of beholding him

The eye ne’er tired. He was unique in form;

Wore golden boots; his sleeves were fringed with
pearls

And gold. Khusrau looked, stood astound, and
called

On God, then said: ‘“‘O man of sunlike mien !

Say in what sort thou camest to this mill ?

Why didst thou take it for thy resting-place

Full as it is of wheat and dust and hay ?

Who art thou with such form, such Grace and looks ?

Sure, heaven never saw the like of thee!”
The Shah replied: “ I am frdnian-born,

In flight before the army of Turdn.”’, |

With some poor ercsses from the river-bank,
Will serve thee I will bring them; naught have |
Besides : a man so straitened well may wail.”
Through stress of fight the Shah had rested not,
Or eaten, for three days and so replied :—
** Bring what thou hast, that and the sacred twigs
Will serve my turn.”’
The poor and lowly miller
Brought him the ecresses and the barley-bread,
Made haste to fetch the sacred twigs and, reaching
The toll-house? on the way, crossed to the chief
Of Zark to make request for them. MdAhwi
Flad sent men on all sides to find the Shah,
And so the chieftain asked the miller: “ Friend !
For whom need’st thou the sacred twigs ?”
Khusrau
Replied: “ There is a warrior at the mill,
And seated on the hay, a cypress slim
In height, a sun in looks, a man of Grace,
With eyebrows arched and melancholy eyes :
His mouth is full of sighs, his soul is sad.
I sct stale fare before him-—barley-bread,
Such as I cat myself—but he is fain
To take the sacred twigs while muttering grace.?
Thou well mayst muse at him.”
The chief rejoined :—
‘Go and inform Maéhwi of Sur hereof,
For that foul miscreant must not reveal
His proper bent when he shall hear of this.’
Forthwith he charged a trusty man to take

Then anxious for himself; ‘‘ For whom didst thou

Require the sacred twigs ? Tell me the truth.”
The miller all a-tremble made reply :—

‘““T had been out to fetch a load and flung

The mill-door open roughly, when know this :

The sun was in mine eyes, but his are like

Those of a startled fawn; his locks are dark

As the third watch of night; his breath suggesteth

Musk, and his face embellisheth his crown.

One that hath never seen the Grace of God

Should take the mill-house key. His diadem

Is full of uncut jewels, and his breast

Bright with brocade of Rim. The mill hath grown

As ’twere a sun through him, and yet his food

Is barley-bread, his seat upon the hay !

By name Radwi, whose mind wore wisdom’s bridle,
Said to Mahwi: “O thou malignant one!
Why hath the Div confused thine eyes? This know :
The royal and prophctic offices
Are two gems set within one finger-ring.
To break one is to trample life and wisdom
Beneath thy f[cet. Reflect upon thy words,
And then forbear. Be not the Maker’s foc.
First will disaster come on thee hercfrom,
Then thou wilt leave a seed-plot for thy child,
With fruit of colocynth and leafage blood.
Ere long thou wilt behold thy head abased ;
Thy villainy will be exposed; thy sons
Will reap what thou hast sown. This decd of thine
Will wreck the Faith of God, and crown and throne
Will curse thee.”’
Then a devotee devout,
Who never put his hand forth to injustice,
By name Hurmuzd, son of Kharrad, a man
Who rested in the Faith, said to Mahwi :—
‘OQ thou oppressor! quit not thus the way
Of holy God. I see thy heart and sense
Bedimmed. We sce thy breast a tomb. Though
strong
Thou hast no brain; thy mind is weak; thou seckest
The smoke and not the fire. I see that thou
Wouldst have the malediction of the world,
And, when thou quit’st it, travail, smart, and anguish.
Now will thy lifetime prove a wretched onc,
And fire thy dwelling-place when thou departest.”
He sat. Shahrdn rose and. addressed Méhwi :—
“ Why this audacity ? Thou hast opposed

Have proved of no account vet men ne’er hasted

To slay them. Shed not, as thou art a slave,
The blood of Shahs because thou wilf be cursed

This he said, and sat down weeping
In anguish with heart full and eyes all gall.
Then Mihr- -i-Nush stood forth in deep distress,
With lamentation, and addressed Mahwi :—
‘“*O evil man of evil race, who art
Not well advised or just! a crocodile
Respecteth royal blood, a leopard finding
A slain king doth not rend him. O thou worse

Still in the end the avenger came to him.

From Nishirwan, the Shah, back to Ardshir,
While, seventh backward from Ardshir, Sasan,
The world-lord, had the crown,' for God entrusted
To him the Kaian crown, and all the kings
Were of that glorious race. Now many a man
Wath been thy bettcr, but they ne’er conecived
Designs like these. As for Bahram Chubina,
Three hundred thousand skilful cavalicrs

On barded steeds fled at one shaft of his,”

And left the field of fight to him; but when
His heart grew weary of the race of Shahs

The head of his resplendent fortune fell.

So Farayin, who sought the throne of kings
Unworthily and bathed his hands in blood,
Was in like manner miserably slain :

This age endureth not such mockeries.

Fear Him, the Lord, the Maker of the world,
For He created throne and crown and signet.
Defame not thine own person wantonly
Because ere long such things will rise against thee.
Know that whoever speaketh not the truth

To thee is thy soul’s foc. Now thou art sick
While I am as the leech, a lecch that wailcth,

And sheddeth drops of blood. Thou art thyself
Less than the slave of slaves. Be not ambitious
In thy heart’s thoughts. Leave strife to holy God,
And seek in honour’s way the throne of greatness.”’
The shepherd-born! had set his heart upon

The throne: the archimages’ rede was hard.
So hath it ever been; tis no new thing:
The flouts of fortune are past reckoning,
Fixalting to the sky above this one,
And making that vile, wretched, and undone,
Not leagued with that, on war with this not bent,
But void of wit, shame, Faith, and precedent.

The archmages all, till the world gloomed and moon
Suececded sun, warned that vindictive man,
Who was not one hair better for their talk,
And said when night came: “ Ye must leave me now
O sages! I will ponder this to-night,
And take all kinds of wisdom to my breast.
We will call twenty wise men from the host
That we may need not to deplore this ill.”

The prudent archimages went their ways,
The men of war arrived. Maéahwi held session
With his confederates? and said: “ What think ye
Herein ? If Yazdagird remain alive
Troops will collect to him from every side ;
My secret purposes have been exposed,
And all, both great and small, have heard thercof !
My life will end through his hostility,
And neither folk nor field and fell be left.”

A wise man said: “‘ Thou shouldest not have acted
At first so. If the monarch of fran |
Be ill-disposed toward thee then past, doubt
Ill will befall thee from him, yet ’tis ill

To shed his blood for then God will avenge him.

Mahwi’s son said to him: ‘‘ Well counselled sire !

Since thou hast made the Shah thine enemy

Be rid of him; troups from Machin and Chin

Will come to him and earth grow strait for us.

Hold this no trifle. Since thou hast prevailed

Tempt not the maws of lions. Thou and all

How Yasdagird was slain by Khusrau, the Miller

Thereat the shameless, infamous Mahwi
Turned fierecly to the miller, saying: “ Up!
Take cavalicrs and shed my foeman’s blood.”
The miller, hearing, knew not what to do,

But when at night the moon assumed her throne
Departed mill-ward to the Shah and when
He left the court-gate of Mahwi his eyes
Were charged with tcar-drops and his heart was full.
Forthwith Mahwi dispatched some cavalicrs
To follow swift as smoke, instructing them :—

“ See that ye sully not the crown and earrings,
The signet and the royal robes with blood,
And strip the Shéh when lifeless.”

All tearful and cheeks yellow.as the sun

With wetted cheeks and tongue all charged with dust,
He reached the Shah and drawing nigh with caution, —
As one would speak a secret in the ear,
Stabbed with a dirk his middle. At the blow
The Shah cried: “Ah!” Then tumbled head and
crown,

And barley-bread before him, to the dust !
Fle that abideth when he might depart
From this world hath no wisdom in his heart,
And wisdom is not in the turning sky,
Whose love is as its stress and enmity.
"Tis well to look not on the world and so
From these its doings love and wrath not know.
The planets weary of their fosterlings,

And guiltless folk like Yazdagird are slain ;
None else hath perished thus of all the kings,

Nor of his host a plier of the rein.
The horsemen of accursed Mahwi, on sccing
That royal Tree thus laid to rest afar
From palace and his seencs of ease, drew near,
Gazed, one and all, upon his face, removed
His cincture,violet robe, and coronet,
His torque and golden boots, and left him there
In miserable case upon the ground—
The monarch of Iran flung on the dust,
Blood-boltered, with gashed side! Those cmissarics,
When they arose, all framed their tongues to curse :-—
“ Oh! may Mahwi himself fare, prostrate thus,

All gory on earth’s face.” _
They told Mahwi :—
"The exalted. Shah hath passed away from throne,

From battle and delights,”’ and he commanded
To take, when it was night, the monarch’s corpse,
And, fling it in the stream. The miller took

‘The body of the Shah forth from the mill,

And flung it (mark the horror !) in the water,
And there it floated with a bobbing head !*
When it was day and people went abroad
Two men of worship visited the spot.
One of these men austcre and sober reached
The river-bank and, when he saw the corpse
All naked in the water, hurried back
In consternation to the monastcry,
And told the other monks what he had seen :—
‘The Shah, the master of the world, is drowned,
And naked in the water-way of Zark !”’
Then many of those holy men—the chief
And others of all ranks—set forth. A ery
Of anguish rose from them: ‘ O noble man, C. 2084
And royal crown-possessor ! none ¢’er saw
The wearer of it in such plight as this,
Or ever heard before the time of Christ
A case like this king’s through his wicked slave,
This misbegotten dog, this reprobate,
Who fawned upon his master till ill came ;
Mahwi’s just portion is to be accursed.
Woe for the head and crown, the height and micn !
Woe for the breast and arms, the hands and macc!
Woe for the last descendant of Ardshir !
Woe for that cavalier so young and goodly !
Strong wast thou; thou hadst wisdom in thy soul,
And thou hast gone to bear the news hereof
To Nushirwan that, though thy face was moonlike,
And though thou wast a king and soughtest crowns,
Yet in the mill they pierced thy liverstead,
And flung thy naked body in the stream ! ’?

Within the garth a charnel-house and raised
Its summit to the clouds. They sealed his wound
With gum, with pitch, with camphor, and with musk,
And then arrayed him in brocade of gold,
With fine Egyptian linen underneath,
And dark-blue Russian cloth o’er all. They decked
His place of rest with wine and gum and camphor,
With musk and with rose-water.

Upon the point, could make me no reply,
Or if he spake ’twould be in words involved
That keep the answer still a mystery.
If thou hast means, good man! indulge thy heart ;
Trust not to what the morrow promiseth,
Because the world and thou perforce must part,
And time accounteth for thine every breath;
Thou shouldest sow not any save good seed
In what remaineth of thy mortal strife ;
Control the door of appetite and greed ;
He that provided will provide through life,
And life itself will but produce for thee
Fair fame and happiness, good friend! Then still
With all thy might eschew iniquity,
For from a wise man should proceed no ill.
Bring wine; our day is nearly o’er and hence
We must away, for what hath been will be.
Had I incomings balancing expense
Then time would be a brother unto me.

Though death itself were better than the hail,
And heaven’s lofty, far-extending dome

How Méhwi of Stir was informed of the Obsequies? of
Yazdagird and ascended the Throne

One came and told Mahwi of Sir: “ The world-lord
Is hidden in the dust. The prelates, priests,

And monks of Rim—all those of life austere,
Both young and old, throughout that march and
land—
Went wailing, took his body from the stream,
And made for him within the garth a charne]—
A great one, higher than the mountain-slopes.’”!
Mahwi, that luckless wretch, exclaimed: “ fran
Had ne’er before affinity with Rum.”
He sent and slew the builders of that charnel,
With those that mourned, and gave that march to
spoil,
Such was his will and worth! Thereafter he
Made search throughout the world and found not one
Of that great stock. He had a crown and signet,
The Shah’s erewhile, and to that shepherd-born
The throne appealed. He called his intimates,
Announced the purpose that he had at heart,
And told his minister: ‘ Experienced man !
The day of strife and battle is upon us.
I have no treasure, fame or lineage,
And may but give my head up to the winds.
The name that is upon my signet-ring
Is Yazdagird: my scimitar hath failed
To make men yield to me. Throughout fran
Men are his slaves although his kin is scattered.
The sages do not hail me as the Shah,
The soldiers do not recognise my scal.
My machinations tended otherwise.
Oh! wherefore did I shed the world-king’s blood ?
All night am I sore-troubled in my thoughts :
The World-lord knoweth how it is with me.”

And set thy tongue to words of pleasantness.
Say thus: ‘ The Shah gave me the crown and signet
As emblems of authority, perceiving
The coming of an army from the Turks,
Called me at dead of night, and said: ‘‘ When bruit
Of war ariseth who can say which side
The dust will be, so take this crown and ring,
For they may help thee on the day of battle.
I have one daughter only left to mc:
In truth she is in hiding from the Arabs.
Hereafter yield not to the foe my throne,
And by these tokens walk thou in my steps.”’
I have then from the Shah as legacy
This crown and in accord to his behest

Give thou thine acts a gloss for who will know
The truth from falsehood ? ”
** Good !”’ exclaimed Mahwi,
“Thou art a minister—a peerless one !”’
He summoned all the captains of the host,
And spake at large to them to that effect.
They knew: “It is not true, and well it were
To cut his head off for his shamelessness.”’
A paladin observed: “ ’Tis thy concern
If what thou sayest be the truth or not.”
He heard and sat him down upon the throne,
By his deceit gat hold of Khurdasan,
Distributed the earth among his chiefs,
And said: ‘Iam the world’s king with the signet.’
He called his kin and said the same at large ;
_ He took the whole earth as it were a gift ;

And sent troops to each quarter. As his host

And put them in good case; he filled the heads
Of his own kith and kin with vapourings.

Then with his troops and valiant warriors,
Preceded by the scouts and Garsiyin—

A veteran chief—they marched upon Bukhara,
Intent on war, for ‘‘ Chach and Samarkand

To him a force of haughty cavaliers

In quest of fame, for he had said: * If thou

Wilt send me troops I will dispatch to thee

By privy pact the crown of king of kings

With golden throne and signet. In the world

The sovereignty is fitly thine.’ Thy troops

Went hence in haste and found the Shah at Marv.

They compassed him about. The Iranians fled.

When that wise king was left alone he feared

That ill might come upon him from the host.

There was a certain mill upon the ford,

And thither went the Shah, a sun in Grace.

Mahwi of Stir heard of him, sent and slew him,

And through the royal signet gained the world

When he had slain his master. Now the more part

Of praise and blame in this affair is thine,

Thine were the valiant horsemen and the strife.”
Barsam said thus: “O king! what time? I took

A mounted foree from Chach? Mahwi had said

To thee: ‘The golden throne of Yazdagird,

Elis armlets set with gems, his crown withal

And treasure, will I send to Balkh. The throne

And crown within the world must necds be thine.’

I fought three days at Marv. When on the fourth

The world’s light shone I battled furiously,

For I was pressed. Tyrannical Mahwi

Displayed his back. The Iranian king of kings,

Abandoned, like a furious lion charged

My troops and slaughtered many of my chiefs,

But, when he had no comrades left, he too

Displayed his back; but how that master-slayer,

And privily, his lord, so great a king,

No Turk encountered and escaped his mace :
He broke our nobles’ hearts. I have not seen

furnished
Seized on the realm in this unholy wise.
Now that the foe in arms invadcth thee
Thou and thine army must be up and doing.
Let not weeds blossom in the royal garden
Or it will be forgotten.”
Hearing this,
Bizhan raged much at having helped to dim
The fortune of the Shah, then bade assemble
His host of Turks, his horsemen of the day
Of battle, sped forth from Kachar Bashi,
And lost no time upon the road. Whenas
He drew anear Bukhara all the waste
Was covered with his troops to whom he said :-—
“ Haste not and let Mahwi be first to lead
His host across the water! to contend
With me. Perchance on him I may avenge
The Shah.”
He asked thereafter: ‘‘ Did the —s
Leave no availful child ? Had he no brother ?
In the default of sons had he no daughter,
Whom we might carry with us and assist,
And take full satisfaction of Mahwi ?”
Barsdm replied: ‘‘My lord! this race’s day

No Shah is left or worshipper of Fire.”

Bizhan, on hearing this, resumed his march,
Astound at this world’s doings. Scouts announced :—
“ A host hath come and campeth at Baigand.

They crossed in boats, their dust obscured the sun.”

Bizhan, the chicf, led on his troops to war,

And when Mahwi of Sur beheld them thou

Hadst said: ‘‘ His soul took flight.” He was in
dudgeon

At all those breastplates, helmets, shields of Chin,

At all those maces, spears, and battle-axes

Bizhan, when he had drawn up his array,

Prepared an ambush for the Iranians ;

Mahwi knew of it and with loud exclaims

Departed from among his troops. Bizhan

Looked forth, beheld the flag, and knew: ‘“‘ Mdhwi

Is minded to take flight,’ and bade Barsdm :-—

“ Lead from the central host what troops thou hast,

And draw toward one side; we must not let |

M4hwi decline the battle and haste thus

Jihtin-wards. Speed and keep him well in sight,

For we must deal with him in other wise.”
Barsam of Chin observed the flag and drew

His troops apart until with frowning face,

And malisons upon his lips, he reached ___
The desert of Farab, there found Méhwi, |

And, with his weight upon the stirrups, charged ;
Then, closing face to face, he plicd his sword,
Displaying valour, scized his foeman’s belt,
Unseated him and dashed him to the ground,
Alighted, bound his hands, and then remounting
Drove him along in front. With that came up
Barsdm’s own comrades, and the bruit of him
Filled all the plain. They said: ‘ O chief! Mahwi
Should be beheaded on the way.”

He answered :—
“Not so; Bizhan as yet is not informed
About the capture.”’

Presently Bizhan

Gat news: “ That ill-conditioned slave is taken,”
Heard and grew glad of heart. He hugged himself,
And thus released from care roared lion-like.
Then many valiant Turks caine and discussed
The fashion of the slaying of Mahwi.
All that they recognised as of his court
They put to death—a countless multitude.
They looted all the baggage and dragged off
Méhwi stripped bare of all. The guilty wretch
Lost all his wits when he beheld Bizhan,
Was as a soulless body with affright, C. 2094
And strewed upon his head the unstable sand.
Bizhan said: ‘“‘ O thou miscreant ! may none have
A slave like thee! Why didst thou put to death
That righteous Shah, the lord of victory
And throne, and by ancestral right both Shah
And king, the memory of Nushfrwan ?”
Mahwi made answer thus: ‘‘ The evil-doer
Can look for naught but slaying and reproach.
Now smite my neck for wrong done and fling down
‘My head in presence of this company.” |

‘That I shall banish vengeance from my heart,” |

Struck off MAhwi’s hand with the scimitar,
And said: “ This hand hath not a peer in crime.”

The hand thus lopped, he said: “ Cut off his fect
That he may not escape,” and further bade :—
Cut off his nose and ears, let hin be placed
Upon a horse out on the burning sand
Until he sleepeth in his shame.”

They bound him

From head to foot with cords, the clarions sounded,
A. herald went the circuit of the host,
And, as he passed the entry of the tents, '
Made proclamation: ‘ Slaves that slay your masters !
Indulge no foolish thoughts, and may all those

Be as Mahwi and never see the throne.”

There was a prince, by name Guraz, at once
The glory and the pleasure of Mahwi.
He was the governor of Marv what time
M4hwi died wretchedly. As eldest son
He was his father’s lustre, who had made
A crown of gold for him. When fortune loured
Upon Mé4hwi the horsemen rode to Marv
From all sides. Tumult spread. The war-cry rose,
And strife and turmoil filled the land. Guraz
Was slain mid those dark doings, and the day
Of all his race was done. He had three sons
Among his troops, three favourite sons possessed
Of crown and throne. A lofty pyre was kindled,
And he and his three sons were burned thereon.
None of the seed remained or if some did
Men harried them. The chieftains cursed that race,
All vengeful for the slaughter of the Shah :-—
‘May it be cursed and may there never fail
A man to curse it as it hath deserved.”

Account of the Completion of the Shadhnama

When five and sixty years had passed me by
I viewed my task with more anxicty,

And as my yearning to achieve it grew

My fortune’s star receded from my view.
Persians well read and men of high degree
Wrote all my work out and would take no fee.
I over-looked from far, and thou hadst said
That they had rather handselled me instead !
Naught but their praises had I for my part,
And while they praised I had a broken heart.
The mouths of their old money-bags were tied,
Whereat mine ardent heart was mortified.

Of famous nobles of this town ’Ali,

The Dilamite,t most shared the work with me,
For he, a man of ardent temper made,
Through kindliness of soul forwent no aid.
Husain, son of Kutib, a Persian lord,

Asked me for naught without its due reward,
But furnished gold and silver, clothes and meat,
And found me ways and means, and wings and feet,
As for taxation, naught thereof know I;

122 “ THE SHAHNAMA OF FIRDAUSI

What time my years attained to ten times seven
And one my poetry surmounted heaven.

For five and thirty years I bore much pain
Here in this Wayside Inn in quest of gain,

But all the five and thirty years thus past
Naught helped; they gave my travail to the blast,
And my hopes too have gone for evermore

Now that mine age all but hath reached fourscore.
I end the story of Shah Yazdagird,

And in Sapandarmad, the day of Ard,

And year four hundred of Muhammad’s Flight,
The last words of this royal book I write.

For ever flourishing be Shah Mahmud,

His head still green, his heart with joy imbued.
I have so lauded him that publicly

And privily my words will never die.

Of praises from the Great I had much store ;
The praises that I give to him are more.

May he, the man of wisdom, live for aye,

His doings turn to his content alway.

This tale of sixty thousand couplets I

Have left to him by way of memory.

My life from days of youth to eld hath sped

In talk and hearkening what others said.

When this, my famous tale, was done at last
O’er all the realm my reputation past.

All men of prudence, rede, and Faith will give
Applause to me when I have ceased to live,

Yet live I shall; the seed of words have I

Flung broad-cast and henceforth I shall not dic.

The Shdhnéma of Firdaust is ended.
