<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>

<p><persName>Kai Kubad</persName> ascends the throne, and defeats the <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs>. <persName>Rustam</persName> in this his first campaign greatly distinguishes himself, and nearly takes <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> prisoner. <persName>Pashang</persName>, the father of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> and ruler of <placeName>Turan</placeName>, sues for peace and terms are arranged. <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> rewards <persName>Zal</persName>, <persName>Rustam</persName>, and others for their services, and makes <placeName>Istakhr</placeName> his capital. At the end of a long and glorious reign he dies after appointing his son <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> as his successor.</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p><persName>Kai Kubad</persName> is mentioned at least twice in the Zandavasta, where he appears under the name of Kavata, or Kavi Kavata, and the name of his son <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> appears both there and in the Vedas, We have no accounts of <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>’s ancestry in the poem beyond the vague statement that he was descended from <persName>Faridun</persName>.<ref target="n.11.1"/> He is described indeed as being brought by <persName>Rustam</persName> from Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName>—the great mythical range which was supposed to encircle the earth. According to the Bundahish, <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>, like <persName>Darab</persName> after him, was exposed at birth and was found and adopted by <persName>Zav</persName>, the son of <persName>Tahmasp</persName>, the ninth Shah.<ref target="n.11.2"/> The same authority describes him as reigning for fifteen years.<ref target="n.11.3"/></p>

<head>How <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> ascended the Throne and warred against <placeName>Turan</placeName></head>
<p>


<lb/>When <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> acceded to the throne,
<lb/>and donned the jewelled crown, chiefs such as <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>karan the warrior, <persName>Kishwad</persName>, <persName>Kharrad</persName>,

<note xml:id="n.11.1">For <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>’s genealogy, see ZT, i. 407.</note>

<lb/>and valorous <persName>Barzin</persName>, flocked round and scattered
<lb/>gems over that new crown. They said: <q>O Shah
<lb/>prepare to fight the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>he went, reviewed his host, and on the morrow
<lb/>marched forth while shouts rose from his tent-enclosure.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> armed and like an angry elephant
<lb/>sent up the dust, the troops arrayed their ranks,
<lb/>and girt their loins for bloodshed. On one wing
<lb/><persName>Mihrab</persName> the master of <placeName>Kabul</placeName> was stationed,
<lb/>upon the other doughty <persName>Gustaham</persName>.
<lb/><persName>Karan</persName> the warrior was in the centre
<lb/>with bold <persName>Kishwad</persName> the <sic>shatterer</sic> of hosts,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.299"/>

<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> led the van with chiefs and heroes,
<lb/>and <persName>Zal</persName> and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> as their supports.
<lb/>Here there was fire, there storm, while <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard
<lb/>amid the van made earth red, violet,
<lb/>and yellow, and the seated world was like
<lb/>a wave-tossed barque upon the sea of <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>The deserts and the dales were carpeted
<lb/>by shields on shields, the <sic>falchions</sic> gleamed like lamps,
<lb/>and all the world became a sea of pitch
<lb/>whereon a hundred thousand tapers burned.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The sun hath lost its way
<lb/>frayed by the trumpets' blare and warriors' shouts!</q>
<lb/>The hosts encountered, none knew van from rear.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.300"/>
<lb/><persName>Karan</persName> o’<sic>erthrew</sic> ten warriors at each charge;
<lb/>now wheeling to the left, now to the right,
<lb/>and seeking to wreak vengeance on all sides,
<lb/>he made earth mountain-like with slain, astounding
<lb/>the bravest <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>. Seeing <persName>Shamasas</persName>,
<lb/>who raised the war-cry lion-like, he charged,
<lb/>unsheathed his sword, smote his foe’s head, and shouted :—

<lb/><q>The famed <persName>Karan</persName> am I,</q> while <persName>Shamasas</persName>



<pb n="13"/>

<lb/>sank to the ground and perished in a breath.
<lb/>The manner of this ancient sky is so,
<lb/>at whiles like arrow and at whiles like bow!

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> fought with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> saw the doings of <persName>Karan</persName>,
<lb/>and what war is, he went to <persName>Zal</persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>Tell me, O paladin of paladins !

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.301"/>
<lb/>Where doth malevolent <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> 
<lb/>stand in the fight? Describe his garb and banner.
<lb/>I see a fluttering flag of violet.
<lb/>Describe him that I may encounter him,
<lb/>and so exalt my head among the chieftains.
<lb/>To-day will I lay hold upon his girdle
<lb/>and bring him hither <sic>haled</sic> upon his face.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> answered: <q> Hearken unto me, my son!
<lb/>And run no risks to-day. He is a <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>,
<lb/>whose breath is fire—a Cloud of bale in war.<ref target="n.13.1"/>
<lb/>his flag and mail are black, his helm and <sic>brassards</sic>
<lb/>of iron flecked with gold, his plume is sable.
<lb/>Avoid him, he is brave, his fortune sleepless.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><q> Be not concerned for me,</q> was <persName>Rustam</persName>’s answer.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.302"/>
<lb/><q> With God mine aid, heart, sword, and arm my ramparts, 
<lb/>although he be a <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs> and a div
<lb/>yet will I bring him by the belt, and thou
<lb/>shalt see me make him lifeless in the <sic>mellay</sic>,
<lb/>so dealing that <persName>Pashang</persName>’s troops shall bewail him.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>That lion-youth—the shelter of the host—
<lb/>urged on his steed—<rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> of the brazen hoofs—
<lb/>and shouting mid the trumpet-blare approached
<lb/>the army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>beheld amazed the lad not fully grown
<lb/>and asked: <q>Who is he, for I know him not—

<note xml:id="n.13.1">Cf. p. 53.</note>

<pb n="14"/>

<lb/>yon <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs> broken loose in such a fashion ?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>One said: <q>The son of <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName>.
<lb/>Dost thou not see him with his grandsire’s mace ?
<lb/>He is a youth and eager for distinction.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then like a vessel lifted by the waves
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> came forth while <persName>Rustam</persName> clipped
<lb/><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> firmly, shouldering his massive mace,
<lb/>but hung it to his saddle when he closed ;
<lb/>then, having caught the monarch by the belt,
<lb/>and dragged him from his poplar saddle, hoped
<lb/>to carry him to <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> to tell
<lb/>the story of this first day’s fight; but through
<lb/>the chieftain’s weight and <persName>Rustam</persName>’s grasp the girdle
<lb/>snapped, and the king came headlong to the ground,
<lb/>whereat his cavaliers surrounded him,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.303"/>

<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName>, when the chief escaped his clutch,
<lb/>gnawed at his hand’s back in chagrin and cried :—
<lb/><q>Why did I take him not beneath the armpit
<lb/>and simply make him <sic>handfast</sic> with his girdle?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>While from the elephants' backs the sound of bells
<lb/>rose, and the drums were heard for miles, men brought
<lb/>the Shah glad tidings: <q> <persName>Rustam</persName>,</q> they reported,
<lb/><q> Brake through the centre of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host
<lb/>and reached their general whose standard now
<lb/>hath disappeared, for <persName>Rustam</persName> seized his girdle
<lb/>and flung him easily. The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> yelled,
<lb/>the valiant chiefs formed round their fallen king,
<lb/>and bare him off. When vanquished thus he mounted
<lb/>a fleet steed, fled toward the plain, and left
<lb/>his host to save his life.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>At this good news

<lb/>the Shah gave orders to his troops to fall
<lb/>in mass like wind upon the enemy
<lb/>and utterly o’<sic>erthrow</sic> them, fruit and root.
<lb/>He rose himself like fire, and all his host
<lb/>heaved like a stormy sea. <persName>Zal</persName> and <persName>Mihrab</persName>,

<pb n="15"/>

<lb/>the Lion, went forth keen and valorous;
<lb/>the din of battle rose with <sic>falchion</sic>-flash


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.304"/>
<lb/>and thud of shaft, while heads grew dazed as axes 
<lb/>crashed on gold helm-and shield. Thou wouldst have said :—

<lb/><q> A cloud <sic>somewhence</sic> hath risen and is <sic>flecking</sic>
<lb/>yon oranges with magic cinnabar !</q>
<lb/>Upon that day of battle sank and rose
<lb/>blood to the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Fish</rs> and dust-clouds to the Moon,
<lb/>while through the horse-hoofs on that spacious plain
<lb/>one earth flew up to make another heaven !<ref target="n.15.1"/>
<lb/>heroic <persName>Rustam</persName> in the fight that day
<lb/>with dirk and lasso, mace and scimitar,
<lb/>Clave into pieces, rent and brake and bound
<lb/>the heads, breasts, feet, and hands of warriors,
<lb/>for eight and fifty score of gallant chiefs
<lb/>that Lion slaughtered in a single charge.
<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> gazing on his son illustrious
<lb/>in <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and might felt his heart throb with joy

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.305"/>
<lb/>to see such prowess, while the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> pressed 
<lb/>thus by the Magian host sought <placeName>Damaghan</placeName>,
<lb/>and thence fled toward <placeName>Jihun</placeName> with stricken hearts,
<lb/>with din and dudgeon, with their weapons broken
<lb/>and girdles snapped—a <sic>trumpless</sic>, <sic>drumless</sic> mob.

</p><p>

<lb/>The paladins that led the Iranian host
<lb/>turned from pursuing and drew near the Shah,
<lb/>all plunder-wearied, bringing band on band
<lb/>of captive <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>. When the troops were back
<lb/>in camp again the mighty men approached
<lb/>the monarch of the world, extolling him,
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> also went before the Shah,
<lb/>who seated him on one side of the throne
<lb/>and famous <persName>Zal</persName> upon the other one.

<head>How <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> came to his Father</head>
<p>

<lb/>Upon the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> side <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>fled to the river-bank and <sic>tarried</sic> there

<lb/>for seven days, made ready on the eighth,

<lb/>and gat him to his sire, all rage and grief;

<lb/>his tongue was long although his hands were shortened.
<lb/><q>O famous king!</q> said he, <q>the fault was thine
<lb/>in seeking war; the mighty men of old

<lb/>gave kings no precedent for breach of faith.

<lb/>The offspring of <persName>Iraj</persName> <sic>polluteth</sic> still

<lb/>the earth; that poison <sic>gnaweth</sic> yet; they come
<lb/>without a break to lord it o’er the world.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.306"/>
<lb/>Now 'tis <persName>Kubad</persName>; he hath assumed the crown

<lb/>and flung the gates of vengeance wide again.

<lb/>A cavalier of Sim’s seed hath appeared,

<lb/>by <persName>Zal</persName> named <persName>Rustam</persName>. Like a crocodile
<lb/>enraged he charged, and thou hadst said: <q> His breath
<lb/>will burn the world.</q> He sped o’er hill and dale,
<lb/>and plied mace, sword, and stirrup. All the air
<lb/>rang with his crashing mace. Life was not worth
<lb/>a pinch of dust tome. He overthrew

<lb/>our host; none ever saw a sight so strange!

<lb/>He spied my flag, put down his massive mace,
<lb/>and snatched me from my poplar saddle so

<lb/>that thou hadst said I was not one gnat’s weight !
<lb/>My girdle and my hauberk’s fastening snapped,

<lb/>I tumbled from his grasp beneath his feet.

<lb/>No lion hath such strength, his feet touch earth,
<lb/>his head is in the clouds. My cavaliers

<lb/>came up and saved me from that Mountain’s clutches.
<lb/>Thou know’st how kingly are my heart and hand,
<lb/>my prowess, deeds, and enterprise, yet I

<lb/>am but a fibre in his grasp. Such worship

<pb n="17"/>

<lb/>Perturbeth me. I saw a monstrous form

<lb/>with lion’s claws. My wits and senses fled.

<lb/>Hill, cave, and level road were one to him

<lb/>when his mad Elephant was put to speed.

<lb/>A thousand <sic>maces</sic> in good sooth and more

<lb/>fell on his famous helm: thou wouldst have said :—

<lb/><q>They fashioned him of iron, brought him up


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.307"/>
<lb/>on stones and brass!</q> What is a sea or mountain, 

<lb/>fierce lion or mad elephant to him ?

<lb/>He <sic>pricketn</sic> forth as on a hunting-day,

<lb/>and battle is his pastime. Had such might

<lb/>been <persName>Sam</persName>’s no <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> chief would now survive.

<lb/>We can but sue for peace, because thy troops

<lb/>give way before him. I, an <sic>atheling</sic>,

<lb/>thine army’s stay and thine own help in need,

<lb/>have no strength left to fight with him. Go to,

<lb/>take counsel and make peace. They gave the land,

<lb/>assigned of old by <persName>Faridun</persName> to <persName>Tur</persName>,

<lb/>to me; and that apportionment was just.

<lb/>Revive not ancient feuds for, if we pass

<lb/>the boundary and prosecute the war,

<lb/>we shall but make the world strait to ourselves.

<lb/>Thou know’st that sight is better than report,

<lb/>for hearsay’s belly is an empty one.

<lb/>To fight <placeName>Iran</placeName> appeared a jest to thee,

<lb/>the soldiers think that it hath gone too far.

<lb/>Defer not to to-morrow this day’s work ;

<lb/>who <sic>knoweth</sic> what to-morrow may bring forth ?

<lb/>The roses blooming in the garden now

<lb/>to-morrow thou wouldst pluck—when they are worthless !

<lb/><rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs> what a wealth of golden <sic>equipage</sic>,

<lb/>of golden helmets and of golden shields,

<lb/>how many <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steeds with golden bits,

<lb/>and, over and above these, what famed chieftains
<lb/>the blast hath vilely borne away—-Kulbdd,

<lb/>and bold <persName>Bahman</persName> who hunted lions only,

<lb/>and <persName>Kharzarwan</persName>, whom <persName>Zal</persName> hath dashed to pieces

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.308"/>
<lb/>fierce <persName>Shamasas</persName>—the shelter of the host—

<lb/>slain by <persName>Karan</persName> upon the battlefield,

<lb/>and, in addition to these famous men,

<lb/>ten thousand others slaughtered in this war;
<lb/>worse still, observe the breach of fame and honour
<lb/>that we can never bind. Though I have slain
<lb/>one famous chief—illustrious <persName>Ighriras</persName>—

<lb/>let fortune’s good and ill cry quits to-day,

<lb/>and leave to-morrow for the reckoning ;

<lb/>because the haughty chiefs have come to me,
<lb/>the heroes, each one with his flag behind him,
<lb/>and told me much that happened when I fled

<lb/>in dudgeon and they followed. Now revive not

<lb/>was all <sic>astonied</sic> at <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.309"/>
<lb/>that he should have bethought him of such words,
<lb/>and that his soul had turned to what was just.

<lb/>He chose a prudent envoy for <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<pb n="19"/>

<lb/>and wrote a letter worthy of the Artang,<ref target="n.19.1"/>

<lb/>decked with a hundred colours and designs :—

<lb/><q>In the name of Him who <sic>ruleth</sic> sun and moon,

<lb/>and gave to us the faculty of praise!

<lb/>May He accept the soul of <persName>Faridun</persName>,.

<lb/>From whom our race <sic>deriveth</sic>, warp and woof.

<lb/>Hear now, O famous <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>! and I

<lb/>will utter words of kingly <sic>rede</sic> and right.

<lb/><persName>Tur</persName> brought calamity on blest <persName>Iraj</persName>

<lb/>upon a question touching crown and throne.

<lb/>On this I say that feuds should not endure

<lb/>for ever, and if vengeance for <persName>Iraj</persName>

<lb/>was owing it was wreaked by <persName>Minuchihr</persName>.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.310"/>
<lb/>In that first settlement by <persName>Faridun</persName>, 
<lb/>whose object was a just apportionment,

<lb/>it will be well for us to acquiesce

<lb/>and not transgress the precedents of kings.
<lb/>From <placeName>Turkestan</placeName> to Ma <sic>wara</sic> 'u'n-Nahr,
<lb/>whose boundary is <placeName>Jihun</placeName>, that is our share,
<lb/>when <persName>Faridun</persName> was Shah <persName>Iraj</persName> ne’er saw it,
<lb/>but had from him his blessing and <placeName>Iran</placeName>.

<lb/>If we transgress these boundaries and fight
<lb/>we make earth strait to us, the <sic>scimitars</sic>
<lb/>will clash, God will be <sic>wroth</sic>, and we shall lose
<lb/>our portion in both worlds. What <persName>Faridun</persName>
<lb/>divided unto <persName>Salm</persName>, <persName>Tur</persName>, and <persName>Iraj</persName>,

<lb/>let us retain and then be friends henceforth,
<lb/>for earth itself is worth not so much bale.
<lb/>The reverend head of <persName>Zal</persName> hath grown like snow,
<lb/>the dust is crimson with our warriors' blood,
<lb/>and yet a man will only own at last

<lb/>his body’s length of all that he <sic>possesseth</sic> !

<lb/>we with a shroud for robe, a grave for home,
<lb/>shall own but some five <sic>cubits</sic>' length of earth ;
<lb/>all other wishes are but care and toil—

<lb/>If <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> doth acquiesce in this,
<lb/>and if that sage’s head <sic>ensueth</sic> right,
<lb/>not one of us shall dream of the <placeName>Jihun</placeName>,
<lb/>but let the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> keep to their own side.
<lb/>It may be that good will and intercourse

<lb/>He sealed and sent this to the Iranian host
<lb/>with jewels, crowns, gold thrones, fair damsels girt

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.311"/>
<lb/>with gold, Arabian steeds with golden trappings,
<lb/>and Indian swords in <sic>silvern</sic> sheaths besides
<lb/>the <sic>goodliest</sic> native wares. The envoy reached
<lb/>Kubdd and gave the letter and the message.
<lb/>The king of kings read and replied at large :—
<lb/><q>We did not recommence; this war was caused
<lb/>directly by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>. The wrong
<lb/>began with <persName>Tur</persName> when he bereaved a prince
<lb/>such as <persName>Iraj</persName> was of the throne, and now
<lb/>it is <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> that <sic>crosseth</sic> over
<lb/>the river to invade us. Thou hast heard
<lb/>his treatment of <persName>Naudar</persName>, which filled wild beasts
<lb/>with grief and pain, while on wise <persName>Ighriras</persName>
<lb/>he did a deed unworthy of a man,
<lb/>yet if ye do repent I will renew
<lb/>the compact, though I well could take revenge,
<lb/>armed as I am for all emergencies,
<lb/>thus leaving you the lands beyond the river,
<lb/>and then perchance <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will rest.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The Shah drew up the treaty and thus planted
<lb/>a fresh tree in the garden of his greatness.
<lb/>The envoy went and brought with leopard’s speed
<lb/>the letter to <persName>Pashang</persName>, who packed his baggage,
<lb/>marched back, and sent the dust-clouds heavenward.

<pb n="21"/>

<lb/>he crossed <placeName>Jihun</placeName> like wind, and news thereof
<lb/>reached <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>, who <sic>joyed</sic> because the foe
<lb/>withdrew without a fight, but <persName>Rustam</persName> said :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.312"/>
<lb/><q>Look not, O Shah! for peace in time of war. 
<lb/>Of old we ne’er had rest from their assaults ;
<lb/>my mace it was that made them thus to-day.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Thus to that noble chief spake <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> :—
<lb/><q> Naught have I seen more goodly than the right.
<lb/><persName>Pashang</persName>, a scion of blest <persName>Faridun</persName>,
<lb/>Avoideth strife for he hath had enough,
<lb/>and men of wisdom must not look upon him
<lb/>askance and with injustice. I will draw’
<lb/>a deed of gift on silk for thee of all
<lb/>between the <placeName>Indus</placeName> and <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>.
<lb/>Go take the throne and crown too of <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>,
<lb/>and lighten all the world. Upon this side
<lb/>give to <persName>Mihrab</persName> <placeName>Kabul</placeName>, and keep thy <sic>spearpoints</sic>
<lb/>sharp, for where’er a king is there is war
<lb/>though earth is broad enough.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah prepared

<lb/>gifts both for <persName>Rustam</persName> and for <persName>Zal</persName> whose head
<lb/>he crowned, whose loins he girt, with gold, and gave
<lb/>half of the world to him. He kissed the ground.
<lb/><persName>Kubad</persName> the fortune-favoured further said :—
<lb/><q> Ne’er may the throne of majesty lack <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>one hair of whom <sic>outweigheth</sic> all the world;
<lb/>he is the heirloom left us by the great.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>They furnished forth five elephants with litters
<lb/>inlaid with turquoise brighter than <placeName>Nile</placeName>-water,
<lb/>and spread upon the litters cloth of gold,
<lb/>besides <sic>unreckoned</sic> wealth, a royal robe
<lb/>of gold, a crown and girdle wrought of jewels
<lb/>and turquoise, all of which he sent to <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>I fain had sent a greater gift,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.313"/>
<lb/>and, should long life be mine, I will not leave 
<lb/>a wish of thine unsatisfied on earth.</q>

<pb n="22"/>

<lb/>moreover on K.iran the warrior,
<lb/>upon <persName>Kishwid</persName>, <persName>Kharrad</persName>, <persName>Barzin</persName>, <persName>Pulad</persName>,
<lb/>he showered robes of honour as was fit,
<lb/>and to the rest that seemed to him deserving
<lb/>gave money, shields, and swords, or, if he felt
<lb/>their merit greater still, a sword and belt.

<lb/>Thence <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> departed unto Pirs
<lb/>where lay his treasury. The capital
<lb/>was then <placeName>Istakhr</placeName>—the glory of the Kaians.
<lb/>With general assent he claimed the crown
<lb/>and, mounted on the <rs type="ethnic">Kaian</rs> throne, held sway
<lb/>by justice and the customs of the wise.
<lb/>He thus addressed the chiefs: <q>The world is mine.
<lb/>For elephants to war on gnats would make
<lb/>a breach in Faith and justice. I will have
<lb/>naught but the right, for of God’s anger cometh
<lb/>disaster. I have brought men peace by toil
<lb/>and justice, and where earth and water are
<lb/>my treasure is. Kings are my bodyguard ;

<lb/>Make God your refuge, be ye wise and harmless,

</p><p>
<lb/>He gathered troops,
<lb/>and went about inspecting everywhere.
<lb/>Thus for ten years he roved and ministered
<lb/>all justice publicly and privily.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.314"/>
<lb/>He built him many cities—<sic>jocund</sic> seats—

<pb n="23"/>

<lb/>such as the hundred that surrounded <placeName>Rai</placeName>,
<lb/>but when the hand of time had fallen upon him
<lb/>he set his face toward Pirs, sat on the throne
<lb/>'Mid <sic>archimages</sic>, readers of the stars,
<lb/>and sages, gathered too his warriors,
<lb/>and gazing on them with a wounded heart
<lb/>talked of the mighty who had passed away.
<lb/>His gifts and justice made the world rejoice,
<lb/>and thus he reached his hundredth year in joy.
<lb/>See if the world hath any king like him,
<lb/>he had four sons, all men endowed with wisdom,
<lb/>to keep his memory alive on earth :
<lb/>the first was glorious <persName>Kaus</persName>, the second
<lb/>was <persName>Kai Arash</persName>, the third was <persName>Kai Pashin</persName>,
<lb/>the fourth was <persName>Kai Armin</persName>. They walked the world
<lb/>in peace and great content.

</p><p>
<lb/>A century passed,
<lb/>a change of fortune came to crown and throne,
<lb/>for when the Shah perceived that death drew near,
<lb/>and that the green leaf was about to wither,
<lb/>he summoned noble <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, spake much
<lb/>of justice and of generosity,
<lb/>and said: <q>I load the baggage to depart.
<lb/>Perform mine obsequies and take the throne,
<lb/>though as for me I seem but just arrived
<lb/>rejoicing with my men from Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName>!
<lb/>Oh! what a thing is fortune thus to leave us

<lb/>lack wisdom. Thou, if thou art just and upright,
<lb/>wilt have thy <sic>guerdon</sic> in the other world,

<lb/>thou wilt <sic>unsheathe</sic> a sword whose edge is keen—
<lb/>a sword <sic>wherewith</sic> thou first wilt wound thyself
<lb/>and afterward resign it to the foe:

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.315"/>
<lb/>thy dwelling there will be a place of fire; 
<lb/>here bitterness of heart and grief be thine.</q>

<lb/>he spake these words and leaving this wide world
<lb/>exchanged his palace for a sepulchre :

<p><persName>Kai Kaus</persName> on ascending the throne abandons the path of wisdom. He invades <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> and is taken prisoner, but is rescued by <persName>Rustam</persName>. He wars against the king of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>, whose daughter he marries, and is taken prisoner again, this time by treachery. <persName>Rustam</persName> again rescues him. Afterward he attempts to fly to heaven, and is a third time saved by <persName>Rustam</persName>. The poet then tells two episodic stories, that of the Seven Warriors, and that of <persName>Suhrab</persName>, in both of which <persName>Rustam</persName> takes a leading part. We next learn what evil came of the marriage of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> with the daughter of the king of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> as exemplified in the tragic tale of <persName>Siyawush</persName>. The poet then tells how <persName>Rustam</persName> took vengeance on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> for the execution of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, how <persName>Giv</persName> went to <placeName>Turan</placeName> in quest of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, the son of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and how <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> became joint Shah with <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p><persName>Kai Kaus</persName> appears in the Vedas as Kavya Ushand, i.e. Ushana the son of Kavi. He is said to have installed <rs type="divinity">Agni</rs> (fire) as the high-priest of mankind, to have been the leader of the heavenly cows (the clouds) to pasturage, and to have wrought the iron club with which the god <rs type="divinity">Indra</rs> slew the demon <rs type="divinity">Vritra</rs>.<ref target="n.25.1"/></p>

<p>The conception is therefore mythological.

reference to his attempt to fly to heaven the remainder of his legend is lost so far as the Zandavasta itself is concerned, but a brief summary of what it once contained is extant in the Dinkard,<ref target="n.26.1"/> where we also find a strange story, of which no trace is to be found in the <persName>Shahnama</persName>, that <persName>Kai <persName>Kaus</persName></persName> possessed a wonderful ox, to whose judgment all disputes as to the frontier-line between iran andTuran were referred. As the decision was generally adverse to the <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs> they conceived the idea of beguiling <persName>Kaus</persName> into slaying the ox, and succeeded in their purpose.<ref target="n.26.2"/> The story is characteristic of <persName>Kai <persName>Kaus</persName></persName>, who is represented in the poem as a very imperfect character, and easily led astray by passion, <sic>wrongheadedness</sic>, and evil counsels.</p>

<p>According to the genealogy of the Bundahish, <persName>Kaus</persName> was the grandson of <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>.<ref target="n.26.3"/> <persName>Firdausi</persName> omits the intermediate generation.</p>

<p>The length of the reign is the same in both cases, and the Bundahish places <persName>Kaus</persName>' attempt to reach the sky after he had been on the throne for seventy-five years,<ref target="n.26.4"/> and was, so to speak, at his meridian.</p>

<p>The poet, after bewailing the death of <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> and that an evil shoot should spring from so good a root, tells how <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> was seduced by a div into invading <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, how he and all his host were taken captive and blinded by the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>, how <persName>Rustam</persName> went to their rescue, what adventures befell him by the way, and how he delivered the Shah and host.</p>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, the ancient <placeName>Hyrcania</placeName>, lay, in the scheme of the old cosmogony, beyond the limits of the Central Clime<ref target="n.27.1"/> from which it was cut off by the great range of the <placeName>Alburz</placeName> Mountains, and extended from their northern scarp to the shores of the <placeName>Caspian</placeName>. Being abundantly supplied with moisture by the clouds which are stopped by, and the snow-fields which form upon, the <placeName>Alburz</placeName> Mountains, and the soil moreover being warmed by volcanic heat, the country is extremely fertile and the climate semi-tropical in character. <q>The <sic>lagunes</sic> of the coast are succeeded by marsh forests; higher up are fields of rice and plantations of sugar-cane, and beyond these fertile meadows, above which splendid forests of oaks, planes, and elms clothe the heights of <placeName>Elburz</placeName>. There is abundance of water fruits, figs and mulberries, olives and oranges, and the vigorous creepers of the vines run even to the summits of the trees.</q><ref target="n.27.2"/> On the other hand the climate is unhealthy and the air of the marshes <sic>blanches</sic> the inhabitants,<ref target="n.27.3"/> who for this reason were known to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> as white <sic>divs</sic> or demons. They are referred to in the Zandavasta and in the Pahlavi texts. <q>These are the words,</q> we read in the former, with reference toa sacred formula which had to be recited several times, <q>that smite down

<p>In the Dinkard they seem to be described as inhabiting burrows and caves, and as <sic>heing</sic> of filthy habits.<ref target="n.28.3"/> In the <persName>Shahnama</persName> we find this blanched race personified as the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> whom <persName>Rustam</persName> in his expedition into <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> encounters in the cave.<ref target="n.28.4"/></p>

<p>The approach to <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> from iran was difficult and romantic, Communication between western and eastern <placeName>Iran</placeName> depends on two routes which, branching from <placeName>Tihran</placeName>, run to the south of, and parallel to, the <placeName>Alburz</placeName> range, an outlying spur of which they cross at two passes named the <placeName>Firuzi Kuh</placeName> and the Girduni Sirdarra respectively. At a distance of about seventy miles from <placeName>Tihran</placeName> the route that runs through the <placeName>Firuzi Kuh</placeName> sends off a branch northward toward <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>. This branch is a mere fissure, a few feet wide, in the mountain-wall, with a stream running at the bottom and water trickling down the precipitous sides, while here and there the fissure opens out into natural grottos and narrow valleys. This route, which abounds with game and is one of the favourite hunting-grounds of the Shahs, is known as the Girduni Sawachi. Subsequently the pass of the <placeName>Firuzi Kuh</placeName>, six miles to the east of the mountain of that name, after traversing a tremendous gorge, sends off another branch to <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> of a somewhat less romantic character than that of the Girduni Sawachi, and runs on to Astrabad, whence also <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> may be reached.<ref target="n.28.5"/></p>

<p>It was on emerging from the gloom of one of these passes that <persName>Rustam</persName>, we may imagine, reached the smiling land where he encountered <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs>, whose account of the extent of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> is of course enormously exaggerated.<ref target="n.28.6"/> The reader will see on looking ata map of <placeName>Persia</placeName> that <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> is a region of quite moderate dimensions, Accuracy in matters geographical is not one of <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s strong points.</p>

<p>With regard to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s route we are told that by <persName>Zal</persName>’s advice<ref target="n.28.7"/> he took the short road, not the long one taken by <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>. Of course he would not take the latter, for <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, we may presume, started from <placeName>Istakhr</placeName> in <placeName>Pars</placeName>, <sic>tothe</sic> west of the central desert, while <persName>Rustam</persName> started from <placeName>Zabul</placeName>, to the east of it. <persName>Firdausi</persName> merely means to indicate that <persName>Rustam</persName> did not follow the ordinary route, but cut as the crow flies across the waste. This route took, we are told, fourteen days, but <persName>Rustam</persName> ran a two days' journey into one

and made seven stages of it, in the course of each of which he met with an adventure. This expedition of his is accordingly known as the <q>Haft Khan,</q> the former word meaning seven and the latter the tray on which food is served up. His expedition therefore may be regarded as being a meal with seven courses. It has also been suggested that in the account of the seven buildings of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, described in Part II. § 8 of this reign, we have the origin of the Haft Khan of <persName>Rustam</persName>, and also of the similar expedition, which occurs much later in the poem, of <persName>Asfandiyar</persName> against <persName>Arjasp</persName>.<ref target="n.29.1"/></p>

<p>We may add that in the Pahlavi the word used for these buildings is <q>min.</q> <q>Miin</q> comes from the same root as our word <q>mansion.</q> In the Pahlavi form of the legend <persName>Rustam</persName>’s expedition may have been known as the Haft Man. In the translations from the Pahlavi legend, if such existed, this would naturally become <q>Haft Khan,</q> the seven stopping-places or rest-houses, and this might easily be corrupted into the <q> Haft Khan,</q> the seven meals partaken of therein. Our text, however, has <q> Haft Khwan,</q> which we translate <q>The Seven Courses,</q> keeping the collocation of <q>The Seven Stages</q> for the corresponding expedition of <persName>Asfandiyar</persName>.</p>

<p>With regard to the opposition of the chiefs to the expedition of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> to <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> as being unprecedented,<ref target="n.29.2"/> we can only suppose it to be a rhetorical flourish put into their mouths by the poet, who has already told us that <persName>Faridun</persName> and <persName>Minuchihr</persName> resided there.<ref target="n.29.3"/></p>

<lb/>with all the world to serve him, looked upon
<lb/>heaped hoards of treasures manifold, and knew
<lb/>that he had not his peer on earth for wealth
<lb/>of necklaces, of earrings, and of thrones,
<lb/>high-crested <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steeds, and golden crowns
<lb/>inlaid with emeralds.

</p><p>
<lb/>Now as it chanced
<lb/>he sat one day and <sic>quafted</sic> delicious wine
<lb/>within a pleasure-palace <sic>arabesqued</sic>
<lb/>with gold, and sat upon the golden throne,
<lb/>whose feet were crystal, master of the world,
<lb/>discussing many matters great and small
<lb/>in converse with the Iranian paladins,

<note xml:id="n.30.1">There is no break here in the original.</note>

<pb n="31"/>

<lb/>and spake on this wise: <q> Who is Shah but I, -
<lb/>who worthy of the throne except myself?
<lb/>I rule the world with none to say me nay.</q>

<lb/>The Shah was thus conversing in his cups,
<lb/>what while the captains wondered, when a div
<lb/>in minstrel’s guise addressed the <sic>chainberlain</sic>.

<lb/><q> A native of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> am I,</q>

<lb/>He said. <q>a noted bard. If I am worthy

<lb/>to serve the Shah let me approach his throne.</q>
-The chamberlain walked stately to the Shah,

<lb/>and said: <q> There is a minstrel at the gate—

<lb/>a rare musician—and he hath his harp.</q>

<lb/>The Shah bade fetch the man and set him down
<lb/>among the harpers. When his harp was tuned
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.317"/>

<lb/>he sang a ditty of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> :—



<lg>
<l><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, my native land!</l>
<l>May I forget it never,</l>
<l>And may its fields and fells abide</l>
<l>As populous as ever,</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>For on its heights the hyacinth</l>
<l>And tulip bloom, while roses</l>
<l>Are ever blossoming anew</l>
<l>Within its garden-closes.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l>The landscape is fulfilled with charm,</l>
<l>The atmosphere is pleasant,</l>
<l>And there is neither heat nor cold,</l>
<l>But spring is ever present.</l>
</lg>

<lg>

<l>While in each garth the nightingale</l>
<l>Discourseth musically,</l>
<l>The deer are pacing daintily</l>
<l>In every mountain valley</l>
</lg>

<pb n="32"/>

<lg>
<l>Throughout the year without a break</l>
<l>Intent upon their questing,</l>
<l>And evermore the hues are bright,</l>
<l>And scents exhale <sic>unresting</sic>.</l>

</lg><lg>
<l>As for the rivers thou wouldst say :—</l>
<l>'They run rose-water surely!'</l>
<l>And at the fragrance breathing thence</l>
<l>The soul <sic>rejoiceth</sic> purely.</l>

</lg><lg>
<l>There when the year is young and when</l>
<l>'Tis many a month the older,</l>
<l>A soil all tulips and a~-bloom</l>
<l>Saluteth the beholder.</l>

</lg><lg>

<l>The <sic>livelong</sic> year the <sic>streamlet</sic>’s lips</l>
<l>Are laughing, and the foray</l>
<l>Of hawk and hunter after game</l>
<l>Will never fail of quarry.</l>

</lg><lg>

<l>The provinces are gaily <sic>dight</sic></l>
<l>Throughout their whole dimensions</l>
<l>With golden coins and with brocade,</l>
<l>And <sic>goodliest</sic> inventions ;</l>

</lg><lg>

<l>The handmaids there, as idols fair,</l>
<l>Are crowned with crowns all golden,</l>
<l>And there the loins of all the great</l>
<l>With belts of gold are holden.</l>

</lg><lg>

<l>He that is not in that fair land</l>
<l>Of joy exceeding measure,</l>
<l>Delighting heart and mind alike,</l>
<l>What can he know of pleasure ?"</l>
</lg>

<pb n="33"/>
<lb/>the words roused <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, he was resolved
<lb/>to lead a host against <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>and thus harangued his warriors : <q> We have been
<lb/>too fond of feast. The brave but indolent
<lb/>will never tire of leisure and of home.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.318"/>
<lb/>In fortune, <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, and birth I pass <persName>Jamshid</persName>, 
<lb/>Zabhik, and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>, and must surpass them
<lb/>in prowess too: crowned heads should be ambitious.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The nobles heard and liked it not, turned pale,
<lb/>and frowned, for no one wished to fight the <sic>divs</sic>,
<lb/>though daring not to say so openly.
<lb/>They sadly sighed—<persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <persName>Kishwad</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Kharrad</persName>, <persName>Gurgin</persName>, and brave <persName>Bahram</persName>—and said :—
<lb/><q>Thy slaves are we and walk earth by thy will.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>They met thereafter and spake out their minds :-—
<lb/><q>What is this turn of fortune? If the Shah
<lb/>Remembereth the words said in his cups
"Twill be the ruin of us and of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and leave the land not even dust and water.
<lb/><persName>Jamshid</persName> possessed the crown and finger-ring,
<lb/>with div and fowl and fay to do his will,
<lb/>yet spake he never of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>or sought to fight against the valiant <sic>divs</sic>,
<lb/>while <persName>Faridun</persName> with all his craft and wisdom
<lb/>ne’er guided us to any such desire.
<lb/>Had it been something fitting to achieve
<lb/>by dint of manliness, name, gems, and treasure,
<lb/>then <persName>Minuchihr</persName> would have forestalled the matter
<lb/>and not repressed his wishes. We must find
<lb/>some scheme to turn this evil from <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q>

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.319"/><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName> addressed the chiefs: <q>Brave veterans ! 
<lb/>One remedy there is, and let us use it,
<lb/>for 'tis not hard. Send we a <sic>cameleer</sic>
<lb/>in haste to <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName> to say :-
<lb/><q>If now thy head be soiled stay not to wash it,

<lb/>but whet thy wits and let us see thy face.</q>


<pb n="34"/>

<lb/>he may suggest some wise <sic>rede</sic> to the Shah,
<lb/>and tell him: <q><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> hath prompted this:
<lb/>the portal of the <sic>divs</sic> must ne’er be opened.</q>
<lb/>unless <persName>Zal</persName> can divert him from such talk
<lb/>an end will come to all our ups and downs.</q>

<lb/>They talked it o’er, then sent a <sic>cameleer</sic>,
<lb/>who went apace toward <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>, and when
<lb/>he came to <persName>Zal</persName>—the lustre of the world—
<lb/>gave thus the nobles' message: <q> High-born son
<lb/>of <persName>Sam</persName>! a parlous case <sic>confronteth</sic> us,
<lb/>and one that knowledge <sic>cannot</sic> estimate !
<lb/>Bestir thyself or else we shall not have
<lb/>folk, field, or fell. A fancy hath arisen
<lb/>within the Shah’s heart. <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> hath turned him
<lb/>from what is right, he is not satisfied
<lb/>with travail such as his forefathers had,
<lb/>but would have treasure where he hath not toiled,
<lb/>and so must throne it in <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> !
<lb/>If thou <sic>delayest</sic> but to scratch thy head
<lb/>he will have gone and given to the winds
<lb/>thy travail at the first with <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.320"/>
<lb/>when thou with <persName>Rustam</persName>—that <sic>insatiate</sic> Lion—
<lb/>didst like a valiant lion gird thy loins ;:
<lb/>all which is now as wind to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>whose evil purposes distract his mind.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> when he heard grieved sorely that the leaves
<lb/>upon the royal tree were growing <sic>sere</sic>,
<lb/>and said: <q> <persName>Kaus</persName>, that man of headstrong will,
<lb/>and not approved in this world’s heat and cold,
<lb/>will hearken not to what the experienced say,
<lb/>and <sic>sleepeth</sic> not upon his own designs.
<lb/>If one who is the monarch of the world,
<lb/>whom years and sun and moon still circle o’er,
<lb/>one at the thought of whose sword everywhere
<lb/>alike the nobles and the people tremble,
<lb/>will not obey me 'tis not wonderful ;

<pb n="35"/>

<lb/>still it would grieve me if he <sic>hearkened</sic> not.
<lb/>If I think of myself, not of the Shah,
<lb/>then God, the Shah, and all the warriors
<lb/>throughout <placeName>Iran</placeName>, will be displeased at me.
<lb/>I will set out and offer mine advice ;
<lb/>if he <sic>accepteth</sic> it so much is gained ;
<lb/>if he is headstrong then our course is clear,
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName> now will be among the troops.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He mused all night, and when the sun displayed
<lb/>its crown on high <sic>begirt</sic> himself and journeyed,
<lb/>escorted by the chiefs, toward the Shah.
<lb/>Intelligence reached <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName>, <persName>Gurgin</persName>, and others: <q> <persName>Zal</persName> <sic>approacheth</sic> ;
<lb/>Een now his royal standard is in sight.</q>

<lb/>The army-leaders, <sic>helmed</sic> as paladins,
<lb/>went forth to meet him and, when he was near,
<lb/>dismounted, went to him afoot, and blessed him.
<lb/>Now, as they fared together to the Shah,
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> said to <persName>Zal</persName>: <q>So then, O noble chief!
<lb/>Thou hast endured a journey of much toil,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.321"/>
<lb/>and for the sake of us Iranian nobles 
<lb/>hast chosen travail rather than repose !
<lb/>We are devoted to thee: all of us
<lb/>feel honoured by thy crown and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> answered :

<lb/><q>The maxims of the men of old recur 
<lb/>to one whom years have worn, and later on
<lb/>the course of heaven will justify his conduct.
<lb/>We must not keep our counsel from the Shah,
<lb/>for he hath need thereof. If he <sic>rejecteth</sic>
<lb/>the words of wisdom he will rue it sorely.</q>

<lb/>They cried: <q> We are agreed and will not hear
<lb/>another’s words,</q> then sought with one accord
<lb/>the crown and throne and presence of their lord.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<head>How <persName>Zal</persName> gave Counsel to <persName>Kaus</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Attended by the lords with golden girdles
<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> led the way and, when he saw <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>rejoicing on the throne, approached the state
<lb/>with downcast eyes and folded arms, then said :—
<lb/><q>O <sic>worldlord</sic>, who art mightiest of the mighty!
<lb/>Throne hath not heard of, nor crown seen, thy peer,
<lb/>revolving heaven hath heard not of such fortune,
<lb/>as thine. Be victor all thy years and glad
<lb/>with heart all wisdom and with head all justice.</q>

<lb/>The famous Shah received <persName>Zal</persName> graciously,
<lb/>and, giving him a seat upon the throne,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.322"/>
<lb/>asked him about the toil of that long journey,
<lb/>about the chieftains and exalted <persName>Rustam</persName>.
<lb/>He answered: <q>Ever live and conquer, Shah!
<lb/>We all are blithe and brightened by thy fortune,
<lb/>and have our heads exalted by thy throne.</q>

<lb/>He then began his well considered speech :—
<lb/><q>Q monarch of the world! thou well <sic>deservest</sic>
<lb/>to have the throne and crown of mighty men.
<lb/>Thou art the memory of Shah <persName>Faridun</persName>,
<lb/>and may this age ne’er rob thee of its love.
<lb/>Now I have heard grave tidings that the Shah
<lb/>hath some design upon <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.323"/>
<lb/>None of thy mighty predecessors thought
<lb/>of such a journey. <persName>Minuchihr</persName> in dying
<lb/>left here much wealth and many palaces ;
<lb/>so too did <persName>Zav</persName>, <persName>Naudar</persName>, and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>
(How many a chief our memories recall
<lb/>with massive <sic>maces</sic> and with mighty hosts !)
<lb/>yet they attempted not <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>—
<lb/>the home of warlock-<sic>divs</sic> and under spells
<lb/>which none hath power to loose; so give not thou

<pb n="37"/>

<lb/>men, wealth, and money to the winds. That land
<lb/>can not be conquered by the scimitar,
<lb/>nor will it come to hand through wit and treasure.
<lb/>To go or e’en to think of going thither
<lb/>is held unlucky! Thou must not invade
<lb/>those parts because no Shah hath thought it good,
<lb/>who if less great than thou was still God’s slave:
<lb/>then do not for the sake of <sic>covetise</sic>
<lb/>plant with the blood of such a famous head
<lb/>a tree whose growth and fruit will prove a curse,
<lb/>and break the precedents of former Shahs.</q> 
<lb/>Kits replied: <q>I need thy views <sic>hereon</sic>,
<lb/>but <sic>nathless</sic> I in courage, <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, and treasure
<lb/>surpass <persName>Jamshid</persName> and <persName>Faridun</persName> as well
<lb/>as <persName>Minuchihr</persName> and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>, who never
<lb/>made mention of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>; my heart
<lb/>and host are greater, and the world is 'neath
<lb/>my trenchant scimitar, The world was won
<lb/>when thou didst brandish thine; let it see ours.
<lb/>I shall go thither, snare them all, maintaining
<lb/>the credit of myself and scimitar,
<lb/>then tax them heavily or leave all dead,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.324"/>
<lb/>so vile and wretched do I hold that crew 
<lb/>of <sic>divs</sic> and sorcerers, and thou wilt hear
<lb/>that earth is void of them. Do thou and <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>be regents of <placeName>Iran</placeName> and slumber not.
<lb/>God is my Helper and the prince of <sic>divs</sic>
<lb/>my quarry. Since thou wilt not go with me
<lb/>bid me not dally on my throne.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> heard,
<lb/>and baffled answered: <q>Thou art Shah, and we
<lb/>are slaves who speak in love and, right or wrong,
<lb/>must move and breathe according to thy will.
<lb/>I have relieved my heart as knowledge prompted.
<lb/>No one can root out death, sew up the eyes 7
<lb/>of destiny with needles, or escape

<pb n="38"/>

<lb/>from want by abstinence; in this regard
<lb/>hen princes must submit. May this bright world
<lb/>prove prosperous to thee, and <sic>mayst</sic> thou never
<lb/>have reason to recall these words of mine;
<lb/>may thine own doings cause thee no remorse,
<lb/>and be thy heart and Faith and rule resplendent.</q>

<lb/>Grieved that the Shah would go <persName>Zal</persName> took his leave
<lb/>in haste, and as he left the monarch’s presence
<lb/>both sun and moon were darkened in his eyes.
<lb/>The gallant nobles—<persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <persName>Bahram</persName>,
<lb/>and <persName>Giv</persName>—went with him, and <persName>Giv</persName> said to <persName>Zal</persName> :—
<lb/><q>May God direct us! Were <persName>Kaus</persName> not Shah
<lb/>I should esteem him naught. May greed, death, want,
<lb/>be far from thee, foes' hands too short to reach thee.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.325"/>

<lb/>Where’er we be or go we hear thy praises,
<lb/>and next to God trust thee who hath so toiled
<lb/>for us.</q>

<lb/>Thus <persName>Giv</persName>. <persName>Zal</persName>, clasping to his heart

<lb/>Next day arose the <sic>tymbals</sic>' din, <persName>Gudarz</persName>

<lb/>and <persName>Tus</persName> led on the troops. <persName>Kaus</persName>, their lustre,
<lb/>went with them, and upon a shaded spot

<lb/>set up his throne before Mount <placeName>Ispuruz</placeName>

<lb/>for rest and sleep, while terror everywhere

<lb/>fell on the brutish <sic>divs</sic>. Upon the heights

<lb/>the Shah spread cloth of gold; the air was fragrant

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.326"/>
<lb/>with luscious wine ; the favoured paladins

<lb/>sat by his throne and spent the night together.

<lb/>At dawn they woke and entered <sic>helmed</sic> and armed
<lb/>the presence of the Shah, who ordered <persName>Giv</persName> :—

<lb/><q> Choose from the warriors two thousand men—

<pb n="39"/>

<lb/>mace-<sic>wielders</sic>-——to prepare for us a path
<lb/><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>-ward, slaughter young and old,

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> girt him, left the portal of the Shah,
<lb/>chose valiant warriors, and when he reached
<lb/><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> showered <sic>scimitars</sic> and <sic>maces</sic>.
<lb/>The women, children, and old men with staves,
<lb/>received no quarter from his sword ; he sacked
<lb/>and burned the cities, scattering bane instead
<lb/>of antidote. He lighted on a spot
<lb/>like Paradise, replete with all delights,
<lb/>and in each street and quarter countless slaves
<lb/>with necklaces and earrings, and still more
<lb/>with <sic>casques</sic> and faces like the shining moon.
<lb/>In every place were treasures stored away,
<lb/>here gold, there gems. The cattle were past count.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>'Tis Paradise itself!</q>
<lb/>They told <persName>Kaus</persName> the news, who cried: <q> Live happy

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.327"/>
<lb/>the man who said: <q><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> may match 
<lb/>with Paradise, and thou wouldst say that all

<lb/>with wreaths of roses and brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName> ;
<lb/>its Idols come from Paradise with faces
<lb/>bathed in pomegranate-blossoms by <rs type="divinity">Rizwan</rs>.</q></q> <ref target="n.39.1"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> plundered for one week, then ceased.
<lb/>The monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> received
<lb/>the news; his heart was sad, his head was heavy.
<lb/>There was a div named <rs type="divinity">Sanja</rs> at the court,
<lb/>who also grieved. The monarch said to him :—
<lb/><q>Go swift as Sol in yonder circling heaven
<lb/>and tell the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>: <q>There hath come a host
<lb/>out of <placeName>Iran</placeName> to spoil <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> ;

<note xml:id="n.39.1">The door-keeper of Paradise.</note>

<lb/>with many young and brave, is in command
<lb/>without thy help we shall be all destroyed.</q></q>

<lb/>When <rs type="divinity">Sanja</rs> heard the message he sped forth
<lb/>and carried to the div the king’s appeal.

<lb/>The White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> answered: <q>Be not in despair,
<lb/>for I am coming with a mighty host
<lb/>to cut the Shah’s foot from <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>.</q>

<lb/>He spake and like a mountain rose erect ;
<lb/>his head was level with the turning sky.
</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.328"/><p>
<lb/>Night came, a cloud involved the Iranian host,
<lb/>the world grew like a negro’s face for blackness,
<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q>Tis like a sea of pitch,
<lb/>and all its light is lost.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.329"/><p>
<lb/>The White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> spread
<lb/>above their heads a tent of <sic>pitchy</sic> smoke,
<lb/>air <sic>dusked</sic> and eyes were darkened. From the sky
<lb/>he showered stones and darts, the Iranian troops
<lb/>dispersed abroad, and many sought <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>heart-broken at the doings of <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<lb/>When day had come the ambitious Shah and most
<lb/>among his warriors were blind. The nobles
<lb/>were <sic>wroth</sic> with him, his troops were prisoners,
<lb/>his treasures pillaged, and his fortunes old.
<lb/>It is a ne’er to be forgotten tale,
<lb/>for at such wonders wonder’s self must fail!
<lb/>Now when the Shah perceived his plight he said :—
<lb/><q> A prudent minister is more than treasure;
<lb/>alas that I accepted not the counsel
<lb/>of <persName>Zal</persName> the <sic>worldlord</sic> but <sic>misdoubted</sic> it.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>When he had passed seven days in misery
<lb/>and looked on no Iranian, on the eighth
<lb/>the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> thundered at him: <q>O thou Shah,
<lb/>as fruitless as a willow! thou wouldst have
<lb/>complete supremacy and seize our pastures.

<lb/>Like to a maddened elephant’s appeared
<lb/>thy strength to thee, thou wouldst not yield to any!

<pb n="41"/>

<lb/>content not with the crown above thy throne
<lb/>thou hast perverted wisdom and hast wrought

<lb/>with massive mace. The news of mine achievements 
<lb/>perchance ne’er reached thee, such a dullard thou
<lb/>on thine imperial throne! Now thou hast gained
<lb/>the fitting outcome of thy heart’s desire.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then of the valiant <sic>divs</sic> that drew the sword
<lb/>he chose twelve thousand. setting them to guard
<lb/>the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, and <sic>aftlicted</sic> grievously
<lb/>those headstrong men. He gave them food enough
<lb/>to keep them living on from day to day,
<lb/>while all the treasures of the Shah and host,
<lb/>the jewelled <sic>diadems</sic> and turquoise thrones,
<lb/>all that he saw, he gave o’er to <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs>,
<lb/>the general of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, and said :—
<lb/><q> Convey these to the king and say to him :—
<lb/><q>Blame not thou <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>, for I have done
<lb/>all that was needed, and have brought yon folk
<lb/>to dust. The Shah and paladins will never
<lb/>behold the bright sun or the moon again.
<lb/>I have not threatened him with death, but taught him
<lb/>the ups and downs of fortune. He will grow

<lb/>Thereat <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs> 

<lb/>went to the monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>and took with him the treasure and the troops,
<lb/>the captives and the steeds caparisoned.
<lb/>This done the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> went back to his home
<lb/>as glorious as the sun, while <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>

<lb/>and told what he had seen and heard to <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>whose skin burst at the tidings, but he kept
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.332"/>

<lb/>the news from friend and foe. His shrewd heart showed him
<lb/>the ills that fate would bring upon <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<lb/><q>The scimitar is all but out,</q> he said
<lb/>to <persName>Rustam</persName>. <q>We must not thus feed at ease,
<lb/>but make provision for the crown itself,
<lb/>because the Shah is in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s breath:
<lb/>how great a bale is on the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> !
<lb/>Thy part is now to saddle <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and seek
<lb/>for vengeance with the world-allotting sword.
<lb/>God surely made thee for a time like this,
<lb/>and thou art fitted for such labours now,
<lb/>while I, I have outlived two centuries !
<lb/>Thou wilt gain high renown and save the Shah.

<pb n="43"/>

<lb/>thou must not in this <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>’s own business
<lb/>take matters leisurely or stop to breathe,
<lb/>but don the tiger-skin and purge thy head
<lb/>of sleep and thought. When one hath seen thy spear
<lb/>will any say: <q>His soul will rest?</q> If thou
<lb/>Shouldst fight the sea '<sic>twould</sic> turn to blood, thy voice
<lb/>will level mountains, Thou must make <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs>,
<lb/>and the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> no less, despair of life.
<lb/>As for the monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>go smash him, neck and spine, with thy great mace.</q>

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.333"/><p>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>The way is long,and I . . . 

<lb/>How shall I go to take revenge ?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Said <persName>Zal</persName>:—

<lb/><q>There are two routes both hard and dangerous ;
<lb/>one, which is long, was taken by <persName>Kaus</persName>;
<lb/>the other is a journey of two weeks,
<lb/>the haunt of div and lion, and all gloom ;
<lb/>its murk will maze thine eyes. Choose thou the short,
<lb/>and see its wonders; God will be thine aid.
<lb/>What though the way be hard? An end will come,
<lb/>the feet of glorious <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> will traverse it,
<lb/>and I will pray all night to see again
<lb/>thy limbs and iron mace; while if the Worldlord
<lb/>shall let the <sic>divs</sic>' grip close upon thy life,
<lb/>who can resist His word? Tis said and done.
<lb/>None can abide here though he tarry long,
<lb/>and one whose fame <sic>embraceth</sic> all the world
<lb/>is not cast down at going.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> answered :—

<lb/><q>I gird me to obey although the great
<lb/>of yore walked not to Hell advisedly,
<lb/>and only one grown sick of life will counter
<lb/>the rending lion. Think of me as girt
<lb/>and gone. I ask no help but God’s, will give
<lb/>both soul and body for the Shah, and break
<lb/>the talismans that guard those sorcerers.

<pb n="44"/>

<lb/>all that survive among the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> there
<lb/>will I bring back and gird their loins again;
<lb/>I will not spare the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> nor <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs>,
<lb/>nor <rs type="divinity">Sanja</rs> nor <persName>Pulad</persName> son of <rs type="divinity">Ghundi</rs>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.334"/>
<lb/>nor <rs type="divinity">Bid</rs>. I swear by God, the only God,
<lb/>not to quit <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> till I have bound. <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs>
<lb/>with yoke on neck and hands as firm as rocks,
<lb/>have trod the brains and headpiece of <persName>Pulad</persName>,
<lb/>and shaken earth beneath the feet of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He donned the tiger-skin and stretched himself,
<lb/>while <persName>Zal</persName> called many blessings down on him,
<lb/>then mounted on his elephantine steed
<lb/>with steadfast heart and mien. <persName>Rudaba</persName> came
<lb/>with tearful cheeks while <persName>Zal</persName> too wept. She said :—
<lb/><q>So thou wilt go and leave me here to grieve!
<lb/>How canst thou hope in God?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>Good mother!
<lb/>I did net choose my course ; 'tis destiny.
<lb/>Do thou commit to God my soul and body.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The people came to him to say farewell ;
<lb/>who knew if he should look on <persName>Rustam</persName> more ?
</p><p>
<lb/>Uncounted by the wise the moments fly,

<head>The seven courses of <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<head>The First Course: How <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> fought with a Lion</head>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.335"/><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, that world-brightening paladin,
<lb/>departed from his sire and, treating night
<lb/>like day, made two days' journey into one,

<pb n="45"/>

<lb/>not giving <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> repose. Now as his body
<lb/>failed him through lack of food he reached a plain
<lb/>where <sic>onager</sic> abounded, and urged <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>to whom their speed was slow: no beast could scape
<lb/>from <persName>Rustam</persName>’s lasso and his horse’s feet.
<lb/>The Lion with his royal lasso caught
<lb/>a gallant <sic>onager</sic> and, striking sparks
<lb/>upon an arrow’s point, <sic>enkindled</sic> fire
<lb/>with stubble, thorns, and wood to roast the beast.
<lb/>He ate the flesh and threw away the bones;
<lb/>the <sic>onager</sic> itself was pot and tray.
<lb/>He spied some pasture, slipped off <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>’s bridle,
<lb/>turned him out loose upon the meadow-land,
<lb/>and made himself a couch within a reed-bed ;
<lb/>he deemed it safe though it was fear’s own door,
<lb/>for in it was a lion’s lair; no elephant
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.336"/>
<lb/>dared pluck a reed. One watch passed, then the lion 
<lb/>came boldly forth and was amazed to see
<lb/>an elephantine form among the reeds,
<lb/>reposing with a charger standing by.
<lb/><q> First,</q> said the lion, <q>I must maim the steed,
<lb/>then I can take the rider when I please.</q>

<lb/>He sprang at glossy <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>, who raged like fire
<lb/>and lashed out at the lion’s head, then fixed
<lb/>his sharp teeth in its back and dashed the beast
<lb/>to pieces by a shift that made it shiftless.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName>, deft of hand, awoke and saw
<lb/>how earth was straitened to that ravening beast
<lb/>he said: <q>O foolish <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>! who bade thee fight
<lb/>a lion? Hadst thou perished 'neath its claws
<lb/>could I have carried to <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>my helmet, tiger-skin, bow, lasso, sword,
<lb/>and massive mace? Had my sweet sleep been broken

<lb/>thy combat with the lion had been brief.</q>

<lb/>He slept and rested long, and when the sun

<pb n="46"/>

<lb/>rose o’er the <sic>darksome</sic> hills awoke still drowsy ;
<lb/>he rubbed down <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and saddled him, then prayed
<lb/>to God, the Author of all good, for aid.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<head>The second course: How <persName>Rustam</persName> found a Spring</head>
<p>



<lb/>He had to face all dizzy as he was
<lb/>a desert waterless, a heat intense
<lb/>that dried the birds to powder; plain and waste
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.337"/>

<lb/>were as they had been scorched thou wouldst have said.
<lb/><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> was exhausted, while his rider's tongue
<lb/>failed through the heat and drought, and <persName>Rustam</persName>, clutching
<lb/>a double-headed dart, went staggering
<lb/>like one bemused, and saw no means of safety.
<lb/>He looked up saying: <q>O all-righteous Judge !
<lb/>Thou bring’st all toil and hardship on my head,
<lb/>and if Thou <sic>findest</sic> pleasure in my pains
<lb/>my hoard is great indeed! I fare in hope
<lb/>that God will grant deliverance to the-Shah,
<lb/>and that the Ruler of the world will free
<lb/>the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> from the clutches of the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>,
<lb/>unscathed. They sinned, and Thou hast cast them out,
<lb/>but still they are Thy slaves and worshippers.</q>
</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.338"/><p>
<lb/>This said, that elephantine form became
<lb/>weak and distraught with thirst, and fell, with tongue
<lb/>all cracked and blistered, on the burning dust,
<lb/>anon a well-fed ram passed by. The hero
<lb/>on seeing thought: <q> Where is its watering-place ?
<lb/>In sooth God’s mercy is extended to me!</q>
<lb/>Then in the Worldlord’s strength rose to his feet
<lb/>and followed up the ram, with scimitar

<pb n="47"/>

<lb/>in one hand while the other grasped the reins,
<lb/>until he saw the spring, for thither went
<lb/>that stately ram. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> looked toward heaven,
<lb/>and said: <q>O Judge, that ever <sic>speakest</sic> sooth !
<lb/>The ram hath left no tracks about the spring!
<lb/>It is no desert-sheep of flesh and blood !</q>
</p><p>


<lb/>When hardships press on thee, in thy concern
<lb/>flee unto God, the Just One; they who turn
<lb/>away from Him have wisdom still to learn. 

</p><p>

<lb/>He blessed that ram and said: <q> Ne’er may mishap
<lb/>from circling heaven be thine; green be thy pastures ;
<lb/>may cheetah never mark thee for its prey ;
<lb/>snapped be the bow and dark the soul of him
<lb/>that <sic>shooteth</sic> at thee who hath rescued <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>else were he thinking of his shroud; but now
<lb/>he is not in the mighty dragon’s maw
<lb/>as yet, or in the clutches of the wolf,
<lb/>so that the fragments of his clothes and limbs
<lb/>should serve as tokens to his enemies.</q>
</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.339"/><p>

<lb/>His praises offered he unsaddled <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>washed him, and made him shining as the sun.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> much refreshed filled up his quiver
<lb/>and as he hunted dropped an <sic>onager</sic>
<lb/>huge as an elephant, removed the entrails,
<lb/>the hide, and feet, lit up a blazing fire,
<lb/>and having washed the carcase roasted it.
<lb/>This done he feasted, breaking up the bones,
<lb/>and having quenched his thirst prepared for sleep.
<lb/>He said to <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>: <q> Fight not and make no friends.
<lb/>If any foe <sic>approacheth</sic> run to me,
<lb/>but venture not to counter <sic>divs</sic> and lions,</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He lay and slept, his lips in silence bound,

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<head>The third course: how <persName>Rustam</persName> fought with a <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></head>
<p>



<lb/>A dragon, such an one as, thou hadst said,

<lb/>no elephant could 'scape, came from the waste.

<lb/>Its haunt was there; no div dared pass thereby.

<lb/>It came, beheld the <sic>atheling</sic> asleep,

<lb/>a charger near him, and was <sic>wroth</sic>. It thought :—

<lb/><q>What do I see? Who <sic>dareth</sic> to sleep here?</q>

<lb/>Because no lions, <sic>divs</sic>, or elephants

<lb/>dared pass that way or, if they did, escaped not

<lb/>the clutches of that dragon fierce and fell.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.340"/>
<lb/>It turned on glossy <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>, who ran to <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<lb/>stamped with his brazen hoofs upon the ground,

<lb/>whisked with his tail, and gave a thundering neigh.

<lb/>The hero woke up furious, looked about

<lb/>upon the waste, perceived not that fell dragon,

<lb/>and wreaked his wrath on <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> for waking him.

<lb/>He slept again, again the worm approached

<lb/>out of the gloom; <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> ran to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s couch,

<lb/>and kicked the earth about and trampled it.

<lb/>The sleeper woke, his cheeks rose-red with passion,

<lb/>looked round and, seeing nothing but the gloom,

<lb/>said to affectionate and watchful <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> :-—

<lb/><q> Thou canst not blink the darkness of the night

<lb/>yet <sic>wakest</sic> me again impatiently !

<lb/>If thou disturb me more I will behead thee

<lb/>with my sharp scimitar, and carry it,

<lb/>my helmet, and my massive mace, on foot.

<lb/>I said: <q>Should any lion come at thee

<lb/>I will encounter it</q> I never said :—

<lb/><q>Rush on me in the night!</q> Leave me to slumber.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then for the third time with his tiger-skin

<pb n="49"/>

<lb/>upon his breast he set himself to sleep.
<lb/>The fearsome dragon roared and, thou hadst said,
<lb/>breathed fire. <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> left the pasturage forthwith,
<lb/>but dared not to approach the paladin.
<lb/>Yet was his heart distracted by his fears
<lb/>for <persName>Rustam</persName> with that dragon, till at length,
<lb/>o’<sic>ermastered</sic> by affection for his lord,
<lb/>he rushed swift as a blast to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s side
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.341"/>
<lb/>and neighed and fretted, pawed upon the ground, 
<lb/>and stamped the earth to pieces with his hoofs.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, wakened from his sweet repose,
<lb/>raged at his docile steed; but now the Maker
<lb/>willed that the dragon should be seen, and <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>perceiving it amid the gloom, unsheathed
<lb/>the keen sword at his girdle, thundered out
<lb/>like spring-clouds, and filled earth with battle-fire.
<lb/>Then said he to the dragon: <q>Tell thy name;
<lb/>earth is no longer thine, yet must not I
<lb/>rob thy dark form of life, thy name untold.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The <sic>laidly</sic> dragon said: <q>None <sic>scapeth</sic> me.
<lb/>For centuries this waste hath been my home,
<lb/>and mine its firmament; no eagle <sic>dareth</sic>
<lb/>to fly across or star to dream thereof.</q>
<lb/>It further said: <q>What is thy name, for she
<lb/>will have to weep that bare thee?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><q>I am <persName>Rustam</persName>,</q>
<lb/>He answered, <q>sprung from <persName>Zal</persName>—the son of Sim—
<lb/>and <placeName>Narwan</placeName> withal. I am myself
<lb/>a host, and trample earth 'neath dauntless <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>.
<lb/>Thou shalt behold my prowess; I will lay
<lb/>thy head in dust.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The dragon closed with him,

<lb/>and in the end escaped not though it strove
<lb/>so fiercely with the elephantine hero
<lb/>that thou hadst said: <q> He will be worsted.</q> <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,

<lb/>on seeing the dragon’s might, and how it battled


<pb n="50"/>

<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName>, laid his ears back, joined the fray,
<lb/>bit at the dragon’s shoulders, tore its hide

<lb/>as though he were a lion, and amazed

<lb/>the valiant paladin, who with keen <sic>glaive</sic>

<lb/>smote off the dragon’s head; blood jetted out

<lb/>in rivers, and its carcase hid the earth.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.342"/>
<lb/>The matchless one, <sic>astonied</sic> at the sight,

<lb/>invoked God’s name and bathed him in the spring.
<lb/>Desiring conquest through God’s strength alone
<lb/>he said: <q>O righteous Judge! me Thou hast given
<lb/>grace, might, and wisdom ; what care I for lion,
<lb/>div, elephant, parched desert, and blue sea ?

<lb/>When I am <sic>wroth</sic> all foes are one to me.</q>

<head>The fourth course: how <persName>Rustam</persName> slew a Witch</head>
<p>


<lb/>Thanksgivings done, he harnessed rose-<sic>cheeked</sic> <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>and mounting came in time where sorcerers dwelt.
<lb/>Long had he fared and saw, as Sol declined,

<lb/>trees, grass, and stream—the very spot for youth.
<lb/>There was a spring as bright as pheasant’s eyes ;
<lb/>beside it were a golden bowl of wine,

<lb/>a roasted mountain-sheep with bread thereon,

<lb/>and salts and sweetmeats. <persName>Rustam</persName> thanked the Lord
<lb/>for showing him a place so opportune,

<lb/>dismounted from his steed, took off the saddle,

<lb/>and marvelled at the loaves and venison.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.343"/>
<lb/>It was a sorcerers' meal, and when he came

<lb/>his voice had caused those <sic>divs</sic> to <sic>disappeay</sic>.

<lb/>He sat beside the rushy stream and brimmed

<lb/>a jewelled cup with wine. A dainty lute

<pb n="51"/>

<lb/>was there, the desert seemed a banquet-hall !
<lb/>He took the lute up, touched the chords, and sang : —

<lg><l>Oh! <persName>Rustam</persName> is an <sic>outeast</sic> still</l>
<l>And hath no days of pleasure,</l>
<l>Marked out for every kind of ill</l>

<l>And not a moment’s leisure.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Be where he may it is his plight</l>
<l>With battle still to harden,</l>
<l>And wilderness and mountain-height</l>
<l>Must serve him for a garden.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>"His <sic>combatings</sic> are never done</l>
<l>And there is no <sic>assuagement</sic>,</l>
<l>'Tis dragon, div, and desert—one</l>
<l>Perpetual engagement !</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The wine and cup, the scented rose,</l>
<l>And where lush herbage <sic>groweth</sic>—</l>
<l>Such things are not at his dispose,</l>
<l>These fortune ne’er <sic>bestoweth</sic></l>
</lg>

<lg>

<l>On one that with the crocodile</l>
<l>Is still engaged in fighting,</l>
<l>Save when the leopard for a while</l>
<l>The combat is inviting.</l>
</lg>

<lb/>the sound of music reached a witch’s ears;

<lb/>she made her cheeks like spring, although by rights
<lb/>she was not fair, and then, perfumed and decked,
<lb/>approached, saluted, and sat down by <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<lb/>who gave God thanks at finding in the desert
<lb/>board, wine, and lute, and youthful boon-companion.
<lb/>Not knowing that she was a wicked witch,

<lb/>an <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> beneath her bravery,

<pb n="52"/>

<lb/>he handed her a cup of wine, invoking
<lb/>the Giver of all good. Now when he named
<lb/>the Lord of love her favour changed ; no soul
<lb/>had she for gratitude, no tongue for praise,
<lb/>but blackened at God’s name, while <persName>Rustam</persName>, flinging
<lb/>his lasso quicker than the wind, ensnared, ;
<lb/>and questioned her: <q> What <sic>artthou</sic>? Speak and show
<lb/>thy proper favour.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>In the lasso’s coils
<lb/>there was a fetid hag all guile and wrinkle,

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<head>The fifth course: How <persName>Rustam</persName> took <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> captive</head>
<p>

<lb/>He journeyed on and reached a place of gloom
<lb/>black as a negro’s face—a murky night

<lb/>without a star or moon; thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>The sun is captive and the stars are <sic>lassoed</sic>!</q>

<lb/>He gave the rein to <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and journeyed on,

<lb/>not seeing height or river for the murk.

<lb/>When he emerged to light he saw a land,

<lb/>like painted silk with crops, where all was verdure
<lb/>and streams; the old world had renewed its youth.
<lb/>His clothes were drenched, and longing for repose
<lb/>he took off his cuirass of tiger-skin,

<lb/>and dripping helm, to dry them in the sun,
<lb/>unbridled <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>, and loosed him in the corn,
<lb/>then, donning his dried helmet and his breastplate,
<lb/>couched like a mighty lion in the grass,

<lb/>his shield his pillow and his hand on hilt.

<lb/>The watchman of the plain, on seeing <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>among the crops, ran up with hue and cry;

<lb/>he smote the hero smartly with a stick

<pb n="53"/>

<lb/>upon the foot and said, as <persName>Rustam</persName> woke :—
<lb/><q>O <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>! why didst thou loose thy steed
<lb/>among the corn to eat where others toiled?</q>
<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName>, angered, seized the watchman’s ears,
<lb/>wrung them and tore them off without a word.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.345"/>
<lb/>The watchman howled and snatched them up, aghast 
<lb/>at <persName>Rustam</persName>. Now <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> was <sic>marchlord</sic> there—
<lb/>a brave and famous youth. To him the watchman
<lb/>went howling with his hands and head all bloody,
<lb/>and ears wrung off, and said: <q>There is a man,
<lb/>like the Black <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>, with leopard-skin cuirass
<lb/>and iron <sic>casque</sic>, a perfect <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>,
<lb/>or else a dragon was asleep in mail!
<lb/>I went to drive his charger from the corn,
<lb/>he would not suffer it but, when he saw me,
<lb/>rose without word, wrung off mine ears, and slept !</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> was hunting there with other nobles,
<lb/>but when he heard the watchman and beheld
<lb/>the Lion’s track in his preserves, they rode
<lb/>toward where the peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> had been seen
<lb/>to find out who he was, and why he served
<lb/>the watchman of the plain so <sic>scurvily</sic>.
<lb/><rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> in threatening wise drew near to <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>who mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>, unsheathed his trenchant sword,
<lb/>and then came onward like a thunder-cloud.
<lb/>As they drew near they questioned one another.
<lb/><q>What is thy name?</q> <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> cried. <q>Who art thou ?
<lb/>Who is thy king and who is backing thee ?
<lb/>Hence is no passage to the warrior-<sic>divs</sic>.
<lb/>Why didst thou tear away the watchman’s ears
<lb/>and turn thy charger loose among the corn?
<lb/>Just so will I make black the world to thee
<lb/>and lay thy helm in dust.</q>


</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.346"/><p>

<lb/><q>My name is <q>Cloud,</q></q><ref target="n.53.1"/>

<lb/>said <persName>Rustam</persName>, <q>if a cloud hath lion’s claws,

<pb n="54"/>

<lb/>with swords and <sic>maces</sic> only for its fruit,
<lb/>and beareth on its lap the heads of chieftains.
<lb/>My real name, should it reach thine ears, would freeze
<lb/>thy life’s breath and heart’s blood. Hast thou not heard
<lb/>of the elephantine warrior’s bow and lasso
<lb/>in every company? We call the mothers
<lb/>of sons like thee shroud-<sic>stitchers</sic>, wailing-women.
<lb/>Thou <sic>comest</sic> thus against me with a troop,
<lb/>but only <sic>throwest</sic> walnuts on a dome.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>With that he drew his baleful Crocodile,
<lb/>hung his coiled lasso to the saddle-bow,
<lb/>came like a lion midst a flock, and slew
<lb/>all that were in his reach. At every stroke
<lb/>he sheared two chieftains' heads and strewed the dust
<lb/>beneath his feet therewith. The troops thus broken
<lb/>fled in dismay, and wilderness and dale
<lb/>were filled with dust-clouds by the cavaliers
<lb/>as they dispersed among the rocks and hollows.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, like an elephant enraged,
<lb/>with sixty coils of lasso on his arm,
<lb/>pressed forward and, when <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> was near <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs>,
<lb/>whose day was darkened, flung his mighty lasso,
<lb/>ensnared that chieftain’s head, and then alighting

<lb/>but gracious just for once and slay me not

<lb/>I will point out to thee the roads and city
<lb/>wherein <persName>Kaus</persName> is bound, the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s dwelling
<lb/>and <rs type="divinity">Bid</rs>’s, since thou hast reassured my heart.
<lb/>Know, O thou worshipful div-hearted hero!

<lb/>That God hath fashioned thee of noble clay!
<lb/>There are between us now and <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>

<lb/>a hundred leagues, O thou of gracious feet !
<lb/>Whence to the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> is another hundred.
<lb/>The road is bad and dangerous, through a gorge—
<lb/>a fearful spot o’er which no eagle <sic>flieth</sic>.

<lb/>There is a cavern midst two hundred others,

<lb/>a wondrous place beyond all measurement,

<lb/>and there twelve thousand warriors, all <sic>divs</sic>,
<lb/>keep watch by night upon the mountain-top ;
<lb/>their captain is <persName>Pulad</persName> son of <rs type="divinity">Ghundi</rs>,

<lb/>while <rs type="divinity">Bid</rs> and <rs type="divinity">Sanja</rs> are their outpost-guards.

<lb/>Of all the <sic>divs</sic> the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> is the chief;

<lb/>at him the mountains shake like willow-leaves,
<lb/>and thou wilt find his person mountain-tall,

<lb/>with shoulders, breast, and neck ten cords across.
<lb/>E’en with such arms and hands and reins as thine,
<lb/>and though thou <sic>brandishest</sic> sword, mace, and spear,
<lb/>and hast such stature, mien, and energy,

<lb/>it is not well for thee to fight that div.

<lb/>Beyond are rocks that no gazelle could pass,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.348"/>
<lb/>and then a river two leagues wide and more 
<lb/>watched by the div in charge of all that province
<lb/>with all the other <sic>divs</sic> at his command.

<lb/>Call it three hundred leagues to the <rs type="ethnic">Narmpai</rs>!
<lb/>From the <rs type="ethnic">Buzgush</rs>, whence to <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>

<lb/>the journey is a foul and tedious one.

<lb/>The words made <persName>Rustam</persName> laugh.

<lb/><q>If thou wilt be my comrade,</q> he replied,
<lb/><q>Thou shalt see how one elephantine chief

<head>The sixth course: <persName>Rustam</persName> fought with the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs></head>
<p>

<lb/>In royal helm and sweat-soaked tiger-skin
<lb/>he sought, intent on fight, the chief <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs>,
<lb/>and shouted in the middle of the host ;
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>The hills and seas are rent !</q>
<lb/>The div <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs> came leaping from the camp
<lb/>at that <sic>tremendotis</sic> shout, while <persName>Rustam</persName> spurring
<lb/>came on him like <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>, grasped boldly
<lb/>his head and ears and neck, then lion-like
<lb/>tore off his head and flung it at his troops.
<lb/>The <sic>divs</sic>' hearts burst in terror at the sight
<lb/>of <persName>Rustam</persName>’s iron mace, and son and sire,
<lb/>forgetting land and crops, went off pell <sic>mell</sic>,
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> drew his vengeful scimitar
<lb/>and cleared the neighbourhood. At set of sun
<lb/>he made all speed back to Mount <placeName>Ispuruz</placeName>,
<lb/>untied <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs>, and, as they sat beneath
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.350"/>
<lb/>the lofty tree, asked how to reach the city 
<lb/>where Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> was, and then hurried on
<lb/>led by <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> afoot. When he arrived
<lb/><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> gave a thundering neigh, which <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>who heard it, understood and told the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>:—
<lb/><q> Our evil days are all but over now;
<lb/>I heard the neigh of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>; it made my heart
<lb/>and spirit young. Thus neighed he in the wars
<lb/>of <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> against the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> king.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The soldiers said: <q>His mind hath gone through hardship,

<lb/>Thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say: <q>He <sic>talketh</sic> in his sleep.</q>

<pb n="58"/>

<lb/>but in these grievous bonds we can do naught;

</p><p>
<lb/>Anon that ardent lover of the fray,

<lb/>and all the noble paladins—<persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName>, gallant <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Bahram</persName> the Lion, <persName>Shidush</persName>,
<lb/>and <persName>Gustaham</persName>—flocked round while <persName>Rustam</persName> wept

<lb/>and asked about his <sic>longsome</sic> toils. <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>embracing him, inquired concerning <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>and all his travail, then said privily :—
<lb/><q>Let not these sorcerers get sight of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>for when the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> is apprised: <q> <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs>

<lb/>the valiant <sic>divs</sic> will gather, earth will <sic>teem</sic>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.351"/>

<lb/>with sword and arrow; holy God may aid thee
<lb/>in bringing to the dust these sorcerers' heads.
<lb/>O’er seven mountains must thou pass, and troops
<lb/>of <sic>divs</sic> throng everywhere. At length a cavern
<lb/>of frightful aspect will appear before thee,
<lb/>a fearsome place, as I have heard: the approach
<lb/>is held by warrior-<sic>divs</sic> equipped like <sic>pards</sic>
<lb/>for fight. That cavern is the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s home:
<lb/>he is the hope and terror of his troops.
<lb/>May’st thou have strength to put an end to him
<lb/>because he is that army’s chief and stay.
<lb/>My soldiers' eyes are blinded by their griefs ;
<lb/>I am in darkness too. Our leeches trust
<lb/>to blood extracted from the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s vitals,
<lb/>in which regard a wise physician said :—
<lb/><q>Let three drops of his blood descend like tears
<lb/>upon the eyes and it will banish blindness.</q></q>
</p><p>

<lb/>He made him ready, and in setting forth

<lb/>for 'tis the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> that I go against—

<lb/>If he shall catch my body with his noose

<lb/>a shameful sorry plight will long be yours,

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<head>The seventh course: how <persName>Rustam</persName> slew the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs></head>
<p>

<lb/>He went girt up—all battle and revenge;

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.352"/>
<lb/>he took <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> and made <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> go like wind. 
<lb/>As soon as <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> had reached the seven mountains,

<lb/>with all their troops of valiant <sic>divs</sic>, the chieftain

<lb/>drew near the abysmal cave, saw them on guard,

<lb/>and spake thus to <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs>: <q>Thou hast been faithful,

<lb/>so now that we must act point out the way.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> made answer : <q> When the sun is hot
<lb/>the <sic>divs</sic> will sleep and thou wilt overcome them ;
<lb/>so bide thy time and thou wilt see no <sic>divs</sic>,

<lb/>except some few on duty, and may’st triumph
<lb/>if He that giveth victory shall aid thee.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>So <persName>Rustam</persName> paused till noon, then, having bound
<lb/><rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> fast with the lasso, mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>unsheathed his warlike Crocodile, and shouted
<lb/>his name like thunder, came like flying dust
<lb/>among the troops, and parted heads from trunks.
<lb/>None sought for glory by withstanding him.
<lb/>Thence radiant as the sun he went to seek
<lb/>the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>, found a pit like Hell, but saw not
<lb/>the sorcerer for the murk. There <sic>swordin</sic> hand

<pb n="60"/>

<lb/>he paused ; no room was there for fight or flight.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.353"/>
<lb/>He rubbed his eyelids, bathed his eyes, and searched
<lb/>the cave till in the gloom he saw a Mountain
<lb/>that blotted all within, with sable face
<lb/>and hair like lion’s mane—a world to see!
<lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName> hasted not to slay the div
<lb/>asleep, but roused him with a leopard’s roar.
<lb/>He charged at <persName>Rustam</persName>, like a gloomy mountain
<lb/>with iron helm and <sic>brassards</sic>, seized a millstone
<lb/>and <sic>drave</sic> at him like smoke. The hero quailed,
<lb/>and thought: <q>Mine end is come!</q> Yet like a lion
</p><p>
<lb/>Enraged he struck full at the div and lopped
<lb/>from that enormous bulk a hand and foot,
<lb/>so mighty was he with his trenchant sword !
<lb/>As '<sic>twere</sic> some lofty-crested elephant
<lb/>and lion in its wrath the maimed div closed
<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName>, and one-footed wrecked the cave.
<lb/>They wrestled, tearing out each other's flesh,
<lb/>till all the ground was puddled with their blood,
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName> thought: <q>If I survive this day
<lb/>I ne’er shall die.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> also thought :—
<lb/><q> Life hath no hopes for me, for, should I scape
<lb/>this <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s claws, maimed as I am and torn,
<lb/>none great or small within <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>will look at me.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Such was his wretched comfort!
<lb/>But still they wrestled, streaming blood and sweat,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.354"/>
<lb/>while elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> in God’s strength
<lb/>strove mightily in anguish and revenge,
<lb/>till sore <sic>bestead</sic>, bold Lion that he was,
<lb/>he reached out, clutched the div, raised him neck-high,

<lb/>and dashed the life-breath from him on the ground,
<lb/>then with a dagger stabbed him to the heart

<pb n="61"/>

<lb/>and plucked the liver from his swarthy form :
<lb/>the carcase filled the cave, and all the world
<lb/>was like a sea of blood.. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> freed
<lb/>Uldd, put back the lasso in the straps,
<lb/>and, giving him the liver of the div
<lb/>to carry, went back to Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.355"/>
<lb/><q>O Lion!</q> said <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs>, <q>thou hast subdued 
<lb/>the world beneath thy sword, and I myself
<lb/>on my bruised body <corr>bear</corr> thy lasso’s marks,
<lb/>so now I hope that thou wilt keep thy promise,
<lb/>for lion-fierceness and a royal mien
<lb/>sort not with broken faith.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><q>I give thee all

<lb/><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,</q> he answered. <q>I have yet
<lb/>long toils before me, many ups and downs,
<lb/>for I must hale its monarch from his throne
<lb/>and fling him in a ditch, behead a myriad

<lb/>and then, it may be, tread the ground again,<ref target="n.61.1"/>
<lb/>but if not I will still keep faith with thee.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>He reached <persName>Kaus</persName> while all in gladness cried :—
<lb/><q>The chief of ardent spirit hath returned !</q>
<lb/>And ran to him with thanks and praise past count.
<lb/>He said: <q>O Shah, thou seeker after knowledge!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.356"/>
<lb/>Rejoice, thy foe is slain. I have ripped out 
<lb/>the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s liver, and his king hath naught
<lb/>to hope from him. What would my lord the Shah ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> blessed <persName>Rustam</persName>. <q>Ne’er may crown and host
<lb/>lack thee,</q> he said. <q>The mother of such offspring
<lb/>must not be mentioned but in terms of praise.
<lb/>Now may a thousand blessings be on <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>and on the country of <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>,
<lb/>because they have produced so brave a chief.
<lb/>In sooth the age hath not beheld thy like,

<pb n="62"/>


<lb/>but brighter still is my lot since I have
<lb/>for liege this lion-slaying Elephant.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>When he had made an end of praise he said :—
<lb/><q>O warrior of <sic>blesséd</sic> steps! now put
<lb/>the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s blood upon mine eyes and those
<lb/>of all my folk; God willing, we may see
<lb/>thy face again.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>They anointed his dim eyes,
<lb/>which grew as bright as Sol, and forthwith <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>anointed all the others with the blood.
<lb/>Their eyes grew bright, and all the world to them
<lb/>a rosary. They hung the crown and set
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> beneath it on an ivory throne
<lb/>as monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, with <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Fariburz</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <persName>Ruhham</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName>, and brave <persName>Bahram</persName>. One week he revelled,
<lb/>the eighth day mounted with his chiefs and troops,
<lb/>who spread themselves like fire among dry reeds
<lb/>throughout the land and plied the massive mace
<lb/>according to the bidding of the Shah.
<lb/>They scorched the realm with their keen <sic>scimitars</sic>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.357"/>

<lb/>and of the warlocks slew so many that blood
<lb/>flowed in a river. When night fell the warriors
<lb/>all rested and <persName>Kaus</persName> proclaimed: <q>The wrong
<lb/>hath been avenged, the <sic>divs</sic> have their deserts,
<lb/>'Tis time to cease from slaughter. Now we need

<lb/>both kind and harsh, inspiring hope and fear,
<lb/>first praising God, the Source of every good,
<lb/><q> Who gave man wisdom, made the turning sky,
<lb/>revealing hardship, cruelty, and love,
<lb/>who gave to us to compass good and ill,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.358"/>
<lb/>If thou art upright and thy Faith is pure 
<lb/>all men will praise thee, but the curse of heaven
<lb/>will fall on thee if ill-disposed and hurtful.
<lb/>If God is just why should His laws be broken ?
<lb/>Observe how He in punishment for sin
<lb/>is sending dust from div and sorcerer !
<lb/>So now if news hath reached thee of their fate,
<lb/>and mind and wisdom are thy monitors,
<lb/>quit thou thy throne and from <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>come, like our other subjects, to our court,
<lb/>and, as thou canst not strive with <persName>Rustam</persName>, pay
<lb/>such tax and tribute as we may demand.
<lb/>Thus haply thou <sic>mayst</sic> still retain thy throne;
<lb/>but if thou wilt not pay despair of life,
<lb/>e’en as the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> and <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs> despaired.</q>

<lb/>The letter done, the Shah affixed his seal
<lb/>of musk and <sic>spicery</sic>, and called <persName>Farhad</persName>—

<lb/>him of the mace of steel, a favourite

<lb/>among the nobles of the land, and one

<lb/>who had not shared the warfare and the toil—
<lb/>to whom he said: <q> Convey to yonder div
<lb/>escaped from bonds this letter of advice.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He kissed the ground, bare the Shah’s letter forth,
<lb/>and reached the valiant horsemen, the <rs type="ethnic">Narmpai</rs>.<ref target="n.63.1"/>
<lb/>the people there with leathern feet appear,

<note xml:id="n.63.1">Cf. p. 55.</note>

<pb n="64"/>

<lb/>hence their nickname <rs type="ethnic">Narmpai</rs> for many a year.
<lb/>There lived among his chiefs and men of war
<lb/>the monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> of yore.
<lb/><persName>Farhad</persName> sent on a man to tell the king
<lb/>of his approach and business, who on hearing :—
<lb/><q>A prudent envoy cometh from the Shah,</q>
<lb/>Sent forward to receive him a great host,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.359"/>
<lb/>selected by the king to show his power,
<lb/>to whom he said: <q>We must make known to-day
<lb/>how great the difference is 'twixt man and div,
<lb/>so act the <sic>pard</sic> and get these sages' leader
<lb/>within your clutches that he may repent
<lb/>himself in terror at the sight of you.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They went forth frowning but their purpose failed.
<lb/>On coming to <persName>Farhad</persName> one of the chiefs—
<lb/>a mighty man—took hold upon his hand,
<lb/>wrung it, and pained him, yet he did not <sic>blench</sic>,
<lb/>or flush. They carried him before the king,
<lb/>who asked about <persName>Kaus</persName> and that long journey,
<lb/>then set the document before a scribe,
<lb/>and sprinkled wine and musk upon the silk.
<lb/>He read the letter to the king who writhed ;
<lb/>but when he heard of <persName>Rustam</persName> and the div
<lb/>blood filled his eyes, his heart throbbed, and he thought :—

</p><p>

<lb/><q>'Tis sunset and night cometh, 'tis the time
<lb/>for rest, but <persName>Rustam</persName> will not let earth rest,
<lb/>his name will always be in evidence.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He mourned <rs type="divinity">Arzhang</rs> and the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>, the slaying
<lb/>of <rs type="divinity">Bid</rs> and of <persName>Pulad</persName> son of <rs type="divinity">Ghundi</rs>,
<lb/>then entertained the envoy for three days
<lb/>among the warriors and men of name,
<lb/>and on the fourth said: <q>Go back to the Shah,
<lb/>that witless youth, and bear to him this answer :—
<lb/><q>Is wine <sic>unmingled</sic> in the cup of fortune?
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.360"/>
<lb/>Am I such that thou <sic>sayest</sic>: <q>Quit thy land,

<lb/>thy throne and country, and attend my court ?</q>

<lb/>My court is more exalted than thine own,

<lb/>mine are a thousand thousand troops and more,

<lb/>and <sic>wheresoe</sic>’er they turn them in the fight

<lb/>they leave not stone or colour or perfume.

<lb/>Prepare thyself forthwith ; I shall be ready;

<lb/>I will lead forth an army lion-like

<lb/>and rouse those heads of yours from their sweet slumbers.

<lb/>I have twelve hundred elephants of war,

<lb/>while thou hast none, and I will send dark dust

<lb/>up from <placeName>Iran</placeName> till hills and vales seem one.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Farhad</persName>, perceiving his defiance, pride,

<lb/>and arrogance, was much concerned to get

<lb/>an answer to the letter, hastened back,

<lb/>and told the Shah what he had seen and heard :—

<lb/><q>The king is higher than heaven and his purpose

<lb/>is not less high. He would not listen to me;

<lb/>the world is nothing worth in his regard.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Thereat <persName>Kaus</persName> called <persName>Rustam</persName> and repeated

<lb/><persName>Farhad</persName>’s report. The Elephantine said :—
<lb/><q>I will relieve our nation from disgrace ;
<lb/>let me bear back this answer: <q>I will draw
<lb/>my trenchant sword.</q> We need a trenchant letter,
<lb/>a message like a thundering cloud. Myself

<lb/>will go to him as envoy; at my words 
<lb/>the rivers shall run blood.</q>

<lb/>The Shah replied :—
<lb/><q>The signet and the crown gain light from thee,
<lb/>who art at once ambassador, bold Tiger,
<lb/>and haughty Lion of the battlefield.</q>

<lb/>With that he called a scribe, whose pen he made
<lb/>an arrowhead, and wrote: <q>Such talk is futile
<lb/>and cometh ill from one of sober sense.

<lb/>If thou canst purge thy head of arrogance

<lb/>do as thou art commanded like a slave.


<pb n="66"/>

<lb/>thou wilt not wreck thy realm but pay me tribute
<lb/>Unvexed by war, enjoy <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,

<lb/>and 'scape with life from <persName>Rustam</persName> ; but if thou
<lb/>Refusest I will march upon thee, stretch

<lb/>my host from sea to sea, and then the soul

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> went on an Embassy to the King of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></head>
<p>



<lb/>The letter sealed, aspiring <persName>Rustam</persName> flung
<lb/>his mace upon the saddle and approached
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.362"/>

<lb/><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, whose monarch heard: <q> <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>hath sent another letter and an envoy—
<lb/>one like a savage lion—with a lasso
<lb/>of sixty coils within the straps. Beneath him
<lb/>there is a speedy charger; one would say :—
<lb/><q>It <sic>bulketh</sic> like a mighty elephant.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/>On hearing this the king selected chiefs
<lb/>and bade them go to meet this savage Lion.
<lb/>As <persName>Rustam</persName> saw them he beheld beside
<lb/>the road a spreading tree, seized on two branches,
<lb/>and twisting round the tree with might and main
<lb/>uprooted it, himself unscathed the while,
<lb/>then poised it like a dart, while all the troops
<lb/>looked on astound. As they came up he hurled
<lb/>the tree, whose boughs hid many cavaliers.
<lb/>One of the chiefest of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>seized <persName>Rustam</persName>’s hand and squeezed it to assay
<lb/>his fortitude in pain, but <persName>Rustam</persName> laughed
<lb/>while all the company looked on in wonder,
<lb/>and as he laughed he crushed the <sic>otheyr</sic>’s hand.
<lb/>That strength-<sic>assayer</sic> lost all strength himself,
<lb/>paled, and fell off his steed. One went before

<pb n="67"/>

<lb/>and told the monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>that which had chanced. There was a cavalier
<lb/>Hight <rs type="divinity">Kalahur</rs>, whose fame rang through the land,
<lb/>and who, like some fierce <sic>pard</sic>, loved fighting only.
<lb/>The king, who mightily esteemed his valour,
<lb/>called him and sent him forth to counter <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.363"/>

<lb/>thus saying: <q> Meet the envoy, give fresh <sic>proots</sic> 
<lb/>of prowess, shame him, make him weep hot tears.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>So <rs type="divinity">Kalahur</rs> came lion-like to <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>with <sic>louring</sic> looks and with a leopard’s greeting,
<lb/>then took and squeezed the Elephantine’s hand
<lb/>till it turned blue with pain, who bore it lightly,
<lb/>as holding manhood’s patent from the sun,
<lb/>and stoutly wrung the hand of <rs type="divinity">Kalahur</rs>,
<lb/>whose nails fell off like leaves. He went and showed
<lb/>the king his mangled hand. <q>I <sic>cannot</sic> hide,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>the anguish that I feel. Enjoy
<lb/>thyself in peace; thou canst not fight this hero.
<lb/>If he is willing let us pay the tribute,
<lb/>submitting to preserve <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>and portion out the tax to great and small
<lb/>to make this heavy travail light; 'tis better
<lb/>than. quaking for our lives.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>

<lb/>that moment came like some fierce elephant
<lb/>before the king who, seeing him, assigned him
<lb/>a place of honour, asked about <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>the host, the travail of the <sic>longsome</sic> road,
<lb/>its ups and downs, and then said: <q>Thou art <persName>Rustam</persName> ;
<lb/>thy breast and arm <sic>befit</sic> a paladin.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He said: <q>I am a slave if fit to serve.
<lb/>Where <persName>Rustam</persName>, that brave paladin, is present
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.364"/>
<lb/>there I am useless. Since God made the world 
<lb/>a chief so eminent hath not appeared,
<lb/>in fight he is a mountain. What and how
<lb/>am I to speak about his mace and <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> ?

<pb n="68"/>

<lb/>what army can withstand him when he <sic>warreth</sic> ?
<lb/>He maketh mountains seas, and seas like mountains.
<lb/>What lion, elephant, or div will raise
<lb/>the battle-cry against him when he <sic>fighteth</sic> ?
<lb/>He is a noble army in himself
<lb/>and not a messenger ; 'twas he that sent me
<lb/>to say: <q>If thou are prudent sow not seed
<lb/>of evil. Thou hast sown it in abundance,
<lb/>and lightly left the path of manliness,
<lb/>how hast thou used the monarch of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>his troops, and paladins in thy revenge ?
<lb/>Thou hast not heard perchance of <persName>Rustam</persName>’s name,
<lb/>who hath the <sic>welkin</sic> for his meanest thrall;
<lb/>but if I had permission from the Shah
<lb/>to come to this thy folk I would not leave
<lb/>one of thy host alive, and thine own head
<lb/>should be upon a spear.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He gave the letter—
<lb/>a message from ambition to self-will—
<lb/>and said: <q> The scimitar is bearing fruit,
<lb/>it beareth on its lap the heads of nobles.</q>

<lb/>The king when he had heard the embassage,
<lb/>and read the letter, was displeased and marvelled.
<lb/>He spake to <persName>Rustam</persName>, saying: <q>To what end
<lb/>are all these frivolous demands of thine ?

<lb/>Say to <persName>Kaus</persName>: <q>Thou art indeed the Shah,

<lb/>but, though thou hast the heart and claws of lions,
<lb/>still I am monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,

<lb/>possess a host, sit on the golden throne,

<lb/>and wear the crown. To summon me absurdly
<lb/>before thee thus is neither right nor royal.

<lb/>Think, and ambition not the thrones of kings,

<lb/>for in the quest dishonour will befall thee.

<lb/>Ride thou Iranward or a lance’s point

<lb/>shall end thy days. If I lead forth my host

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.365"/>

<lb/>Thow lt know not head from foot. 'Tis thy conceit ;

<pb n="69"/>

<lb/>be wise and cast away thy bow, for when
<lb/>we meet thy talk and violence will cease.</q>
<lb/>say too for me to <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>Famous chief!
<lb/>Whatever <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> may give to thee
<lb/>I will bestow a hundred to his one,
<lb/>will make thee chief of chiefs, rich past desire,
<lb/>exalt thy head above the sun and moon,
<lb/>and give to thee command of all my troops.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName>, with his shrewd mind contemplating
<lb/>throne, host, and court, esteemed the king’s speech brainless.

<lb/>Such insults angered him, and he replied :—
<lb/><q>OQ witless king! good sooth thy fortunes <sic>lour</sic>!
<lb/>Hath <persName>Rustam</persName>, that exalted paladin,
<lb/>need of thy treasury and of thy troops ?
<lb/>The son of <persName>Zal</persName> is monarch of <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>
<lb/>and hath no peer; so cease to wag thy tongue
<lb/>or he will pluck it out.</q>

<lb/>The king was <sic>wroth</sic> ;
<lb/>his evil nature turned his thoughts to bloodshed
<lb/>he cried: <q> Arrest the envoy in my presence,
<lb/>Disseat him and behead him.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Instantly
<lb/>an executioner approached the throne
<lb/>to seize his wrists and hale him from his seat,
<lb/>but <persName>Rustam</persName>, roaring like a lion, caught
<lb/>the executioner’s wrists and dragged him close,
<lb/>then flung him down and, holding one foot fast,
<lb/>set his own foot upon the other one

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.366"/>
<lb/>and rent the man asunder! None e’er saw 
<lb/>a sight like that! Then noble <persName>Rustam</persName> cried :—
<lb/><q>If I had but permission from the Shah
<lb/>to war against thine army I would put thee
<lb/>this instant into pitiable plight.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He spake and went forth from the court, his eyes

<lb/>like bowls of blood, while quaking at his words;

<pb n="70"/>

<lb/>and might the king made ready royal gifts

<lb/>of raiment, steeds, and gold, and proffered them
<lb/>to <persName>Rustam</persName>, but he would accept of naught,
<lb/>because such presents would involve disgrace,
<lb/>and left the country of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,

<lb/>concerned at these grave doings. Full of vengeance,
<lb/>and in hot blood, he came before the Shah,
<lb/>told his experience in <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,

<lb/>and said to him: <q>Be not concerned one whit,
<lb/>show courage and prepare to fight the <sic>divs</sic>.

<lb/>I do not value them a single grain

<lb/>of dust, and I will make this mace their bane.</q>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<head>How <persName>Kaus</persName> fought with the King of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></head>
<p>

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> left, the king of sorcerers

<lb/>prepared for war, brought out his tent-enclosure,

<lb/>and led the whole host forth upon the waste ;

<lb/>their dust hid sun and desert, plain and mountain,
<lb/>while earth reeled 'neath the tramp of elephants.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.367"/>

<lb/>He marched like rushing wind. <persName>Kaus</persName> on hearing,
<lb/><q>The <sic>divs</sic>' host is in sight,</q> first ordered <persName>Rustam</persName>

<lb/>to arm for fight and then to <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>,

<lb/>son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, and to <persName>Gurgin</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>,

<lb/>those men of noble lineage, he gave

<lb/>the <sic>arraying</sic> of the host, the ordering

<lb/>of spear and shield. They pitched the camp-enclosures
<lb/>upon the deserts of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>.

<lb/>Upon the right was <persName>Tus</persName>, son of <persName>Naudar</persName>,

<lb/>whose clarion-blasts thrilled to the mountains' hearts ;
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> was on the left wing with <persName>Kishwad</persName>,

<lb/>and clad the heights in iron; <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,

<lb/>in chief command, was posted at the centre.

<lb/>The troops drew up while elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<pb n="71"/>

<lb/>who never saw disaster, led them on.

</p><p>

<lb/><rs type="divinity">Juya</rs>, a noble of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>a fame-<sic>ensuer</sic>, a mace-<sic>brandisher</sic>,
<lb/>and <sic>bragger</sic> likewise, by his monarch’s leave
<lb/>confronted <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, The warrior’s mail
<lb/>shone brilliantly, his <sic>falchion</sic> seared the ground ;
<lb/>he passed along the Iranian line with shouts
<lb/>that plain and mountain echoed: <q>He must send
<lb/>dust up from water who would fight with me.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Not one came out against him, thou wouldst say :—
<lb/><q>Their veins pulsed not with blood.</q> Then cried <persName>Kaus</persName> :— <milestone unit="vullers" n="V.368"/>

<lb/><q>Why hath this div’s voice, valiant warriors !
<lb/>Thus dazed your hearts and made your faces dark ?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They answered not a word, and thou hadst said -—
<lb/><q>The host is withered up before <rs type="divinity">Juya</rs>.</q>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> took the reins and shouldering
<lb/>his shining spear said: <q> Will the Shah permit me
<lb/>to face this <sic>caitiff</sic> div?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q> Be thine the task, for none will seek it else.
<lb/>Go! May the Maker aid thee, be all <sic>divs</sic>
<lb/>and sorcerers thy quarry.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> urged
<lb/>his gallant <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and grasped his weighty spear,
<lb/>came on the scene like some mad elephant,
<lb/>a Pard beneath him and in hand a <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>,
<lb/>sent dust-clouds flying as he wheeled about,
<lb/>and shouting shook the battle-field. <q>O knave!</q>
<lb/>He cried, <q>thy name is cancelled '<sic>mong</sic> the great.
<lb/>This is no time of peace and ease for thee,
<lb/>but pity; she shall weep who bare thee, nurtured,
<lb/>and chastened thee.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><q>Be not too sure,</q> he answered

<lb/><q> About <rs type="divinity">Juya</rs> and his head-reaping sword ;
<lb/>thy mother��s liver shall be split anon,

<pb n="72"/>

<lb/>and she shall wash thy mail and <sic>casque</sic> with tears.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> heard he raised his battle-cry,
<lb/>proclaimed his name, and as he charged appeared
<lb/>a moving mountain, while his foe dismayed
<lb/>wheeled round unwilling to contend with him,
<lb/>but <persName>Rustam</persName> following, swift as dust, and aiming
<lb/>the spearpoint straight against the <sic>girdlestead</sic>,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.369"/>

<lb/>so speared the mail that straps and buckles burst,
<lb/>unseated him, raised him aloft, and turned him
<lb/>like bird on spit,<ref target="n.72.1"/> then flung him down dust-choked,
<lb/>with shivered mail. The warriors of the foe
<lb/>looked on astound, faint-hearted, pale of face,
<lb/>and babble filled the field. Their king commanded
<lb/>the whole host, saying: <q>Lift your heads and fight
<lb/>like leopards in this strife.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The warriors heard
<lb/>his warlike words, and of that countless host
<lb/>a vengeful throng advanced. The Shah perceived it
<lb/>and came on too in orderly array.
<lb/>Both armies drew their swords and closed amid
<lb/>the din of trump and drum, the sky was <sic>ebon</sic>,
<lb/>earth indigo, while swords and <sic>maces</sic> gleamed
<lb/>like lightning flashing from a murky cloud.
<lb/>The air was crimson, black, and violet,
<lb/>with spears and flags. The shouting of the <sic>divs</sic>,
<lb/>the clouds of dust, the roar of kettledrums,
<lb/>and neigh of steeds, rent earth and shook the mountains ;
<lb/>none e’er saw such a fight. Arose the din

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.370"/>

<lb/>of arrow, mace, and sword, the plain became
<lb/>a pool of heroes' blood, earth like a sea
<lb/>of pitch whose waves were <sic>maces</sic>, swords, and arrows.
<lb/>Swift steeds sped on like ships upon the deep,
<lb/>and thou hadst said of them: <q>They founder fast!</q>
<lb/>While <sic>maces</sic> rained upon the <sic>casques</sic> and helms
<note xml:id="n.72.1"> CE. vol. i. p. 386 and note.M</note>

<pb n="73"/>

<lb/>as autumn-blasts shower leaves from willow-trees.
<lb/>Thus for a week those glory-seeking hosts
<lb/>encountered, on the eighth day Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>took from his head the royal <sic>casque</sic> and stood
<lb/>before the Judge and Guide of this world, weeping,
<lb/>then falling prostrate he exclaimed: <q>O Judge

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.371"/>
<lb/>whose word is truth, who <sic>madest</sic> sea and land ! 
<lb/>Give me to quell these <sic>divs</sic> who fear not Thee,
<lb/>and grace for me the throne of king of kings.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He donned his helm and joined his famous troops.
<lb/>There rose a shout and trumpet-blare, the host
<lb/>moved like a mountain. He commanded <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Tus</persName> to bring the <sic>tymbals</sic> to the front.
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> with <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName>, <persName>Gurgin</persName>, all eager for the fray,
<lb/><persName>Gurdza</persName> like a wild boar, with a flag
<lb/>eight <sic>cubits</sic> high, <persName>Farhad</persName>, <persName>Kharrad</persName>, <persName>Barzin</persName>,
<lb/>rushed on the field to seek revenge anew.
<lb/>First, matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> charging on the centre
<lb/>bathed earth with warriors' blood. Upon the right
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> fetched with <persName>Kishwad</persName> arms, drums, troops, baggage,
<lb/>while from the right wing to the left <persName>Giv</persName> fared—
<lb/>a wolf among the sheep. From dawn till sunset
<lb/>blood ran in streams, all looks were fierce and grim,
<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q>The sky is raining <sic>maces</sic>.</q>
<lb/>The slain were heaped on every side, the grass
<lb/>was <sic>smireched</sic> with human brains. The drums and trumpets

<lb/>were like a thunder-clap, an <sic>ebon</sic> veil
<lb/>concealed the sun. Then elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>charged with a mighty power against the quarter
<lb/>where stood the monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.372"/>
<lb/>who with his <sic>divs</sic> and elephants of war 
<lb/>awhile maintained his ground. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> gave
<lb/>his pointed lance to one to hold, invoked

<pb n="74"/>

<lb/>the name of God, raised high his mace, and raged ;
<lb/>his voice filled all the air, the <sic>divs</sic> became
<lb/>dispirited, the elephants confounded ;
<lb/>their trunks were scattered over all the plain,
<lb/>and naught but corpses could be seen for miles.
<lb/>Then calling for a spear he charged the king ;
<lb/>both roared like thunder. When the king beheld
<lb/>the spear of <persName>Rustam</persName> wrath and courage failed,
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName>, seething with revenge, sent up

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.373"/>

<lb/>a mighty lion’s roar, struck the king’s girdle,
<lb/>and pierced him through the mail. The sorcerer
<lb/>turned to a boulder by his magic arts
<lb/>before the Iranian host, while matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>stood in amaze, then shouldered his sharp lance.
<lb/>The Shah came up with drums and elephants,
<lb/>with standards and with troops, and said to <persName>Rustam</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Why tarry here so long, exalted chief!</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>When victorious fortune showed
<lb/>amid the stress the monarch seeing me
<lb/>took up his massive mace, I gave to <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>the rein and speared the monarch through the mail.
<lb/>Methought: <q>Now will he tumble from his saddle.</q>
<lb/>he turned to stone before me, as thou <sic>seest</sic>,
<lb/>and <sic>recketh</sic> not of aught that I can do,
<lb/>but I will carry him to camp, perchance
<lb/>he will resume his shape.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah bade some

<lb/>to bear and set the stone before his tent.
<lb/>Then all the strongest of the host essayed
<lb/>in vain to move the mass, <sic>howbeit</sic> <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>raised it unaided to the troops' amaze,
<lb/>then shouldering the rock walked off therewith
<lb/>with all the people shouting at his back.
<lb/>They praised the Almighty, scattering gems and gold
<lb/>o’er <persName>Rustam</persName> as he bare the stone and threw it
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.374"/>
<lb/>before the tent-enclosure of the Shah.




<pb n="75"/>

<lb/>he set a guard and said: <q> Quit these black arts
<lb/>and <sic>sorceries</sic> to take thy proper shape,
<lb/>or else with this sharp steel and battle-ax
<lb/>will I break up the stone.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The sorcerer heard,
<lb/>the stone dissolved like mist, the king was seen
<lb/>in helmet and cuirass, and <persName>Rustam</persName> seizing
<lb/>his hand turned laughing to the Shah and said :—
<lb/><q> Permit me to present this piece of rock,
<lb/>which feared mine ax and <sic>quaketh</sic> in my grasp.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The Shah on looking saw him not the man
<lb/>for crown and throne; he had a <sic>loathly</sic> face,
<lb/>a lanky shape and boar’s head, neck, and tushes.
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> recalled the past with pain and sighs,
<lb/>then bade a headsman hew the div in pieces,
<lb/>whom matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> taking by the beard
<lb/>Haled from the presence of Kis. They <sic>hewed</sic>
<lb/>the div to pieces as the great king bade.
<lb/>They gathered all the booty from the camp,
<lb/>and put together thrones and crowns and girdles,
<lb/>steeds, jewelry, and arms, The troops attended,
<lb/>and each received according to his <sic>meed</sic>.
<lb/>The impious <sic>divs</sic>, whom all beheld with horror,
<lb/>were then beheaded by the Shah’s command
<lb/>and flung beside the way. He said in prayer :—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.375"/>

<lb/><q>O righteous Judge! Thou hast not left a wish 
<lb/>of mine unsatisfied, hast made me conquer
<lb/>these sorcerers, and revived my hoary fortune.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He spent a week before the Lord in prayer,
<lb/>upon the eighth day <sic>oped</sic> the treasury-door,
<lb/>and gave to all that lacked; another week
<lb/>so passed while every man received his <sic>meed</sic>.
<lb/>The third week still within <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>he called for amber cups and ruby cups,
<lb/>and spent a night in revel. Thus <sic>rethroned</sic>
<lb/>he said to <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>Chief of paladins!

<pb n="76"/>

<lb/>thou hast displayed thy prowess everywhere,
<lb/>and now I have received my throne from thee.
<lb/>Bright be thy heart, thy Faith, and thine allegiance.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> answered: <q> All men have their uses.
<lb/>Whate'er I did was owing to <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs>,
<lb/>my faithful guide, who <sic>hopeth</sic> now to rule
<lb/><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, for so I promised him
<lb/>if he did well. Perchance the king of kings,
<lb/>who <sic>tendereth</sic> <sic>lieges</sic>, will exalt him thus?
<lb/>First let the Shah grant him investiture
<lb/>by solemn covenant and under seal
<lb/>as monarch of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, and then
<lb/>let all the other chieftains do him homage,
<lb/>he will approve himself thy faithful liege
<lb/>and send to thee the tribute that is due.</q>
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing what his servant said,
<lb/>assented, summoned from <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>the chiefs, and said in speaking of <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> :-—
<lb/><q>Do as he <sic>counselleth</sic> and bear no grudge.</q>
<lb/>He gave <rs type="divinity">Ulad</rs> a special robe of honour,
<lb/>and said: <q>Good <sic>worketh</sic> constantly unseen,</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.376"/>

<lb/>The world grew young through him, and there arose

<lb/>Upon that chief—the Light of earth—the Shah

<lb/>so that thenceforth none else should have the throne,

<lb/>and blessed him, saying: <q>May none see sun and moon

<lb/>and be thy soul fulfilled with love and kindness.</q>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> leaped down, kissed the throne, made ready

<lb/>the Shah remained, <sic>illumining</sic> the world

<lb/>None thought of death, the earth grew full of verdure—

<lb/>and rich by justice and security ;
<lb/>the hand of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> was stayed from ill,
<lb/>and day and night the fruits and foliage
<lb/>invoked a blessing on the crown and throne :—

<lb/>All wondered that he should achieve such greatness,

<p><persName>Kaus</persName> makes a progress through his realm. He wars against the kings of <placeName>Barbar</placeName>, <placeName>Misr</placeName>, and <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>; he marries <persName>Sudaba</persName>, the daughter of the king of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>, and through treachery is taken captive by him. On this the <rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs> and <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> both invade <placeName>Iran</placeName> and fight for its possession. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> in despair appeal to <persName>Rustam</persName>, who rescues <persName>Kai <persName>Kaus</persName></persName>, defeats <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, and reinstates the Shah, who, warned by past experience, rules justly for a time, rises to the height of his power, and builds himself great palaces on Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName>. Afterward he falls again into temptation, tries to mount to heaven, is rescued again by <persName>Rustam</persName>, again repents, and again is restored to power.

</div>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p>$§ 1-6. In the accounts of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>' two expeditions to Barbaristan we have a duplication of tradition. The late Professor <persName>Darmesteter</persName> has thrown considerable light on that obscure subject, <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s geography in this part of the poem.<ref target="n.79.1"/> There are several Barbars, and he points out that the one here intended is the <placeName>Berbera</placeName> nearly opposite <placeName>Aden</placeName> in the British Somali Coast Protectorate. It is the Pun-t of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, and was then and is still a great trading station. When the south-west monsoon changes into the north-east wind thousands of traffickers begin to arrive, and the place is kept busy from October to April. Further, he points out with regard to <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> that it is a form of the word <placeName>Himyar</placeName>, which is another name for <placeName>Yaman</placeName>. We may therefore conclude that <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s notion was

 

<note xml:id="n.79.1">DEI, ii. 221-224.</note>

<pb n="80"/>

that <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> marched from <placeName>Nimruz</placeName> to the sea-coast of <placeName>Makran</placeName> (Baluchistan), there built his fleet, sailed past the southern shores of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, and reached some spot north of <placeName>Berbera</placeName> on the western shore of the <placeName>Red Sea</placeName>. He would then, as <persName>Firdausi</persName> says, have <placeName>Misr</placeName> (<placeName>Egypt</placeName>) on his left hand, <placeName>Barbar</placeName> on his right, and the sea between him and his objective <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> (<placeName>Yaman</placeName>), which confronted him across it, The matter has become confused from the fact that <persName>Firdausi</persName> had just stated that the people of <placeName>Misr</placeName> and <persName>Sham</persName> (<placeName>Syria</placeName>) had rebelled against <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, and therefore <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> has been assumed to mean <placeName>Syria</placeName>. We may add that the two historians Tabari and Mas’<sic>tidi</sic> both mention <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>' expedition to <placeName>Yaman</placeName>, and so far, though their accounts differ considerably from <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s, support Professor <persName>Darmesteter</persName>’s elucidation of this episode.<ref target="n.80.1"/></p>

<p>The matter has been further confused by <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s use of the word <q><placeName>Zirih</placeName></q> in this part of his work. The word is usually employed in connexion with the lakes and swamps of <placeName>Sistan</placeName>, which formally were much more extensive.<ref target="n.80.2"/> The word, however, is merely an older (Pahlavi) form of the modern Persian <q><sic>darya</sic>,</q> a sea, lake, or river. It has come, however, to be regarded as a proper name, and such an expression as <q>the sea of <placeName>Zirih</placeName></q> is not only <sic>tantological</sic> but distinctly misleading. We translate <q> <placeName>Zirih</placeName></q> sea. The expedition of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> looks like an attempt to capture an ancient trade-route.</p>

<p>The marriage of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> with the daughter of the king of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> is the cause of serious trouble later on, as will appear in Part IV.</p>

<p>The reference to <placeName>Syria</placeName> and a certain similarity of circumstance suggest that in the account of the treacherous capture of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> by the king of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> we have a distorted historical reminiscence of the overthrow of Antiochus Sidetes in the early spring of B.C, 128 or 129. Mithridates I., in the course of a reign of <sic>thirtyeight</sic> years (B.c. 174-136), had extended the narrow bounds of the Parthian kingdom both eastward and westward, to the <placeName>Hindu Kush</placeName> and to the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName> respectively. Westward the increase had taken place at the expense of the Seleucid kingdom of <placeName>Syria</placeName>. The successor of Mithridates—Phraates I].—made no attempt to enlarge his empire, but the king of <placeName>Syria</placeName>—Antiochus Sidetes— took the first opportunity to attempt to recover the provinces of which he had been deprived by Mithridates. He led a large and splendidly equipped host into <placeName>Babylonia</placeName> and thrice defeated Phraates II., who, though worsted, was not conquered, and still maintained himself with an army in the country. The three great cities of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, <placeName>Seleucia</placeName>, and <placeName>Ctesiphon</placeName>, however, fell into the hands of

the Syrians. Winter came on, and Antiochus Sidetes, resolved to maintain his advantage, distributed his forces throughout the cities and towns of <placeName>Babylonia</placeName> with the intention of renewing operations in the spring. The Syrian troops with their motley entourage of camp-followers, cooks, actors, etc., soon made themselves intolerable to the natives among and upon whom they were quartered. An understanding was entered into with Phraates II, who promised to be at hand with his army, and at a given signal the Syrian invaders, who were thoroughly enjoying themselves after their campaign and had been kept wholly ignorant of the impending danger, were attacked throughout <placeName>Babylonia</placeName>, and either massacred or taken captive. Antiochus Sidetes himself perished, his son Seleucus was taken prisoner and his niece as well, whom Phraates II. married.<ref target="n.81.1"/></p>

<p>§§ 4 and 7. In the account of the invasion of <placeName>Iran</placeName> by the <rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs> during the captivity of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> in <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>, and their defeat by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, we seem to have a reference to the invasions and conflicts that were actually going on during the period when the Zandavasta was being compiled or reconstructed, i.e. during the third century after the Christian era.<ref target="n.81.2"/> In the Zandavasta we read : <q>We sacrifice unto the awful kingly <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Glory</rs></rs></rs>, made by Mazda . . .

<p>In the greater Bundahish we read: <q> There was a fiend called <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Zinigav</rs></rs></rs> who had poison in his eye: he had come from the country of the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs></rs></rs> to reign on <placeName>Iran</placeName>-Shahr: any man he gazed at with his evil eye, he killed. The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></rs> called <persName>Frasyav</persName> into their country, he killed that <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Zinigav</rs></rs></rs>.</q><ref target="n.81.4"/> In the Bundahish <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Zinigav</rs></rs></rs> is said to have been the grandfather of <persName>Zahhak</persName>,<ref target="n.81.5"/> the great protagonist of the <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> race in the <persName>Shahnama</persName>.® The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></rs>, when they had to choose between the <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs> and the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs></rs></rs>, preferred the former.

<p>§§ 8-10. We are told in the Dinkard that <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> built himself seven dwellings on Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName>, one of gold, two of silver, two of steel, and two of crystal, that he warred against the <sic>divs</sic> of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> and fell into a trap which they laid to destroy him.

<lb/>We have received it both from <sic>archimage</sic>

<lb/>and ancient bard of rustic lineage

<lb/>that afterward <persName>Kaus</persName> resolved to make

<lb/>a progress through his kingdom. From <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>he journeyed to <placeName>Turan</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>, and after
<lb/>passed to <placeName>Makran</placeName>, and thence down to the sea
<lb/>in state ; men’s waists knew neither belt nor buckle.
<lb/>The chiefs all paid their tribute and their dues,
<lb/>the Ox took care not to provoke the Lion.
<lb/>Thence to <placeName>Barbar</placeName> they went—a brilliant throng
<lb/>with crown and diadem, intent on conquest.

<lb/>the monarch of <placeName>Barbar</placeName> prepared for war,
<lb/>and matters changed their hue. A host came forth
<lb/>and stayed the revels of the great king’s troops,
<lb/>the elephants were hidden by the dust,
<lb/>men saw not hand or rein. The hosts encountered
<lb/>like mighty waves. <persName>Gudarz</persName> beholding this
<lb/>'Took from the saddle-bow his mighty mace,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.380"/>
<lb/>urged on his steed and, with a thousand warriors 
<lb/>with javelins and with breastplate-piercing arrows,
<lb/>closed with and brake the centre of the foe.
<lb/>Behind him charged the Shah, thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>There is not left a cavalier or spearman
<lb/>within <placeName>Barbar</placeName>.</q> The elders of the country,
<lb/>on seeing that the blast of war had passed,
<lb/>came to <persName>Kaus</persName>, heart-broken, to seek peace,
<lb/>and said: <q> We are thy slaves and bow our necks
<lb/>to tribute; we will pay in gold and jewels
<lb/>instead of <sic>drachms</sic>, and earn thy <sic>treasurev</sic>’s praise.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> received them graciously and taught them
<lb/>new laws and ways. Anon the sound of bells
<lb/>and cymbals rose with shouts and clarion-blare,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.381"/>
<lb/>and he departed westward toward Mount <placeName>Kaf</placeName>. 
<lb/>The people when they heard about the Shah
<lb/>came forth to him and proffered fealty,
<lb/>while all the great men went to welcome him,
<lb/>and laid a heavy tribute on themselves.
<lb/>When men performed his will with due submission
<lb/>he and his host passed by and hurt them not.
<lb/>He led the army to <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>
<lb/>as <persName>Rustam</persName>’s guests and <sic>tarried</sic> there a month
<lb/>with hawk and cheetah, song and <sic>minstrelsy</sic>.

</p><p>

<lb/>Ere long a bramble grew among the roses.
<lb/>To meet with trials is the lot of all,
<lb/>and he that <sic>mounteth</sic> must expect a fall.
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs> rose when all seemed going well,

<pb n="84"/>

<lb/>a wealthy and aspiring man of parts
<lb/>set up his standard both in <placeName>Misr</placeName> and <persName>Sham</persName>,
<lb/>the people turned away from <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>renouncing fealty, who when he heard
<lb/>bade the drums sound and marched forth from <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>
<lb/>light-heartedly, the soldiers wrote his name
<lb/>upon their shields, their swords shook in their scabbards.
<lb/>Unnoticed by the foe he led his host
<lb/>down to the sea, built ships of war and transports
<lb/>beyond compute, embarked the host and sailed
<lb/>a thousand leagues as thou wouldst count on land

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.382"/>

<lb/>till he arrived to win his own again
<lb/>where three states met—<placeName>Misr</placeName> on his left; <placeName>Barbar</placeName>
<lb/>upon his right; 'twixt him and his objective
<lb/>Hamivaran, which fronted him, the sea.
<lb/>Each had a mighty host. News came to them :—
<lb/><q> <persName>Kaus</persName> hath crossed the water with his troops.</q>
<lb/>The three conferred, their troops met at <placeName>Barbar</placeName>—
<lb/>an army such that desert, sea, and mountain
<lb/>were all <sic>aweary</sic> of the horses' hoofs.
<lb/>There was no room left for the ravening lion,
<lb/>or path for <sic>onager</sic> across the plains;
<lb/>the fish in water and the <sic>pard</sic> on rock,
<lb/>the cloud and flying eagle in the air,
<lb/>sought passage, but what passage could there be
<lb/>for wild things in a region so bested ?

</p><p>
<lb/>Now when <persName>Kaus</persName> had disembarked his host
<lb/>one saw not plain or mount. <q>The world is mailed,</q>
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said, <q>each spearpoint is a star!</q>
<lb/>What with the golden helms and golden shields,
<lb/>and glittering axes borne upon the shoulder,
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>The earth is running gold,
<lb/>and Indian <sic>scimitars</sic> are raining souls.</q>
<lb/>The army’s dust made heaven like <sic>sandarach</sic>,
<lb/>the whole world turned as black as ebony,

<pb n="85"/>

<lb/>the mountains shivered at the trumpets' blast,
<lb/>and earth was bent beneath the horses' hoofs,
<lb/>the din of <sic>tymbals</sic> would have made thee say :—
<lb/><q> Earth is one camp.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>When from the Iranian host
<lb/>the trump and drum were heard <persName>Bahram</persName>, <persName>Gurgin</persName>,
<lb/>and <persName>Tus</persName> came forth and, where <persName>Gudarz</persName> was stationed,

<lb/><persName>Shidush</persName>, Farhid, and <persName>Giv</persName> let fall their reins, 
<lb/>and steeped the heads of all their spears in bane.
<lb/>The horsemen bent upon the <sic>saddlebow</sic>,
<lb/>and shout and crash of battle-ax were heard ;
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>They quarry stone and iron,
<lb/>or dash down heaven to earth.</q> When at the centre
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> advanced, and host encountered host,
<lb/>the eyes of men grew dim, vermilion rained
<lb/>on <sic>lapislazuli</sic>, and thou hadst said :-—
<lb/><q>The air is hailing and is planting tulips
<lb/>among the rocks.</q> The javelins' eyes flashed fire,
<lb/>and earth became as '<sic>twere</sic> a sea of blood.
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> so dismayed the three allies
<lb/>that end and middle were all one to them.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.384"/>
<lb/>The monarch of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> was first 
<lb/>to drop the scimitar and massive mace,
<lb/>saw that the day was lost and sorrowing sought
<lb/>peace with the Shah, agreeing to send tribute,
<lb/>steeds, implements of war, and thrones and crowns,
<lb/>provided that <persName>Kaus</persName>, when all was paid,
<lb/>should go and keep his troops from harrying.
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> replied: <q>I grant you all protection.
<lb/>Seek not my crown and throne.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He then marched back

<lb/>well pleased to camp, and from <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>
<lb/>an envoy brought him treasures, stores of arms,
<lb/>with emeralds and other gems and said :—
<lb/><q>OQ just and mighty lord! we chiefs and commons

<lb/>and furnished forth his lips with courtesies.
<lb/>He gave that monarch greeting from <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>then did the embassage, which pained the king,
<lb/>who thought: <q>Though he be king of kings and <sic>worldlord</sic>

<lb/>victorious and obeyed, I have no daughter
<lb/>but this, and she is dearer than sweet life ;
<lb/>yet if I slight and spurn this messenger

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.386"/>
<lb/>I <sic>cannot</sic> fight. 'Tis best to shut mine eyes 
<lb/>to this affliction and repress my wrath.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He answered that fair-spoken envoy thus :—
<lb/><q> He <sic>asketh</sic> of me much—two things unequalled
<lb/>in preciousness; my wealth is my support,
<lb/>my child my treasure; being robbed of her
<lb/>my very heart is gone, yet I resign them
<lb/>and yield to his request.</q>

<lb/>He called Suidaba,

<lb/>and full of sorrow spake thus of <persName>Kaus</persName> :—
<lb/><q> A courteous envoy hath arrived and brought
<lb/>a letter from that mighty lord, who <sic>lacketh</sic>
<lb/>naught that is great and good, to this effect :—
<lb/>he would deprive me, though I wish it not,
<lb/>of heart-repose and all my peace of mind.
<lb/>What dost thou say now? What is thine own wish ?
<lb/>What is thy shrewd decision in this case?</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>Sudadba answered: <q>If this must be so
<lb/>there is no need to sup on grief to-day.
<lb/>Why grieve at union with the king of earth,

<pb n="88"/>

<lb/>who can deprive the mighty of their lands ?
<lb/>This is not grief but joy.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The king perceived

<lb/>that she was not unwilling, called the envoy,
<lb/>and gave him the chief place. They made a compact,
<lb/>each with the rites and sanctions then obtaining.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.387"/>
<lb/>The broken-hearted monarch and his chiefs
<lb/>were busied for a week, and then brought forth
<lb/>two scores of litters and three hundred slaves,
<lb/>a thousand each of camels, steeds, and mules,
<lb/>whose loads were of dinars and of brocade,
<lb/>and 'neath the <sic>haudahs</sic> hung embroidered trappings.
<lb/>An escort was drawn up in long defile;
<lb/>the New Moon graced one litter; following her
<lb/>there came her marriage-portion, then the escort
<lb/>arrayed like Paradise; thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>The heaven hath planted tulips in the earth!</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Now when that fair-faced troop and Heart’s Delight
<lb/>approached the presence of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>a New Moon issued from the <sic>haudah</sic> like
<lb/>a new-<sic>throned</sic> monarch robed. There musk and rose
<lb/>contrasted, and the earrings hung on <sic>civet</sic>;
<lb/>eyes languished, cheeks were ruby-red, and eyebrows
<lb/>sprang from a column like a <sic>silvern</sic> reed.
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> in rapt amaze invoked God’s name,
<lb/>he called the hoary, shrewd, and wise <sic>archmages</sic>,
<lb/>and having judged her fit to be his consort
<lb/>he sanctioned his desires with legal rites.
<lb/><q>I knew thee at first sight,</q> he told his spouse,
<lb/><q>Fit to adorn mine Idols' golden house.</q>

<lb/>Meanwhile the father grieved and sought a cure;
<lb/>so eight days afterward he sent at dawn

<pb n="89"/>

<lb/>a messenger to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> to say :—

<lb/><q>If now the Shah will be mine honoured guest
<lb/>the people of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> will be

<lb/>much honoured too when they behold his face.</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.388"/><p>
<lb/>In this wise sought he to entrap <persName>Kaus</persName>, 
<lb/>and being bad of heart and shrewd of wit,
<lb/>thought to retain his kingdom and his child,

<lb/>and to escape all tribute. Now <persName>Sudaba</persName>

<lb/>knew that her sire meant outrage at a feast,
<lb/>and said to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>: <q>This is not well.

<lb/>Thou must not be his guest, lest at the banquet
<lb/>he make a brawl and get thee in his clutches.
<lb/>All this ado is made on mine account,

<lb/>and must result in thy discomfiture.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He heeded not her words because he held
<lb/>her people feeble folk, and as a guest
<lb/>went with his warriors and mighty men.

<lb/>The ruler of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> possessed

<lb/>a pleasure-city, <placeName>Shaha</placeName> <sic>hight</sic>, and had

<lb/>a residence therein. He decked the city

<lb/>throughout, and when the exalted Shah arrived

<lb/>the citizens all did him reverence,

<lb/>showered gems and saffron, mingled <sic>ambergris</sic>

<lb/>with musk, and wove the sounds of harp and song
<lb/>like warp and woof. The monarch and his nobles
<lb/>Descrying Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> approached on foot.

<lb/>The palace from the gateway to the hall

<lb/>rained jewels, pearls, and gold; men poured them forth
<lb/>from golden trays and sifted <sic>ambergris</sic>

<lb/>and musk o’<sic>erhead</sic>. The king set up a throne

<lb/>of gold within the palace and <persName>Kaus</persName>

<lb/>sat there in joy. He revelled for a week;

<lb/>the place delighted and enchanted him.

<lb/>The monarch of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> stood girded—

<lb/>a subject in his presence day and night—


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.389"/>
<lb/>with all his troops to serve the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> 


<pb n="90"/>

<lb/>till each felt safe, and all suspicion ceased ;

<lb/>but when the week was o’er their hosts were ready

<lb/>and rose; the soldiers of Barbaristan

<lb/>had been apprised and were upon the march:

<lb/>such was the plot. Their advent <sic>joyed</sic> the king.

<lb/>At night came sound of trumpet and assault

<lb/>when no Iranian was prepared for fight.

<lb/>Forthwith the forces of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>

<lb/>seized on <persName>Kaus</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>,

<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> and <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>,

<lb/>and all the other famous warriors ;

<lb/>these they took captive and bound fast in bonds,

<lb/>and throne and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> were <sic>shent</sic> ! What saith the man

<lb/>of insight and O sage: what <sic>thinkest</sic> thou ?

<lb/><q>Trust in another man is not secure

<lb/>without the tie of blood to make it sure,

<lb/>and even one so bound to thee may turn

<lb/>his face away and thine affection spurn,

<lb/>if then another’s love thou fain wouldst try

<lb/>prove it in weal and in adversity,

<lb/>for if in rank thou art more high than he

<lb/>then envy will abate his love for thee,

<lb/>the course of this pernicious world is so,

<lb/>it lightly <sic>changeth</sic> with all winds that blow.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> was ta’en; his over-confidence

<lb/>achieved the purpose of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>.

<lb/>There was a mountain with a cloud-capt head,

<lb/>which God had lifted from the ocean-depths,

<lb/>and on the mountain-top a fortress rose ;

<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>The sky is in its lap.</q>

<lb/>'Twas thither that the monarch sent <persName>Kaus</persName>,

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, and <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Tus</persName>; the other chiefs

<lb/>he flung inside that stronghold with the Shah

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.390"/>
<lb/>bound. Over it a thousand warriors,

<lb/>all swordsmen of renown, kept watch. He gave

<lb/>the camp-enclosure of <persName>Kaus</persName> to spoil,

<pb n="91"/>

<lb/>bestowing on his own chiefs crowns and purses.

<lb/>Two files of ladies with a covered litter

<lb/>between them were deputed to escort

<lb/>Sudiba home and trampled on the tents.

<lb/>Now when <persName>Sudaba</persName> saw the ladies come

<lb/>she rent her royal raiment and plucked out

<lb/>her musky tresses. With her filbert-nails

<lb/>she stained her rosy cheeks the hue of blood,

<lb/>exclaiming thus: <q>Men that are men indeed

<lb/>hold in contempt such tricks and outrages.

<lb/>Ye should have bound him on the day of battle

<lb/>what time his robe was mail, his throne a steed,

<lb/>and chieftains such as <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Tus</persName>

<lb/>rent with their drums your hearts. Ye make the throne

<lb/>of gold an <sic>ambuscade</sic> and break your faith.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>She called the servants <q> dogs,</q> her jasmine-skin
<lb/>was <sic>smirched</sic> with blood, she did not spare her words. 
<lb/>She said: <q>I will not part with <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>
<lb/>although he shall be hidden in the dust,

<lb/>and, since he needs must drag his chain, behead me
<lb/>all guiltless as I am.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>They told her sire,
<lb/>who was enraged and, eager for revenge,
<lb/>dispatched her to his fortress, broken-hearted
<lb/>with blood-stained cheeks to join her husband there.
<lb/>Thenceforth she sat in sorrow with the king
<lb/>engaged in tending him and comforting.

<lb/>when they arrived 'twas <sic>bruited</sic> through the realm :—

<lb/><q>The Cypress-tree is missing from the garden,

</p><p>
<lb/>Now when men saw the golden throne left void
<lb/>they all desired the crown; upon each side

<lb/>approached, cries rose from both sides of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and peace was changed to strife. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>joined battle fiercely with the Arabian host;
<lb/>they fought three months, and many heads were lost

</p><p>
<lb/>It is the custom of this Wayside Inn

<lb/>The people said: <q> Our fortunes are o’<sic>erturned</sic>,

<lb/>Woe for <placeName>Iran</placeName>, for it is desolate,

<lb/>An <sic>archmage</sic> went to him and told the tidings,

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> sent a wary messenger
<lb/>to make his way to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> and say :—
<lb/><q>I am approaching with a mighty host
<lb/>to fight the ruler of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>.
<lb/>Be glad of heart and feed not on thy grief:
<lb/>behold! I am already in the land.</q>

<lb/>Withal a man of name among the chiefs
<lb/>went to the ruler of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>,
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName> wrote to him in warlike terms
<lb/>a letter all mace, scimitar, and fray:
<lb/><q> Thou hast entrapped our Shah and broken faith.
<lb/>It is not manly to use guile in war,
<lb/>nor art thou dour like the bold crocodile
<lb/>which never <sic>ambuscadeth</sic> in the fight

<lb/>Thou shalt escape the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s evil clutch
<lb/>if Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> be set at large; if not,
<lb/>prepare thyself to feel my weight in battle.
<lb/>Thou surely must have heard the chieftains tell
<lb/>of how I fought against <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>fought with <persName>Pulad</persName> son of <rs type="divinity">Ghundi</rs> and <rs type="divinity">Bid</rs>,
<lb/>and smote the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>.</q>

 

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.394"/><p>

<lb/>As he read the letter
<lb/>the king turned dizzy, and the world grew dark
<lb/>before his eyes. He answered: <q> <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>
<lb/>shall never set foot on the plain, and when
<lb/>thou <sic>comest</sic> to Barbaristan, and all
<lb/>thy cavaliers have fled, a chain and pit
<lb/>are ready for thee too. If these delights




<pb n="94"/>

<lb/>allure thee I, according to our custom,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.395"/>
<lb/>will meet thee with my troops.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> heard

<lb/>the answer, and the chieftains had assembled,
<lb/>the trumpets sounded and he mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>.
<lb/>He went by sea because the way by land
<lb/>was tedious, crossing to <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>
<lb/>with all his mighty host in ships and transports.
<lb/>The troops were ready both to spoil and slay,
<lb/>and banished all compunction from their hearts.

</p><p>
<lb/>Now when the monarch of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>
<lb/>had news of vengeful <persName>Rustam</persName> and his host
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.396"/>
<lb/>he raged, the war-cry rose, and all the world
<lb/>seethed up in blood and pillage. <persName>Rustam</persName> donned
<lb/>his armour, mounted on the snorting <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>and shouldering his mace charged furiously.
<lb/>Whenas the <sic>foemen</sic> saw his chest and arms,
<lb/>and how he handled mace and battle-ax,
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>They have no hearts at all.</q>

<lb/>They scattered in their fear of him, and thus
<lb/>that great host fled back to <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>.
<lb/>The king in conclave summoned two young men
<lb/>in order to dispatch them to <placeName>Barbar</placeName>
<lb/>and <placeName>Misr</placeName>, like rushing wind, each with a letter
<lb/>penned in distress of heart with blood for ink,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.397"/>
<lb/>and thus it ran: <q>Our realms confine, we share
<lb/>in good and evil, and in fight and feast.
<lb/>If ye will join with me I fear not <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>in fight ; if not, the evil will extend,
<lb/>and evil’s hand <sic>extendeth</sic> on all sides.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Whenas the letter reached the kings, announcing
<lb/>that <persName>Rustam</persName> led his host across the desert,
<lb/>they feared, <sic>bestirred</sic> themselves, arrayed their powers
<lb/>and marched toward <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>. The land
<lb/>became all hill, troops stretched from range to range,

<pb n="95"/>

<lb/>and dust obscured the moon. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> sent
<lb/>a warrior in haste to Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>by stealth to say: <q>The monarchs of three realms
<lb/>approach to fight—brave men who shall not know
<lb/>their heads from feet when I encounter them ;
<lb/>but thou must not be injured by our strife
<lb/>since evil men are prone. to outrages,
<lb/>and e’en <placeName>Barbar</placeName>’s throne would avail me not
<lb/>if ill befell the person of the Shah.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> made answer: <q> Have no care for this;
<lb/>the earth was not spread out for me alone,
<lb/>and bane will mix with sweets and love with hate
<lb/>while heaven <sic>turneth</sic>. God too is my friend,
<lb/>my refuge, and my stronghold is His love.
<lb/>Give <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> the rein, and level to his ears

<lb/>Matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> heard,

<lb/>then stood alone and glared upon the foe,
<lb/>but no one dared though <persName>Rustam</persName> waited long,
<lb/>until bright Sol was setting in the sea,
<lb/>and dark-<sic>hued</sic> night was coming on apace.
<lb/>Then that great elephantine chief returned,

<lb/>contributed a hundred more—huge beasts—
<lb/>and had a line of battle two miles long,
<lb/>and thirdly was arrayed the power of <placeName>Misr</placeName>.
<lb/>The atmosphere was darkened, earth was hidden,
<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q>The world is all of iron,</q>
<lb/>Or: <q>Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName> hath donned a coat of mail.</q>
<lb/>Behind the warriors' backs amid the dust
<lb/>waved flags of yellow, red, and violet ;
<lb/>the mountains echoed with the heroes' shouts,
<lb/>Aud earth was weary of the tramp of steeds.
<lb/>Then were the claws and hearts of lions rent,
<lb/>and lusty eagles flung their plumes away,

(Thou wouldst have said the lasso crushed his waist),

<lb/>then snatched him from the saddle, like a ball

<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> made fast his hands. They captured sixty

<lb/>to bitterness. On both sides many fell,
<lb/>the age grew conversant with good and evil,

</p><p>
<lb/>The envoy
<lb/>spurred forth toward Barbaristan, the Shah
<lb/>received the letter couched in such fair terms,
<lb/>then wrote a letter to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Quit thou <placeName>Iran</placeName> and limit thine ambition.
<lb/>I wonder much at what I hear of thee.
<lb/>Thou hast no wants, thou <sic>joyest</sic> in <placeName>Turan</placeName>;
<lb/>then be not covetous or fondly grasping
<lb/>at ill, which soon will bring thee lengthy toils,
<lb/>a smaller matter is enough for thee—
<lb/>to save thy skin. Dost know not that <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>is my seat, earth all mine? The boldest leopard
<lb/>will never dare to face the lion’s claws.</q>


</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.405"/><p>
<lb/>He gave a paladin the letter sealed, 

<lb/>who reached the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>in haste, first kissed the ground and did obeisance,
<lb/>and after compliments gave him the letter
<lb/>which, when <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had read it, filled
<lb/>his head with vengeance and his heart with rage.
<lb/>He answered: <q>Only miscreants talk thus.
<lb/>In thy case, if <placeName>Iran</placeName> had satisfied thee
<lb/>thou hadst not coveted <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>,
<lb/>and now that I have won <placeName>Iran</placeName>, and raised
<lb/>my fluttering flag, that broad <sic>champaign</sic> is mine
<lb/>on two accounts; thou needs must hear the truth:
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.406"/>
<lb/>first—I inherit all the land from <persName>Tur</persName>, 
<lb/>my grandsire and the son of <persName>Faridun</persName>;
<lb/>and secondly—I cleared it of the <rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs>
<lb/>with my sword-arm. I with my scimitar

<pb n="100"/>

<lb/>behead the mountains and bring eagles down
<lb/>from their dark cloud-tops.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He equipped his troops,
<lb/>and marched in person to oppose <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>who, when he heard, arrayed a boundless host
<lb/>and from <placeName>Barbar</placeName> marched to <placeName>Arabia</placeName>
<lb/>to meet <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>; the world was filled
<lb/>with trump and <sic>tymbal</sic>-din, the sky was ebony,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.407"/>
<lb/>the earth was iron. What with crash of ax
<lb/>and twang of bow a blood-wave swept the field,
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> thundering from the centre broke
<lb/>the <sic>foemen</sic> with one charge. On that field slept
<lb/>the fortunes of <placeName>Turan</placeName>. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>boiled, like fermenting must, without a fire,
<lb/>and cried: <q>O gallant hearts of mine, my Lions,
<lb/>and chosen chiefs! 'twas for a time like this
<lb/>that ye were reared upon my breast, and now
<lb/>ye play at battle with mine <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> foes!
<lb/>Be strong, renew the fight, and make the world
<lb/>too narrow for <persName>Kaus</persName>, spear and cut down
<lb/>his warriors, and behead his haughty chiefs.
<lb/>As for this lion-hearted man of <placeName>Sigz</placeName>,!
<lb/>Who maketh heaven redden with his sword,
<lb/>be bold and take him captive with your <sic>lassos</sic>.
<lb/>Whoever on the battlefield shall bring him
<lb/>down from the <sic>pard</sic>-skin to the dust shall have
<lb/>a realm, a parasol, my daughter’s hand,
<lb/>and be entitled <q>captain of the host ;</q>
<lb/>him will I make the lord of all <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and will exalt him to revolving heaven.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Thereat the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> rallied to the fight.
<lb/>With massive <sic>maces</sic> in their hands the brave,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.408"/>
<lb/>the chieftains of <placeName>Iran</placeName>, so slaughtered them
<lb/>that rivers, plains, and hills were strewn with slain—

<lb/>the more part of their host—and earth was puddled

<lb/>Afrisiyab fled <persName>Rustam</persName> with the troops

<lb/>from <placeName>Ghur</placeName>; he sought for gain but gained a loss,
<lb/>and seeing fortune’s bent left them and stricken

<head>How <persName>Kaus</persName> ordered the World</head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> arrived at <placeName>Pars</placeName>, the world began

<lb/>an age of happiness. He acted justly,

<lb/>adorned the throne, and gave free scope to feasting ;
<lb/>he sent forth wise and noble paladins

<lb/>with troops to all parts—<placeName>Marv</placeName> and <placeName>Nishapur</placeName>,

<lb/>Hardt and <placeName>Balkh</placeName>. Then justice ruled the world ;
<lb/>the wolf eyed rot the lamb. Such were his treasures,
<lb/>his state, and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, that fairies, men, and <sic>divs</sic>
<lb/>served him, all were his <sic>lieges</sic>, other kings

<lb/>were soldiers in his host. He gave the office

<lb/>of paladin of paladins to <persName>Rustam</persName>—

<lb/>the author of his weal—and wearied out

<lb/>the <sic>divs</sic> to build himself on Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName>

<lb/>two mansions, each ten <sic>lassos</sic> long, which they
<lb/>constructed at his bidding of hard stone.

<lb/>He excavated stables in the rocks,

<lb/>the columns were of stone with clamps of steel,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.409"/>
<lb/>and there he kept the war-steeds and the camels 
<lb/>to ride or carry litters. He erected

<lb/>a pleasure-house of crystal, studding it

<lb/>with emeralds ; a cupola of onyx

<lb/>brought from <placeName>Yaman</placeName>, and there installed <sic>archmages</sic>
<lb/>that learning might not fail; two armouries

<lb/>of virgin silver and a golden palace

<pb n="102"/>


<lb/>twice sixty <sic>cubits</sic> high for his own seat

<lb/>with turquoise <sic>traceries</sic>; he spared not jewels.
<lb/>It was a dwelling after his own heart,

<lb/>where daily <sic>provand</sic> waxed continually.
<lb/>There was no <sic>summertide</sic> or <sic>wintertide</sic>,

<lb/>the air was <sic>ambergris</sic>, the rain was wine,

<lb/>the days of <sic>springtide</sic> lasted all the year,

<lb/>and roses there were like a maiden’s blush,
<lb/>the heart was far from sorrow, pain, and travail,
<lb/>the <sic>divs</sic> were harmless being spent with toil.
<lb/>So good and just was he that fortune slept,

<lb/>One dawn <rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs>, unknown to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>addressed the assembled <sic>divs</sic>: <q> Our daily task
<lb/>is one of cruel labour for the Shah.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.410"/>

<lb/>We need a div shrewd and presentable
<lb/>to tempt him, soil his <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, wean him from God,
<lb/>and thus abate his tyranny.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>They heard
<lb/>and mused, None answered, for they feared <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<lb/>At length a wicked div arose and said :—
<lb/><q> Be mine this <sic>subtile</sic> task. I will pervert
<lb/>his mind from God as none but I can do.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Appearing as a youth of good address
<lb/>and mien, he waited till the famous Shah
<lb/>went hunting from <placeName>Pahlav</placeName>. The div approached
<lb/>with roses to present, then kissed the ground,
<lb/>and said: <q>Thy glory and thy <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> are such
<lb/>that heaven is thy fit home and earth thy slave;
<lb/>thou art the shepherd, nobles are the sheep.
<lb/>One thing is lacking still—that thou <sic>shouldst</sic> leave

<pb n="103"/>

<lb/>thine everlasting mark upon the world.
<lb/>How is it that the sun <sic>concealeth</sic> from thee
<lb/>the secret of its rising and its setting ?
<lb/>What is the moon? What are the night and day,
<lb/>and who is master of the turning sky ?
<lb/>Thou hast the earth and all thou didst desire ;
<lb/>now take the heaven also in thy toils.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah’s heart strayed, he <sic>tarried</sic> not to think,
<lb/>convinced that turning heaven favoured him.
<lb/>He knew not that the sky is <sic>ladderless</sic>,
<lb/>nor that, though stars be many, God but One,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.411"/>
<lb/>what ever He <sic>commandeth</sic> must be done ur
<lb/>how ever great the struggle and the stress.
<lb/>The Maker hath no need of sky and earth ;
<lb/>'Twas for thy sake that both of them had birth.

</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah mused how to roam the air though wingless,
<lb/>and often asked the wise : <q> How far is it
<lb/>from earth to moon?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The astrologers replied.
<lb/>He chose a futile and perverse device:
<lb/>he bade men scale the <sic>aeries</sic> while the eagles
<lb/>were sleeping, take a number of the young,
<lb/>and keep a bird or two in every home.
<lb/>He had those <sic>eaglets</sic> fed a year and more
<lb/>with fowl, <sic>kabab</sic>, and at some whiles with lamb.
<lb/>When they were strong as lions and could each
<lb/>bear off a mountain-sheep he made a throne
<lb/>of aloe from <placeName>Kumar</placeName><ref target="n.103.1"/> with seats of gold.
<lb/>He bound a lengthy spear at every corner,
<lb/>suspended a lamb’s leg from every spear-head,
<lb/>brought four strong eagles, tied them to the throne,
<lb/>and took his seat, a cup of wine before him.
<lb/>The swift-winged eagles, ravenous for food,
<lb/>strove lustily to reach the flesh, and raising

<note xml:id="n.103.1">Cape Comorin,</note>

<lb/>the throne above earth’s surface bore it <sic>cloudward</sic>.
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName>, as I have heard, essayed the sky

<lb/>to <sic>outsoar</sic> angels, but another tale

<lb/>is that he rose in this way to assail
<lb/>the heaven itself with his artillery.

<lb/>The legend hath its other versions too;
<lb/>none but the All-wise <sic>wotteth</sic> which is true.
</p><p>
<lb/>Long flew the eagles, but they stopped at last,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.412"/>

<lb/>like other slaves of greed. They sulked exhausted,
<lb/>they drooped their sweating wings and brought the Shah,
<lb/>his spears, and throne down from the clouds to earth,
<lb/>alighting in a forest near <placeName>Amul</placeName>.<ref target="n.104.1"/>
<lb/>the world preserved him by a miracle,
<lb/>but hid its secret purposes therein.
<lb/>In answer to his prayers a duck <ref target="n.104.2"/> appeared,
<lb/>for something must be had to eat and drink,
<lb/>and if Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> <persName>Kaus</persName> had perished there
<lb/>Worldlord Khusrau had not been born from him.<ref target="n.104.3"/>
<lb/>instead of sitting on his throne in might
<lb/>his business then was penitence and travail.
<lb/>He <sic>tarried</sic> in the wood in shame and grief

<lb/>I have been conversant with crown and throne,

<lb/>'Midst high and low so self-willed as <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<lb/>He hath no wisdom, common sense, or Faith,

<lb/>Thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say : <q>He hath no brains, his thoughts

<lb/>hath e’er essayed the heavens. Like witless madmen

</p><p>
<lb/>Whenas the paladins arrived they rated
<lb/>the Shah. <q>The madhouse is thy proper place,</q>
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> said, <q>not the city. Thou <sic>surrenderest</sic>
<lb/>thy seat to foes and <sic>tellest</sic> none thy whims.
<lb/>Thrice hast thou been in trouble, yet thy head
<lb/>is none the wiser! To <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>thou led’st a host, and look what mischief followed !
<lb/>Again, thou <sic>madest</sic> merry with a foe,
<lb/>yet thou—his idol—hadst to worship him !
<lb/>And when none in the world save holy God
<lb/>remained to read the title of thy sword,
<lb/>since earth was conquered, thou must needs try heaven,
<lb/>although to soar one hand-breadth is revolt.
<lb/>What bale hast thou encountered yet escaped !
<lb/>Hereafter folk will tell of thee: <q>A Shah
<lb/>went to the sky to see the sun and moon,

<lb/>serve God and Him alone in weal and woe.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName>, abashed before those famous heroes,
<lb/>replied: <q>No harm can come of righteous judgment ;
<lb/>thy words are righteous and thou hast convinced me.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He wept gall, called on God, and took his seat
<lb/>distressed and penitent within the litter.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.414"/>
<lb/>He reached his lofty throne, but, being troubled 
<lb/>still at his great offence, he quitted it

<pb n="106"/>

<lb/>and entered not his palace out of shame,
<lb/>but paced the dust in prayer before his God
<lb/>for forty days. Thou wouldst have said: <q>His skin

<lb/>for <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>. Abashed to meet the mighty men
<lb/>he ceased from <sic>banquetings</sic> and audiences,
<lb/>repented and did penance, giving <sic>largess</sic>,
<lb/>and laid his cheek upon the <sic>darksome</sic> dust
<lb/>in prayer to God who in a while forgave him.
<lb/>His scattered troops assembled at his gate ;
<lb/>god’s pardon gave him brightness; he was ware
<lb/>that penance had borne fruit. He took his seat
<lb/>crowned on the throne of gold, gave to his troops
<lb/>a <sic>donative</sic>, reformed the world, and grew

<lb/>the king of kings <sic>illumineth</sic> the throne.</q>
<lb/>From every province those illustrious chiefs,
<lb/>that had assumed the crown, renewed allegiance
<lb/>and journeyed to his court, old times returned,
<lb/>the monarch bathed his crown in love and faith,

<lb/>They spent a while at polo, wine, and hunting,

<lb/>There let us chase the rapid <sic>onager</sic>,

<lb/>a-hunting in yon desert of <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>to make ourselves a memory in the world.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> answered: <q> Be it as thou wilt,
<lb/>and prosper thou. Seek we <placeName>Turan</placeName> at dawn
<lb/>to hunt and harry in the deserts there.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>They all agreed and, when they rose next day,
<lb/>made ready eagerly, and setting forth
<lb/>with cheetahs, hawks, and baggage bravely sped
<lb/>toward the <placeName>Shahd</placeName> across the hunting-ground
<lb/>of great <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, on one side mountains,
<lb/>a river on another side, <placeName>Sarakhs</placeName>
<lb/>upon the third, a wilderness in front.
<lb/>Both deer and sheep flocked on the plain, which soon
<lb/>was occupied by tents and huts. The deer
<lb/>were <sic>frighted</sic> by the company, the lions
<lb/>no longer <sic>ravened</sic> there, birds as they flew
<lb/>knew something of the sport, for bird and beast
<lb/>lay everywhere in heaps, some killed, some wounded.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.418"/>

<lb/>The hunters were light-hearted, full of glee,
<lb/>with laughter constantly upon their lips,
<lb/>and having spent a <sic>sennight</sic> wine in hand
<lb/>were jovially bemused. The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>came as the eighth day dawned with needful warnings :—
<lb/><q> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> no doubt hath heard of us
<lb/>by this. We must not let that <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.419"/>

<lb/>devise a ruse, come forth to fight, and rob V

</p><p>
<lb/>The chief
<lb/>of all the offspring of <persName>Givgan</persName>—<persName>Gurdza</persName>—
<lb/>girt him for that <sic>emprise</sic>. With such a watchman
<lb/>the ruses of the foe were nothing worth.
<lb/>The others hunted in security.
<lb/>At length <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> gat news of them
<lb/>at sleeping-time and called his veteran chiefs,
<lb/>discoursed to them at large of <persName>Rustam</persName>, told them
<lb/>about the seven warriors—lion-like
<lb/>and gallant cavaliers—and thus he said :—
<lb/><q>We must not dally, but devise a ruse,
<lb/>and fall upon them unawares. If we
<lb/>can seize these seven warriors we shall <sic>straiten</sic>
<lb/>the world for <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>. We must go forth
<lb/>as if to hunt and take them by surprise.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He chose him thirty thousand famous swordsmen,

 

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.420"/>

<lb/>and spake thus: <q>Go not by the beaten track, 
<lb/>and slumber not but hasten night and day.</q>

<lb/>They hastened forth along the desert-route.

<lb/>And raised their necks for strife. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>dispatched meanwhile to cut those proud chiefs off
<lb/>a countless host. As they drew near the <sic>chace</sic>,
<lb/>advancing quickly eager for revenge,

<lb/>the outpost saw them like a <sic>darksome</sic> cloud,
<lb/>while dust arose like <sic>lapislazuli</sic>

<lb/>wherein a flag appeared. Like rushing wind
<lb/>he turned back shouting lustily and found

<lb/>the matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> and his mates at wine,

<lb/>with all his mighty army and his dash ;

<lb/>A battle-ground like this is all I need ;

<lb/>They poured the wine, and <persName>Rustam</persName>’s spirits rose ;

<lb/><q>I give the monarch of the age,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>And may he flourish ever soul and body,</q>

<lb/>With strung bow

<lb/>he ran toward the bridge but found the king

<lb/>Then matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> donned his tiger-skin,

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, like a lion that hath lost its prey,

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> departed like a rushing wind,

<lb/>That hero foamed and, as thou wouldst have said,

<lb/>a roar arose as of the rising sea.

<lb/>With shield o’er head and Indian sword in hand
<lb/>he slew most of those chiefs. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>saw this from far and said thus to his nobles :—
<lb/><q>If they fight thus till dark there will not be

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<head>How <persName>Pilsam</persName> fought with the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></head>
<p>

<lb/>There was a warrior, by name <persName>Pilsam</persName>,

<lb/>of royal race and eager for renown,

<lb/>his sire was glorious <persName>Wisa</persName> and his brother
<lb/>victorious <persName>Piran</persName>. Both in <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<pb n="113"/>

<lb/>and in <placeName>Turan</placeName> he had no peer save <persName>Rustam</persName>.

<lb/>On hearing what <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had said

<lb/>he frowned with rage and, <sic>hasting</sic> to the king,

<lb/>cried in his eager longing for the fray : —

<lb/><q>A youthful warrior of this host am I.

<lb/>What dust before me are the valiant <persName>Tus</persName>

<lb/>and gallant <persName>Giv</persName>—that Lion known to fame—

<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> and <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>,

<lb/>and brave <persName>Gurdya</persName>! At the king’s command

<lb/>I will go lion-like, smite off their heads,

<lb/>o’<sic>ercloud</sic> their moon, and bring their crowns to dust.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The king replied: <q>O famous warrior !

<lb/>May victory be thine. Thou must prevail

<lb/>and come back conquering and glorious.</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.427"/><p>
<lb/>Thereat <persName>Pilsam</persName> roared like a brazen trumpet, 

<lb/>charged the Iranian centre swift as dust,

<lb/>and struck to right and left with sword and ax,

<lb/>with lion-roars assailed <persName>Gurgin</persName> like wind,

<lb/>and smote upon the head his <sic>foeman</sic>’s charger,

<lb/>which came down headlong in its agony.

<lb/>This <persName>Gustaham</persName>, the well approved in war,

<lb/>beheld and, swiftly rushing from his post,

<lb/>made like a raging lion for <persName>Pilsam</persName>,

<lb/>and closing with that fiercely blazing Fire

<lb/>thrust at his <sic>foeman</sic>’s belt; the buckles held ;

<lb/>the spear was shivered in his grasp; he flung

<lb/>the <sic>haft</sic> away. <persName>Pilsam</persName> drew his keen sword,

<lb/>struck <persName>Gustaham</persName> with fury on the crest,

<lb/>and sent his helmet rolling, leaving him

<lb/>stunned and disarmed. When <persName>Zanga</persName> on the right

<lb/>saw that fierce struggle he advanced to help,

<lb/>and marked the evil plight of <persName>Gustaham</persName>.

<lb/><persName>Pilsam</persName> the Crocodile opposed the charge,

<lb/>and, coming with an Indian sword in hand,

<lb/>struck at and <sic>clave</sic> the mail of <persName>Zanga</persName>’s steed,

<lb/>which tumbled prone. The gallant warrior fell,





<pb n="114"/>

<lb/>took up, and knit his mail-skirt round his waist
<lb/>to strive afoot against the great <persName>Pilsam</persName>

<lb/>amid the dust—the prey against the lion.

<lb/>Dark clouds of dust rose from the scene of strife.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, looking from the centre of the host

<lb/>and seeing earth dark in the heroes' eyes,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.428"/>
<lb/>roared like the thunder on the mountain-top,

<lb/>or like the savage lion in the fight.

<lb/>He went to aid his comrades, and all four
<lb/>attacked <persName>Pilsam</persName>. That hero blenched no jot,

<lb/>but rushed upon them plying sword and mace:
<lb/>the four chiefs' hands were paralysed with wonder.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, beholding from the centre, saw

<lb/>his brother’s desperate case, rushed forth to help him,
<lb/>and shouted furiously to <persName>Giv</persName>: <q>O noble!

<lb/>It is no glory for you four to fight

<lb/>one lion-like and famous warrior.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He spake and charged amid a cloud of dust,
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> too rushed bravely to the <sic>mellay</sic>
<lb/>and smote with sword and axe and massive mace
<lb/>the captains of the army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.

<lb/>Then fled <persName>Pilsam</persName>, well knowing that that <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>
<lb/>would have his life. The Iranian chiefs and warriors
<lb/>slew with the massive mace so many <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>

<lb/>that corpses were piled up to reach the moon.
<lb/>Afrdstyab looked on and sighing cried :-—

<lb/><q>Where is <persName>Alkus</persName> the warrior who wished

<lb/>so oft to fight with Lions, in his cups

<lb/>would challenge <persName>Giv</persName> and plan a fight with <persName>Rustam</persName> ?
<lb/><placeName>Iran</placeName> was all that he would talk of then,

<lb/>where are his ardour and his bluster now?</q>

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.429"/><p>
<lb/><persName>Alkus</persName> was told, urged on his night-<sic>hued</sic> steed,
<lb/>and with his hands no doubt already bathed
<lb/>in blood came to the centre to the king,

<lb/>and cried aloud: <q>A man of war am I,
<lb/>a Lion waiting. At the king’s command

<pb n="115"/>

<lb/>I will go forth to battle single-handed.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch said: <q> Choose captains from the host.</q>
<lb/>More than a thousand valiant cavaliers
<lb/>went with him, carrying head-strewing lances,
<lb/>and glittering like <rs type="heavenlybody">Jupiter</rs> and <rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs>.
<lb/><persName>Alkus</persName> as he approached the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>obscured the sun and moon in clouds of dust,
<lb/>and when Zawira showed and challenged fight
<lb/>soon countered him and thought: <q>This should be <persName>Rustam</persName>,</q>
<lb/>Because he knew the seed of <persName>Nariman</persName>.
<lb/><persName>Zawara</persName> charged in lion-wise, but when
<lb/>his lance snapped, he was frayed and drew his sword.
<lb/>They veiled the world with dust. Both <sic>falchions</sic> shivered,

<lb/>they seized their <sic>maces</sic>. Quick as wind <persName>Alkus</persName>
<lb/>dealt such a blow as left <persName>Zawara</persName> senseless,
<lb/>who swooned and tumbled speechless <sic>froin</sic> his saddle.
<lb/>Alkts leaped down to take his <sic>foeman</sic>’s head,
<lb/>but <persName>Rustam</persName> seeing how his brother fared
<lb/>rushed like a fire toward him with a shout
<lb/>which shook <persName>Alkus</persName>' hand and dulled his sword.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.430"/>
<lb/>At hearing <persName>Rustam</persName>’s voice thou wouldst have said:— _
<lb/><q> His heart showed through his skin.</q> Swift as the wind
<lb/>he mounted, all forgetful of his manhood,
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q> Thou hadst not measured then
<lb/>the Lion’s claws and therefore wast so brave.</q>

<lb/>Then while <persName>Zawara</persName>, blood-stained, sorely wounded,
<lb/>and battered by the mace, regained his saddle,
<lb/><persName>Alkus</persName> encountered <persName>Rustam</persName> and thereby
<lb/>robed his bark-saddle with a winding-sheet,
<lb/>for thrusting with a spear at <persName>Rustam</persName>’s girdle
<lb/>he failed to pierce the mail, while <persName>Rustam</persName> thrust
<lb/>a spear at his foe’s head and dashed him down
<lb/>as '<sic>twere</sic> a mountain-crag to earth, his helmet
<lb/>Drownedin his heart’s blood, while both armies wondered,

<pb n="116"/>

<lb/>then fear came on the soldiers of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>while lion-like the seven warriors
<lb/>drew, and their gallant captains followed them
<lb/>with massive <sic>maces</sic> laid upon their shoulders.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> beheld them with amaze,
<lb/>turned, gazed upon his mighty men, and said :—
<lb/><q>The foe hath overcome you. Strive and battle
<lb/>like valiant <sic>pards</sic>.</q>

<lb/>The soldiers heard his voice,
<lb/>and fell on <persName>Rustam</persName> in a mass, while he
<lb/>charged them in fury with the seven warriors.
<lb/>They <sic>drave</sic> and routed all the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host,
<lb/>Incarnadined the land with brave men’s blood,
<lb/>and laid so many low that what with corpses
<lb/>and <sic>trunkless</sic> heads no vacant space was seen
<lb/>for troops to fight on, wheel, or pass between.

<lb/>Who thus exhorted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>: <q> My clever steed !

<lb/>escaped, but with wet cheeks and <sic>drouthy</sic> mouth,

<lb/>and other gear, great store fell to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>. 
<lb/>They gathered all and left the field, rejoicing,
<lb/>they did not strip the slain or seek the fallen,
<lb/>but went back to the hunting-ground and took

<p>The poet, after justifying in his prelude the ways of God to man in the matter of early death, tells how <persName>Rustam</persName>, in the course of one of his hunting expeditions to <placeName>Turan</placeName>, marries <persName>Tahmina</persName>, the daughter of the king of <placeName>Samangan</placeName>. <persName>Rustam</persName> returns to <placeName>Iran</placeName> and is subsequently informed by <persName>Tahmina</persName>, who has remained at <placeName>Samangan</placeName>, that she has borne him a son—<persName>Suhrab</persName>. In after years <persName>Suhrab</persName> joins the host of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> in an invasion of <placeName>Iran</placeName> in the hope of meeting his father, who has been misled by <persName>Tahmina</persName> into forming a false estimate of their son’s person and prowess. After a series of tragic misadventures father and son meet in single combat with fatal results.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p>The story of <persName>Suhrab</persName> is purely episodic, it might be omitted from the present reign without any apparent solution of continuity, and it is the only tale in the whole <persName>Shahnama</persName> that is at all familiar to the English reader. It has been translated into English at least twice, and has been retold according to Western ideas by Matthew Arnold, who has also followed the incorrect account of the episode given in Sir John Malcolm’s <q>History of <placeName>Persia</placeName>,</q> i. 27, note, where <persName>Tahmina</persName> is represented as having informed <persName>Rustam</persName> that she had given birth to a daughter. The improbability of the story may thus be lessened for the English reader, but to the Oriental eye it is the very improbability that makes it so impressive, as being an illustration of the working out of destiny which frustrates the best intentions, over-rides all obstacles, and makes mankind the puppets of its will, There is no trace of this story in Pahlavi literature as at present known to us.</p>

<p>§ 8. <placeName>White Castle</placeName>, known also as Mount <placeName>Sipand</placeName>,? probably is
identical with the <placeName>Spentodata</placeName> of the Zandavasta ? and the <placeName>Spendyad</placeName>

<lb/>told from the legends of a bygone age :—

<lb/>one morn in dudgeon <persName>Rustam</persName> rose to hunt,
<lb/>girt him, filled up his quiver, mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>and <sic>hied</sic> him to the marches of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,

<lb/>a savage Lion prowling after prey.

<lb/>When he drew near the marches and beheld
<lb/>the plain well stocked with <sic>onager</sic>, he flushed
<lb/>rose-like and smiled, then urging on his steed

<pb n="121"/>

<lb/>he dropped much game with arrow, mace, and lasso.
<lb/>He lit a fire with sticks, dry grass, and thorns,
<lb/>chose out a tree to serve him for a spit,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.435"/>
<lb/>and set thereon a lusty <sic>onager</sic>— 
<lb/>a feather’s weight to him! He tore the meat,
<lb/>when roasted, from the bones and sucked the marrow,
<lb/>drank of a neighbouring stream and wooed repose,
<lb/>while <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> careered and grazed along the mead.
</p><p>

<lb/>Some <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> horsemen chanced upon the plain
<lb/>and marked the tracks of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>. These they pursued
<lb/>beside the stream, observed him in the pasture,
<lb/>surrounded him, and with their royal <sic>lassos</sic>
<lb/>essayed to take him. <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> perceiving this
<lb/>raged like a mighty lion. Lashing out
<lb/>he laid two <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> low and with his teeth
<lb/>tore off another’s head. Thus three were slain,
<lb/>and still the head of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> escaped the noose ;
<lb/>at length the others threw from every side
<lb/>their <sic>lassos</sic>, caught him round the neck and took him,

<lb/>to have a share in him.

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> woke

<lb/>from pleasant sleep and needed docile <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>he looked about the mead but found him not,
<lb/>whereat in dudgeon and astound he hurried
<lb/>toward <placeName>Samangan</placeName>. <q>Now whither shall I trudge,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>to 'scape my dark soul’s shame, or how,

<lb/>the waste or make a shift to deal with foes ? 
<lb/>How will the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> say: <q>Who stole his <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> ?
<lb/>Thus matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> slept his life away !</q>

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> drew near <placeName>Samangan</placeName> the king

<lb/>The king’s chief nobles, who wore crowns themselves,
<lb/>went forth to welcome <persName>Rustam</persName>, and all said :—
<lb/><q>Can this be <persName>Rustam</persName> or the rising sun?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The monarch went to him afoot attended,

<lb/>and asked: <q>Who dared to meet thee in the fight ?
<lb/>We of this city are thy friends and servants,

<lb/>we and our goods are both at thy disposal,

<lb/>the heads and lives most dear to us are thine.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, seeing that the words were honest,
<lb/>replied: <q>In yonder meads my <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> while ranging
<lb/>without a rein or halter strayed from me,

<lb/>and I have traced him from the river-side

<lb/>my thanks are thine besides the recompense

<lb/>I will behead no few among thy chiefs.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The king made answer: <q>O exalted man!

<lb/>None will presume to thwart thee. Come and be

<lb/>my guest and be not <sic>wroth</sic> ; all will be well.

<lb/>Let us refresh our hearts with wine to-night

<head>How <persName>Tahmina</persName>, the Daughter of the King of Samangdn, came to <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>




<lb/>At noon of night, while <rs type="heavenlybody">Phosphor</rs> crossed the sky, 
<lb/>there came mysterious whispers, <persName>Rustam</persName>’s door
<lb/>was softly opened, and a slave who bare
<lb/>a taper savouring of <sic>ambergris</sic>
<lb/>walked stately toward the drunken sleeper’s couch.
<lb/>Behind the slave there was a moon-faced girl
<lb/>sun-bright, all scent and hue, with arching eyebrows
<lb/>and locks that hung in tresses lasso-like,
<lb/>in stature like a lofty cypress-tree,
<lb/>with cheeks <sic>carnelians</sic> of <placeName>Yaman</placeName> in colour
<lb/>and mouth as straitened as a lover’s heart.
<lb/>All soul was she and keen of intellect,
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>She is not of the earth.</q>
<lb/>The lion-hearted <persName>Rustam</persName> marvelled at her
<lb/>and calling on the Maker asked: <q>Thy name?
<lb/>What seek’st thou midst the murk of night? Thy will?</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>She said: <q> <persName>Tahmina</persName>: and thou well <sic>mayst</sic> say
<lb/>that mine affliction <sic>teareth</sic> me in twain.


<pb n="124"/>

<lb/>sole daughter of the king of <placeName>Samangan</placeName>,
<lb/>and by descent half lion and half <sic>pard</sic>,
<lb/>there is no mate for me among the kings,
<lb/>nor are there many like me under heaven.
<lb/>No one hath seen me yet outside the bower,
<lb/>no one hath ever heard me spoken of,
<lb/>but many and many a story have I heard
<lb/>of thee from every one—just like romance!

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.439"/>


<lb/>How div and lion, <sic>pard</sic> and crocodile,
<lb/>thou <sic>fearest</sic> not, thou art so deft of hand!
<lb/>How thou <sic>departest</sic> to <placeName>Turan</placeName> by night
<lb/>and <sic>roamest</sic> there <sic>unsleeping</sic> and alone,
<lb/>dost roast an <sic>onager</sic> to make a meal
<lb/>and set air wailing with thy scimitar!
<lb/>How at the sight of thee with mace in hand
<lb/>the hearts of lions and the hides of <sic>pards</sic>
<lb/>are rent! How eagles seeing thy naked sword
<lb/>dare not to swoop upon their quarry, and how
<lb/>great lions bear the traces of thy lasso,
<lb/>and clouds rain blood in terror of thy spear!
<lb/>Such are the tales of thee that I have heard !
<lb/>Oft have I bit my lips in wonderment
<lb/>and longed to see thy shoulders, neck, and breast.
<lb/>God hath ordained thy sojourn in this city,
<lb/>and now if thou wilt have me I am thine—
<lb/>I who was never seen by fowl or fish—
<lb/>because for one thing I adore thee so,
<lb/>have sacrificed my prudence to my passion,
<lb/>and for another—haply God Almighty
<lb/>may lay upon my breast a child of thine.
<lb/>Oh! may he be like thee in might and manhood,

<lb/>Moreover I will bring back <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> to thee
<lb/>and put all <placeName>Samangan</placeName> beneath thy feet.</q>

<lb/>The matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> heard her to the end.
<lb/>He saw what beauty and intelligence

<pb n="125"/>

<lb/>were hers, and that she brought him news of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>.
<lb/>Perceiving that the affair would turn out well
<lb/>he bade an <sic>archimage</sic>—a man of worship—

<lb/>The king, that noble Cypress, was well pleased

<lb/><persName>Tahmina</persName> on him with the usual rites. 
<lb/>The people all poured out their souls with joy
<lb/>and called down blessings on the paladin :—
<lb/><q> May this New Moon prove fortunate to thee,
<lb/>and be thy foes' heads plucked out by the roots.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>Night was not <sic>longsome</sic> while his mate was by, 
<lb/>but when the sun was bright he longed to throw
<lb/>the musky lasso off. He wore an <sic>armlet</sic>—
<lb/>a famous one. That gave he to <persName>Tahmina</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>Keep this. If thou shalt bear a daughter
<lb/>then plait it in her hair, and choose a time

<lb/>while if the stars vouchsafe to thee a son

<lb/>The sun will scorch not him.</q>

<lb/>He passed the night

<lb/>shone bright, and decked the earth with <sic>lovesomeness</sic>, 
<lb/>in taking leave he clasped her to his breast
<lb/>and showered kisses on her eyes and head,
<lb/>but fair <persName>Tahmina</persName> turned in tears from him

</p><p>


<lb/>The noble king of <placeName>Samangan</placeName> approached,

<head>The Birth of <persName>Suhrab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Nine months passed and a moon-like babe was born;

<lb/>Or else: <q>'Tis lion-<persName>Sam</persName>,</q> or <q> <persName>Nariman</persName>,</q>
<lb/>And since the babe smiled and was bright of <sic>blee</sic>
<lb/><persName>Tahmina</persName> gave to him the name <persName>Suhrab</persName>.
<lb/>He looked a year old in a month, his chest
<lb/>was like his sire’s, at three he exercised
<lb/>in arms, at five he had a lion-heart,
<lb/>at ten none dared encounter him in fight.
<lb/>He bluntly asked his mother once: <q> Now tell me,
<lb/>since none of my milk-fellows can compare
<lb/>with me, and my head <sic>reacheth</sic> to the sky,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.442"/>
<lb/>of what stock am I and of what descent ?
<lb/>What shall I say when asked about my father ?
<lb/>Thou shalt not live unless thou answer me.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>His mother said: <q>Then listen and rejoice,
<lb/>but be not rash. Thou art the son of <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>the hero of the elephantine form,
<lb/>the progeny of <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName>,
<lb/>and <placeName>Narwan</placeName>. Thy head out-<sic>toppeth</sic> heaven
<lb/>because thou <sic>comest</sic> of the famous stock,

<lb/>nor one like <persName>Sam</persName> the son of <placeName>Narwan</placeName>,
<lb/>whose head the heaven itself dared not to touch.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>She brought and showed a letter from his sire,
<lb/>three bright gems, and three purses filled with gold,

<pb n="127"/>

<lb/>sent to him by his father at his birth
<lb/>with these words: <q>Guard these well, because thy sire
<lb/>hath sent them unto thee, O noble child!</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>His mother said besides: <q> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>must not know aught hereof. He is the foe
<lb/>of <persName>Rustam</persName> and the <sic>troubler</sic> of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>May he ne’er seek revenge upon thyself
<lb/>and slay the son in dudgeon at the sire.
<lb/>Moreover, if thy father shall perceive

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> replied: <q>A thing like this will out.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<head>How <persName>Suhrab</persName> chose his Charger</head>
<p>

<lb/>He said moreover: <q>Thou shalt see my prowess,
<lb/>but I must have a charger swift of foot

<pb n="128"/>

<lb/>with hoofs of steel flint-shattering, in strength

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.444"/>

<lb/>like elephants, in flight like birds, in water
<lb/>like fish, and on the land like deer, to bear

<lb/>I must be mounted to encounter foes,</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>His mother’s head rose o’er the shining sun
<lb/>at hearing this. She bade the herdsman bring
<lb/>his herds of horses for <persName>Suhrab</persName> to choose
<lb/>a charger. So they gathered to the city
<lb/>the herds that wandered over hill and desert,
<lb/>and when some large-<sic>limbed</sic>, lusty steed appeared
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> flung round its neck the leathern noose,
<lb/>then laid his hand upon the beast to prove it
<lb/>and made it grovel. Thus his might broke down
<lb/>full many a noble steed ; he could not find
<lb/>one adequate, and grieved. At length a warrior
<lb/>approached the elephantine youth and said :—
<lb/><q>I have a colt—one of the breed of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>—
<lb/>in strength a lion and as fleet as wind.
<lb/>He is as '<sic>twere</sic> a valley-treading mountain
<lb/>and <sic>skimmeth</sic> like a bird along the waste.
<lb/>In strength and swiftness he is like the sun;
<lb/>none ever saw so fleet a roan. Beneath
<lb/>the stamping of his hoofs the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bull</rs>-fish <ref target="n.128.1"/> <sic>quaketh</sic> ;
<lb/>his leap is like the lightning ; on the mountains
<lb/>he <sic>goeth</sic> like the raven; on the water

<lb/>like shaft from bow, pursuing and o’<sic>ertaking</sic>
<lb/>the enemy.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> laughed out for joy,

<lb/>and when they brought to him that glossy charger

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.445"/>
<lb/>both proved it and approved it, coaxed, caressed,
<lb/>then saddled it, and mounted. He appeared
<lb/>like Mount <placeName>Bistun</placeName>; his spear was pillar-like,
<lb/>he said: <q>Since I have gotten such a steed

<note xml:id="n.128.1">See vol. i. p. 71.</note>

<pb n="129"/>

<lb/>I must ride forth at once and turn the day

</p><p>


<lb/>He made him ready
<lb/>to fight the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, and a host assembled.
<lb/>He then approached his grandsire, asking leave
<lb/>to go, and help in going: <q>I am fain

<lb/>Thereat the king provided him with arms

<lb/>those that were <sic>wielders</sic> of the massive mace—

<lb/>he chose two chiefs; <persName>Human</persName> was one, the other

<lb/><persName>Bahman</persName> ; no laggards they when Lions strove.

<lb/>He gave to them twelve thousand valiant troops,

<lb/>and said: <q>Be this your secret policy :

<lb/>the father must not recognise his son

<lb/>by any ties of instinct, love, or race ;

<lb/>so, when the twain encounter, in good sooth

<lb/>the matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> will be put to it.


<pb n="130"/>

<lb/>it may be that this lion-man will slay him.

<lb/>Then will we press <persName>Kaus</persName>, seize on <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName> gone, and settle with <persName>Suhrab</persName>

<lb/>some night by binding him in endless sleep ;

<lb/>while should he perish by his father’s hand

<lb/>that hero’s heart will never cease to burn.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>Those two shrewd paladins went to <persName>Suhrab</persName>,

<lb/>preceded by a present from the king—

<lb/>ten steeds caparisoned, ten mules of burden,

<lb/>a turquoise throne with ivory steps, a crown

<lb/>of amber tipped with pearls—and took a letter

<lb/>of adulation to the noble youth :-—

<lb/><q>If thou shalt seize the Iranian throne the age

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.447"/>
<lb/>will rest from strife. We are not far apart;

<lb/><placeName>Iran</placeName>, <placeName>Turan</placeName>, and <placeName>Samangan</placeName> are one.

<lb/>I send thee troops enough, sit on the throne

<lb/>and don the crown. Turdn hath no such leaders

<lb/>and brave hearts as <persName>Human</persName> and as <persName>Bahman</persName>,

<lb/>whom I dispatch to thee as guests, to be

<lb/>at thy command, to fight, if thou wouldst fight,

<lb/>and make the world strait to thine enemies.</q>
<lb/>Now when <persName>Suhrab</persName> was ware of their approach

<lb/>he girt his loins and with his grandsire went

<lb/>like wind to meet <persName>Human</persName>, rejoiced to see

<lb/>such troops. <persName>Human</persName> for his part was amazed

<lb/>to see the neck and shoulders of <persName>Suhrab</persName>,

<lb/>then gave to him the letter of the king,

<lb/>the gifts, the horses, and the mules of burden,

<lb/>and with <persName>Bahman</persName> delivered the king’s message.

<lb/>Now when the <sic>atheling</sic> had read the letter

<lb/>he beat the <sic>tymbals</sic> and led forth the host.

<lb/>Earth was all troops and clamour, neither lion

<lb/>and came down, like a lion, from the hold
<lb/>with girded waist upon a wind-foot steed.
<lb/>She sped like dust and cried in thunder-tones :—
<lb/><q>What are these troops and who <sic>commandeth</sic> them ?
<lb/>What lusty Crocodile is there among you
<lb/>to match himself with me in single combat ?</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>None volunteered until <persName>Suhrab</persName> beheld her.
<lb/>He bit his lips and laughed. <q> Again,</q> said he,
</p><p>

<lb/><q> An <sic>onager</sic> hath come within the toils
<lb/>of him that hath both strength and scimitar.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>He armed like wind, put on a helm of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<note xml:id="n.132.1">Khir, Cf. WPT, i. 104.</note>

<pb n="133"/>

<lb/>and rushed out to encounter <persName>Gurdafrid</persName>,
<lb/>who when she saw him strung her bow up, drew it,
<lb/>and broadened out her breast. No bird had found
<lb/>a passage through her shafts; she showered them
<lb/>upon <persName>Suhrab</persName> and wheeled to left and right.
<lb/>He saw and was abashed, waxed <sic>wroth</sic> and charged,
<lb/>his shield above his head. Thus pressed she hung

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.451"/>
<lb/>her bow upon her arm and, while her steed 
<lb/>pranced to the clouds, couched at <persName>Suhrab</persName> her lance,
<lb/>and plied her reins with fury. He too shook
<lb/>his reins and urged his charger on like lightning,
<lb/>fierce as a leopard, at his doughty foe.
<lb/>He thrust a deadly dart with all his strength,
<lb/>struck <persName>Gurdafrid</persName> upon the belt and rent
<lb/>her coat of mail, but even as she reeled
<lb/>she drew her sword and <sic>clave</sic> the dart asunder,
<lb/>regained her seat and sent the dust-clouds flying ;
<lb/>but liking not such fighting turned and fled.
<lb/>He urged his dragon-steed, and he too made
<lb/>in wrath day dark with dust. He pressed upon her
<lb/>with loud cries, jostled her, and snatched her helm.
<lb/>Her hair escaped, her face shone like the sun.
<lb/>He said: <q>It is a girl! Her head of hair
<lb/>is worthy of a crown. If such a girl,</q>
<lb/>He said amazed, <q>come from the Iranian host
<lb/>upon the field, good sooth their cavaliers
<lb/>will send dust <sic>cloudward</sic> on the day of battle!</q>
</p><p>


<lb/>He loosed his coiled up lasso from the straps
<lb/>and caught her round the waist, then said to her :—
<lb/><q>Why <sic>seekest</sic> thou the fray, O moon-faced maid ?

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.452"/>
<lb/>No <sic>onager</sic> like thee hath ever come 
<lb/>within my toils. Thou wilt not 'scape my clutch,
<lb/>so struggle not.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>She saw no other course,

<lb/>so showed her face and said: <q>O warrior,
<lb/>midst warriors a lion! two hosts watch


<pb n="134"/>

<lb/>our prowess with the mace and scimitar,
<lb/>and now that I have shown my face and hair
<lb/>the troops will say: <q>He sent the dust-clouds flying
<lb/>and all to fight a girl!</q> 'Twill be disgrace
<lb/>to persevere in such a fight as this.
<lb/>Chiefs should be wise, so let us keep it dark
<lb/>and save thee from reproach on mine account.
<lb/>Our troops and stronghold are at thy command,
<lb/>there is no need to fight, the castle, treasure,
<lb/>and castellan are thine when thou shalt please.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>She showed her face, her smiles displayed the pearls
<lb/>within her <sic>jujube</sic>-lips, a garden she
<lb/>in Paradise ; no villager e’er set
<lb/>so tall a cypress. She had eyes like deer’s,
<lb/>with arching eyebrows, and thou wouldst have said :—

</p><p>


<lb/><q>She <sic>bloometh</sic> ever.</q>
<lb/><q>Keep thy word,</q> said he,
<lb/><q>For thou hast seen me on the day of battle.
<lb/>Trust not yon castle-wall, it is not higher
<lb/>than heaven, and my mace will bring it down,
<lb/>while no foe’s lance will ever reach my neck.</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.453"/><p>

<lb/>She turned and rode with him toward the hold,
<lb/>and <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> himself came to the gate.
<lb/>They opened it and <persName>Gurdafrid</persName> came in
<lb/>both bruised and bound. They shut it and lamented
<lb/>for her and for <persName>Hajir</persName>. Then <persName>Gazhdaham</persName>
<lb/>approached with chiefs and troops, and said to her :-—
</p><p>


 <q> Brave-hearted lion-<sic>smiter</sic>! we were troubled
<lb/>on thine account. Thy fighting and address
<lb/>have not disgraced us, and no foe hath harmed
<lb/>thy life, thank God!</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>Then laughing much she went
<lb/>upon the ramparts to observe the foe,
<lb/>beheld <persName>Suhrab</persName> still mounted, and exclaimed :—

<pb n="135"/>

<lb/><q>O warrior of <placeName>Turan</placeName>! why take such pains ?
<lb/>Be off with you and give up battlefields.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> replied: <q>O fair of face! I swear
<lb/>by crown and throne and sun and moon to raze
<lb/>these ramparts to the ground and capture thee,
<lb/>thou minx! Thou wilt repent thy foolish words
<lb/>when thou art writhing in thy helplessness.
<lb/>Where is thy promise?</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>But she laughed and mocked him :—

<lb/><q>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> win no <sic>helpmates</sic> from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and thou hast failed with me, but never mind!
<lb/>Thou art no <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> who art so commended
<lb/>among the great, and with such strength and limbs
<lb/>art peerless midst the paladins! However,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.454"/>
<lb/>when news shall reach the Shah: <q>A chief is leading —-
<lb/>an army from <placeName>Turan</placeName>,</q> he will march forth
<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName> whom ye <sic>cannot</sic> stand against,
<lb/>and all thy host will perish. What mishap
<lb/>will then descend upon thy head I know not,
<lb/>but woe is me that such a neck and shoulder
<lb/>should disappear within the maw of <sic>pards</sic>!
<lb/>So do not trust too much those arms of thine
<lb/>or else the stupid ox will graze beside thee.
<lb/>'Twere best to issue orders for retreat.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName>, who thought the hold his own, was shamed.
<lb/>He gave to pillage all the land and crops
<lb/>around the walls, then for a moment washed
<lb/>the evil hand, and said: <q>Our time for action
<lb/>is not to-day; our hands are stayed from fight.
<lb/>At daybreak we will raise dust from these walls
<lb/>and carry war’s alarms inside the place.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>With that he turned about his charger’s rein
<lb/>and took the way to his own camp again.

<head>The Letter of <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> to <persName>Kaus</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Now when <persName>Suhrab</persName> had gone old <persName>Gazhdaham</persName>
<lb/>called for a scribe to write to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,

<lb/>then hurried off a speedy messenger

<lb/>and, having praised the Shah, reported thus :—
<lb/><q>A mighty host of valiant warriors

<lb/>Attacketh us, led by a paladin,

<lb/>whose years do not exceed twice seven at most,
<lb/>in stature taller than a lofty cypress,

<lb/>and in his aspect like the shining sun.

<lb/>His breast is lion-like, his mien is stately.

<lb/>I have not looked on such a hand and mace

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.455"/>

<lb/>within <placeName>Iran</placeName>. Whenas he <sic>brandisheth</sic>

<lb/>his Indian scimitar it <sic>shameth</sic> him

<lb/>to fight mere seas and mountains. Rattling thunder
<lb/>is no match for his voice, or for his arm

<lb/>our trenchant sword. No peer within <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>or in <placeName>Turan</placeName> hath he. This chief is named
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName>, and <sic>feareth</sic> not div, elephant,

<lb/>or lion; thou <sic>mayst</sic> say: <q>'Tis surely <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>at least some hero sprung from <placeName>Narwan</placeName>!</q>

<lb/>the brave <persName>Hajir</persName> rode out to challenge him,
<lb/>but, as I saw, no longer kept his seat

<lb/>than while a warrior might wink an eye,

<lb/>or scent go up a nostril to the brain.

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> unhorsed him to his great amazement.
<lb/>He is not hurt, and they have spared his life,
<lb/>but he is sorry and hath got his skinful

<lb/>of anguish. Many <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> cavaliers

<lb/>have I beheld, but never heard of one

<lb/>with such a seat. God grant he grapple not
<lb/>with one of us between the battle-lines ;

<lb/>I would have none, e’en though a Mount of flint,

<pb n="137"/>

<lb/>meet him upon the plain. The earth would pity
<lb/>that Mount if he should charge it in the fight,
<lb/>and if the Shah shall stop to breathe, march forth
<lb/>no host, and set no <sic>ambuscade</sic>, consider
<lb/>the <rs type="ethnic">Glory</rs> of <placeName>Iran</placeName> as gone, the world
<lb/>as panic-stricken by this warrior’s sword-point.
<lb/>Since he is Strength itself he will despoil us,
<lb/>and none can grapple with him hand to hand,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.456"/>
<lb/>or ever saw so skilled a rider. <q>He,</q> 
<lb/>thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say, <q>is <persName>Sam</persName> the cavalier.</q>
<lb/>we <sic>cannot</sic> fight this eager warrior
<lb/>with such a mace, grip, and dexterity.
<lb/>Know that the fortune of our warriors <sic>noddeth</sic>,
<lb/>and that his greatness <sic>reacheth</sic> to the sky.
<lb/>To-night we pack the baggage and withdraw,
<lb/>for if we tarry we shall make no fight,
<lb/>to say no more; these walls will not withstand
<lb/>one at whose rush a lion <sic>turneth</sic> laggard.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>The letter sealed he called a messenger,
<lb/>and said: <q>Be out of sight of them by dawn,</q>
<lb/>And having sent the letter on its way
<lb/>prepared to follow it without delay.

<lb/>Whenas the sun rose o’er the mountain-heights
<lb/>the soldiers of <placeName>Turan</placeName> girt up their loins,

<lb/>and spear in hand <persName>Suhrab</persName> the chief bestrode
<lb/>his swift-paced charger, <sic>purposing</sic> to capture

<lb/>but having, roaring like a lion, forced

<lb/>the gates, he saw no man of name within,

<lb/>for in the night the garrison had fled

<lb/>with <persName>Gazhdaham</persName>, because beneath the hold

<pb n="138"/>

<lb/>there was a way not <sic>wotted</sic> by the foe.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.457"/>

<lb/>Those still inside concerned with the defence
<lb/>or otherwise came to <persName>Suhrab</persName> as bidden,
<lb/>and sought by every means to save their lives.
<lb/>He looked for <persName>Gurdafrid</persName> but found her not.
<lb/>His heart was fain for love and union with her.
<lb/><q>Woe’s me!</q> he thought, <q>the bright Moon is <sic>beclouded</sic> !</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.458"/><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> received the letter and was grieved.
<lb/>He called the captains of the host to counsel—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.459"/>

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> and <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName>,

<lb/>He said in private: <q>This will cost us time,

<lb/>and <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> saith naught to comfort us.
<lb/>What shall we do, and what will cure this smart ?

<lb/>All agreed

<lb/>that <persName>Giv</persName> should go to <persName>Rustam</persName> at <placeName>Zabul</placeName>
<lb/>to say: <q>The throne of empire is in danger,</q>
<lb/>And summon him to take the field for war,

<lb/>a letter, and began by praising him :—

<lb/><q> Be thy heart prudent and thy spirit bright.
<lb/>Know that a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> chieftain with his host

<lb/>He is a brave, heroic paladin,

<pb n="139"/>

<lb/>in form an elephant, in heart a lion.
<lb/>None in <placeName>Iran</placeName> can fight him ; thou alone,
<lb/>that art so good at need, canst dim his lustre,
<lb/>thou heart and back-bone of the Iranian chiefs,
<lb/>who hast the claws and might of lions! Thou
<lb/>didst take the country of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>and in <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> undo our bonds.

<lb/>Sol <sic>weepeth</sic> at thy mace, and at thy sword

<lb/>thou art the shelter of <placeName>Iran</placeName>. The warriors

<lb/>The warriors in counsel read a letter

<lb/>should bear thee this account of good and ill.
<lb/>Now when thou <sic>readest</sic> this by day or night
<lb/>Ope not thy lips for words, and if thou have

<lb/>with wary horsemen and shalt raise the war-cry,
<lb/>to judge by that which <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> hath told
<lb/>none will confront this warrior.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>This sealed

<lb/>the Shah gave swift as wind to gallant <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>Be instant, ply thy fleet steed’s rein.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.462"/>
<lb/>Whenas thou <sic>reachest</sic> <persName>Rustam</persName> neither tarry, 
<lb/>nor sleep, within <placeName>Zabul</placeName>; if thou arrive
<lb/>by night return next day. Thus say to him :—
<lb/><q>A war is imminent, and in thine absence
<lb/>we <sic>cannot</sic> hold the foe of small account.</q></q>

</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> took it and sped night and day like wind,
<lb/>no rest, no sleep, no water, and no food,

<pb n="140"/>

<lb/>until <persName>Zal</persName> heard the cry: <q>A cavalier
<lb/>Approacheth from <placeName>Iran</placeName> as swift as dust.</q>

</p><p>



<lb/>The matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> met him with the troops
<lb/>and nobles wearing helmets. When they met,
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> and the warriors great and small dismounted,
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName> too who asked news of the Shah,
<lb/>and of <placeName>Iran</placeName>. They went thence to his palace
<lb/>to rest awhile. <persName>Giv</persName> told his errand, gave
<lb/>the letter, spake much of <persName>Suhrab</persName>, delivered
<lb/>his other tidings and the presents sent.

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> heard and read he laughed amazed,

<lb/>and said: <q>A horseman hath appeared like <persName>Sam</persName>!

<lb/>Now from our people this would not be strange,

<lb/>but from the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> 'tis incredible.

<lb/>None <sic>sayeth</sic>, and I know not, whence he is,

<lb/>the daughter of the king of <placeName>Samangan</placeName>

<lb/>bare me a son but he is still a child,

<lb/>the noble boy at present <sic>wotteth</sic> not

<lb/>of warfare, of attack, and self-defence.

<lb/>I sent his mother gold and precious stones

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.463"/>

<lb/>in plenty, and the messenger brought answer :—

<lb/><q>The darling is not growing very fast,

<lb/>but <sic>quaffeth</sic> wine with lips that savour milk.</q>

<lb/>no doubt he will be eager soon for war,

<lb/>and then his onslaught will be lion-like;

<lb/>he will lay low the head of many a horseman;

<lb/>but as for what thou <sic>sayest</sic>, O paladin!

<lb/><q>He came to fight us, vanquished brave <persName>Hajir</persName>,

<lb/>and bound him with the lasso head and foot!</q>

<lb/>the Lion’s whelp, though grown both brave and doughty,

<lb/>could not do that. Come, go we to <persName>Zal</persName>’s palace,

<lb/>rejoicing, then consider plans and who

<lb/>this lucky <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> paladin may be.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>They sought the ancestral hall and stayed awhile
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.464"/>
<lb/>in unconcern, then <persName>Giv</persName> again applied

<pb n="141"/>

<lb/>to <persName>Rustam</persName>, praising him and saying: <q> Hero,

<lb/>and chief of paladins! may crown and throne

<lb/>be bright to thee who art the crown’s adornment,

<lb/>thou favourite of fortune! Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>

<lb/>said thus: <q>Sleep not within <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>.

<lb/>If thou arrive by night return next day,

<lb/>for God forbid that war should press on us.</q>

<lb/>now, O exalted and most glorious chief!

<lb/>Let us depart in all haste to <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> answered : <q>There is naught to fear,

<lb/>for everything will end in dust at last,

<lb/>abide we here to-day in merriment

<lb/>naught <sic>recking</sic> of <persName>Kaus</persName> and of the chiefs.

<lb/>One day will we remain to breathe ourselves

<lb/>and put some liquor to our thirsty lips ;

<lb/>thereafter we will hasten to the Shah

<lb/>and show the heroes of <placeName>Iran</placeName> the way

<lb/>in case bright fortune be not yet awake.

<lb/>At all events the matter is a trifle,

<lb/>the rising sea will quench the fiercest flame.

<lb/>Een from afar my flag will fray his heart

<lb/>amid a feast. How can he be like <persName>Rustam</persName>—

<lb/>the master of the scimitar and mace—

<lb/>or <persName>Sam</persName> the hardy, brave, and circumspect ?

<lb/>He will not prove so eager for the fray.

<lb/>We need not take such matters seriously.</q> 

</p><p>


<lb/>They took the wine in hand and grew bemused

<lb/>with drinking to the monarch and to <persName>Zal</persName>,

<lb/>next morning <persName>Rustam</persName> though crop-sick made ready

<lb/>to start, but <sic>tarrying</sic> through drunkenness

<lb/>gave orders to the cooks to spread a feast.

<lb/>The banquet done they held a drinking-bout

<lb/>and called for wine and harp and <sic>minstrelsy</sic>.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.465"/>
<lb/>Next day he held another sunny-bright 

<lb/>and on the third day brought out wine at dawn,

<lb/>forgetful of <persName>Kaus</persName>. Upon the fourth

<pb n="142"/>

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, ready to depart, said thus to <persName>Rustam</persName> :-—
<lb/><q> <persName>Kaus</persName> is rash and hasty; to his mind
<lb/>this is no trifle. He was vexed and anxious,
<lb/>and would not eat or slumber or repose.
<lb/>By thus delaying in <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>
<lb/>we place him in a strait; he will be <sic>wroth</sic>
<lb/>and in his headstrong humour seek revenge.</q>
</p><p>


<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> answered: <q>Give it not a thought,
<lb/>for none will chafe at us.</q>
</p><p>


<lb/>He gave command

<lb/>to saddle <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and blow the brazen trumpets.
<lb/>The horsemen of <placeName>Zabul</placeName> came at the call
<lb/>in mail—a mighty army. He therein

<lb/>and looked to custom, law, and precedent.
<lb/>Do I deserve thy words? Art thou my patron ?
<lb/>Mine was the throne. I set <persName>Kubad</persName> thereon.

<pb n="144"/>

<lb/>what care I for <persName>Kaus</persName>, his wrath and bluster ?
<lb/>If I had not fetched <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> myself,

<lb/>when he had fallen into low estate,

<lb/>and brought him to <placeName>Iran</placeName> from Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName>,
<lb/>thou hadst not belt or vengeful scimitar,

<lb/>or might and majesty entitling thee

<lb/>to speak a word to <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName>.</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.468"/><p>
<lb/>He told the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> : <q> Valorous <persName>Suhrab</persName>

<lb/>will come and leave not either great or small;
<lb/>so make shift, all of you! to save your lives,
<lb/>and let discretion be your remedy.

<lb/>Ye will not see me more within <placeName>Iran</placeName> :
<lb/>the land is yours and mine the vulture’s wing.</q>

<lb/>He smote his steed and left them while his skin
<lb/>split, thou hadst said, with rage. The nobles' hearts
<lb/>were troubled ; they were sheep, he was their shepherd.
<lb/><q> Here,</q> said they to <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <q>is work for thee;
<lb/>thine is the hand to make the broken whole;

<lb/>thy words no doubt will influence the Shah.

<lb/>Go then to this <sic>insensate</sic>, speak to him,

<lb/>ply him with patient and persuasive speech :
<lb/>perchance thou <sic>mayst</sic> restore our fallen fortune.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Then all those warrior-nobles sat in conclave—
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Gudarz</persName> and lion-like <persName>Bahram</persName>,

<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> and brave <persName>Gurgin</persName>. They said: <q>The Shah
<lb/>Regardeth not the feelings of the great.

<lb/>Since <persName>Rustam</persName>, who is chief of paladins,

<lb/>first saved <persName>Kaus</persName> none else hath <sic>succoured</sic> him

<lb/>in all his straits and dangers. When the <sic>divs</sic>
<lb/>bound in <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> the Shah and us

<lb/>what toil and hardship <persName>Rustam</persName> underwent

<lb/>on his account, and rent the fierce <sic>divs</sic>' reins,
<lb/>then set the Shah upon the throne and summoned
<lb/>the mighty men to do him reverence!

<lb/>Another time too when our sovereign’s feet

<lb/>wore heavy fetters in <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>

<pb n="145"/>

<lb/>what monarchs <persName>Rustam</persName> slaughtered for his sake
<lb/>and never turned away but brought <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>home to his throne, and did obeisance to him !

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.469"/>
<lb/>If <persName>Rustam</persName>’s recompense must be to hang 
<lb/>then we must flee just when at such a crisis
<lb/>we should take action.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Thereupon <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>made haste to go before the Shah and said
<lb/>thus: <q>What hath <persName>Rustam</persName> done that thou <sic>shouldst</sic> send

<lb/>the dust up from <placeName>Iran</placeName> to-day? Art thou
<lb/>forgetful of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>, forgetful
<lb/>of what the <sic>divs</sic> did in <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>that thou <sic>sayst</sic>: <q>Put him living on the gibbet ?</q>
<lb/>vain words become not Shahs. When he hath gone,
<lb/>and that great host and wolf-like paladin
<lb/>have come, whom hast thou left to take the field
<lb/>and strew the dark dust o’er him? <persName>Gazhdaham</persName>
<lb/>by sight or hearsay <sic>knoweth</sic> all thy warriors,
<lb/>yet saith: <q>Ne’er let a cavalier propose
<lb/>to fight <persName>Suhrab</persName>. Small wisdom '<sic>twere</sic> for any,
<lb/>though brave as <persName>Rustam</persName>, to encounter him.</q>
<lb/>kings should be wise, for haste and wrath avail not.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The Shah, perceiving that <persName>Gudarz</persName> spake justly,
<lb/>repented of his folly and replied :—
<lb/><q>Thy <sic>rede</sic> is right; the old give best advice.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.470"/>

<lb/>Now go to <persName>Rustam</persName>, treat him courteously,
<lb/>induce him to forget my <sic>hastiness</sic>,
<lb/>assure him that my favour is restored,
<lb/>and bring him hither to <sic>illume</sic> my soul.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> went after <persName>Rustam</persName> with all speed,
<lb/>attended by the leaders of the host.
<lb/>They gathered round him and saluted saying :—
<lb/><q>Live happy evermore, be all the world
<lb/>beneath thy feet, and <sic>mayst</sic> thou sit for ever

<lb/>upon the throne. Thou <sic>knowest</sic> that <persName>Kaus</persName>




<pb n="146"/>

<lb/>is brainless and no picker of his words
<lb/>when angered, but <sic>regretteth</sic> them anon,
<lb/>and <sic>groweth</sic> reconciled through sheer good nature.
<lb/>If <persName>Rustam</persName> be aggrieved against the Shah
<lb/>the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> have done naught to drive him hence
<lb/>and hide his glorious face. The Shah moreover
<lb/>is sorry for those words of his and <sic>gnaweth</sic>
<lb/>his hand’s back in chagrin.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The hero said :—
<lb/><q>I need not anything of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>a saddle is my throne, a <sic>casque</sic> my crown,
<lb/>my mail my raiment and my purpose death.
<lb/>What is <persName>Kaus</persName> to me? A pinch of dust.
<lb/>Why should I fear or tremble at his wrath ?
<lb/>Do I deserve such unbecoming words
<lb/>from one that I released from bonds and led
<lb/>to crown and throne? Once in <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>
<lb/>I fought against the <sic>divs</sic>, and once I fought
<lb/>the monarch of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName> and freed
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> in his foe’s grip from bonds and woe.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.471"/>
<lb/>Now I have had enough; my heart is full;
<lb/>I fear but holy God.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>As soon as <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>had had his fill of speech <persName>Gudarz</persName> rejoined :—
<lb/><q>The Shah and famous warriors suspect
<lb/>that thou art frightened at this <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> chief.
<lb/>They say in private: <q><persName>Gazhdaham</persName> was right,
<lb/>our fields and fells will know us now no more,
<lb/>for <sic>sithens</sic> <persName>Rustam</persName> is afraid of fighting
<lb/>'Tis not for thee and me to tarry here.</q>
<lb/>I noticed that the Shah’s ill will and wrath
<lb/>made hue and cry at court, and all men spake
<lb/>about the brave <persName>Suhrab</persName>. Eclipse not thou
<lb/>thy high fame in the world by this withdrawal,
<lb/>and further, since a hostile host is near,
<lb/>dim not this crown and throne so wantonly,

<pb n="147"/>

<lb/>for we have been insulted by <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>and none whose Faith is pure <sic>approveth</sic> that.</q>
<lb/>The matchless hero all amazed replied :—

</p><p>

<lb/><q>I would not live a coward, I would tear
<lb/>my soul out first. I flee, as well thou <sic>knowest</sic>,
<lb/>because the monarch scorned me, not from fight.</q>
<lb/>He shrank from that reproach, retraced his steps,
<lb/>and came to Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>, who seeing him
<lb/>arose and thus excused what had occurred :—
<lb/><q>My temper is by nature choleric,
<lb/>and trees must grow as God hath planted them.
<lb/>Through this new, unexpected foe my heart
<lb/>was faint as a new moon. I sought a cure

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.472"/>

<lb/>and sent for thee. Thy <sic>tarrying</sic> made me <sic>wroth</sic>,
<lb/>but having wronged thee, elephantine chief!
<lb/>I <sic>sorrowed</sic> and my mouth was filled with dust.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> answered him: <q>The world is thine.
<lb/>We are thy subjects, thine is to command.
<lb/>I am a liege, if worthy of the name,
<lb/>before thy gate to do thy will. Thou art
<lb/>the Shah, the lord of earth; I am thy slave.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> replied: <q>O paladin! be bright
<lb/>of mind for evermore. To-day we hold
<lb/>a banquet and to-morrow think of battle.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He had a royal pleasure-house made ready ;
<lb/>its hall was like a garden in the spring.
<lb/>They called the chiefs and scattered gems for joy.
<lb/>Half through the night they revelled and their talk
<lb/>was of the doings of the mighty men.
<lb/>They drank till hearts and eyes were dazed with wine,
<lb/>and all became bemused, returning home
<lb/>while tedious night was traversing the dome.

<lb/>When Sol had pierced night’s pitch-<sic>hued</sic> cloak and come

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.473"/>

<lb/>forth from the veil <persName>Kaus</persName> bade <persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>to bind the drums upon the elephants.
<lb/>He <sic>oped</sic> the treasury-door, gave out supplies,
<lb/>then called to horse and loaded up the baggage.
<lb/>A hundred thousand cavaliers in mail
<lb/>went into camp, and as the army marched
<lb/>heaven darkened with the chargers' dust. The tents
<lb/>and tent-enclosures stretched two miles, and earth
<lb/>was clad with elephants and horses' shoes ;
<lb/>the sky grew dark as indigo, earth turned
<lb/>to ebony, the drum-roll shook the plain,
<lb/>the army marched, the sun’s bright visage <sic>gloomed</sic>,
<lb/>and double-pointed javelin and dart
<lb/>flashed like a flame through dust as through a veil.
<lb/>What with the spears and flags of divers fashion,
<lb/>the golden <sic>bucklers</sic> and the golden boots,
<lb/>thou wouldst have said : <q>There came an <sic>ebon</sic> cloud
<lb/>which showered <sic>sandarac</sic>.</q> The world discerned not
<lb/>between the night and day, and thou hadst said
<lb/>that neither sky nor Pleiades existed.
<lb/>Thus marched the army, hiding soil and rock,
<lb/>until it neared the portal of the stronghold.



</p><p>

<lb/>An <sic>outery</sic> from the lookout warned <persName>Suhrab</persName> :-—
<lb/><q>A host hath come.</q> He mounted to the walls
<lb/>to view it and then showed it to <persName>Human</persName>,
<lb/>who, when he saw so great a multitude
<lb/>approaching, was afraid and held his breath.
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> the hero said: <q> Relieve thy heart
<lb/>of care, thou wilt not see in this vast host
<lb/>a single warrior or massive mace

<pb n="149"/>

<lb/>meet me upon the field though sun and moon
<lb/>be on their side. The men and arms abound,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.474"/>
<lb/>Now by the fortune of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> 
<lb/>will I make all the desert like a sea.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Descending, light of heart and unconcerned,
<lb/>he joined the revels of the revellers,
<lb/>and <sic>recked</sic> not of the war.

<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>

<lb/>set up the camp-enclosure of the Shah
<lb/>before the castle on the open plain ;
<lb/>men, <sic>tentage</sic>, and enclosures covered hill
<lb/>and wilderness till naught was left to fill.

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> slew <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>At sunset, when night’s skirt trailed o’er the day,
<lb/>came <persName>Rustam</persName> girded and intent on war
<lb/>before the Shah, and said: <q>Let me go forth
<lb/>without my belt and helmet. I will mark
<lb/>who this new <sic>worldlord</sic> is, who are the chiefs,
<lb/>and who is in command.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>The very work for thee, and <sic>mayst</sic> thou prosper
<lb/>both soul and body. God watch o’er thee ever,
<lb/>and o’er thy heart’s desire and loyal purpose.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Assuming <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> garb he reached by stealth
<lb/>the hold and heard the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' shouts and clamour.
<lb/>The gallant hero made his way inside,
<lb/>as '<sic>twere</sic> a lion after antelopes,
<lb/>and saw and marked the chieftains one and all,
<lb/>joy mantling in his visage like a rose.



</p><p>

<lb/>Now when <persName>Suhrab</persName> was going to the wars

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.475"/>
<lb/>his mother summoned to her <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName>, 

<pb n="150"/>


<lb/>for once he had seen <persName>Rustam</persName> at a feast.
<lb/>His father was the king of <placeName>Samangan</placeName>,
<lb/>his nephew glorious <persName>Suhrab</persName>. She said :—
<lb/><q>O ardent warrior! be this youth’s comrade
<lb/>that when the hero cometh to <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>and <sic>meeteth</sic> with the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>and when the hosts encounter in the fight,
<lb/>thou <sic>mayest</sic> show my darling son his father.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Now as <persName>Suhrab</persName> appeared to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s eyes
<lb/>enthroned amid the feast with <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName>
<lb/>on one hand, with the valiant cavalier
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> and that illustrious Lion <persName>Bahman</persName>
<lb/>upon the other, thou hadst said that he
<lb/>filled all the throne and seemed a verdant cypress.
<lb/>His arms were like a camel's thighs, his breast
<lb/>was like a lion’s and his visage ruddy.
<lb/>A hundred valiant warriors sat round,
<lb/>all young, illustrious, and lion-like,
<lb/>while fifty slaves with bracelets on their arms
<lb/>before the heart-delighting lofty throne
<lb/>invoked by turns a blessing on his mien,
<lb/>his stature, sword, and signet-ring. As <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>crouched at a distance watching, <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName>
<lb/>went out for some occasion that he had,
<lb/>perceived a warrior like a lofty cypress,
<lb/>to whom there was no peer among the troops,
<lb/>and seizing on him roughly questioned him
<lb/>with sharpness, saying: <q> Who art thou? Speak out!
<lb/>Come to the light and let me see thy face.</q>




</p><p>

<lb/>A sudden buffet from the fist of <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>fell on his neck ; he yielded up the ghost.
<lb/>There <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName> lay—a corpse; for him
<lb/>the day of fighting and of feast was over.




</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> continued long in expectation,
<lb/>but <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName> the Lion came not back.
<lb/>At length the youth began to ask for him

<pb n="151"/>

<lb/>because his room was empty. Some went out,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.476"/>
<lb/>beheld him vilely overthrown, at peace 
<lb/>from banquet and from battle, and returned

<lb/>with clamour, and with sorrow in their hearts.
<lb/>They told <persName>Suhrab</persName> that <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName> was dead.
<lb/>The youth sprang up and went to him like smoke,
<lb/>accompanied by servants, lights, and minstrels,
<lb/>beheld him lying dead and stood astound,

<lb/>then called his gallant warriors and said :—

<lb/><q>Ye men of wisdom and ye valiant chiefs !




<lb/>Ye must not rest to-night but whet your spears,
<lb/>because a wolf hath come among the flock

<lb/>and found the dogs and shepherds off their guard.
<lb/>Among the mighty he hath seized one ram

<lb/>and cast him thus in scorn, but with God’s help,
<lb/>when my bay <sic>trampleth</sic> earth, I will <sic>unstrap</sic>

<lb/>my lasso in revenge for <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName>.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>He took his seat again and called the nobles.
<lb/><q>Though <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName>’s place beside my throne
<lb/>is void,</q> he said, <q>I have not done with feasting.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>As <persName>Rustam</persName> was returning to the Shah,

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, who was outpost-guard, saw him approach,
<lb/>drew, roared out like a maddened elephant,
<lb/>and with his shield above his head showed fight ;
<lb/>but <persName>Rustam</persName> knowing who the outpost was
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.477"/>
<lb/>laughed and returned the shout, whereat the guard, 
<lb/>who knew his voice, advanced afoot and said :—
<lb/><q>Where hast thou been afoot and in the dark,
<lb/>thou battle-loving chieftain ?</q>



</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> told
<lb/>his enterprise and what a lion-man
<lb/>he had destroyed, while <persName>Giv</persName> applauded, saying :—
<lb/><q> May charger, mace, and saddle ne’er lack thee.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> going to the Shah informed him
<lb/>about the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> and their banqueting,

<lb/>about <persName>Suhrab</persName>, his stature and his mien,

<pb n="152"/>

<lb/>his arms and shoulders, chest and feet, and said :-—
<lb/><q>This is no <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> born ; he is as tall
<lb/>and upright as a cypress, with no peer
<lb/>in either land; in short 'tis <persName>Sam</persName> himself,</q>
<lb/>Then of the blow on <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName>’s neck
<lb/>he said: <q>He came not back to feast or fight.</q>
<lb/>They talked and after called for harp and wine,
<lb/>but all the night the troops were ranked in line.

<lb/><q>On the right,</q>

<lb/>with elephants and baggage. The enclosure

<lb/>Who is he? Let me know the chieftain’s name,
<lb/>and bring not ruin on thyself by guile.</q>

</p>

<pb n="154"/>



<p>

<lb/>He answered : <q>That <sic>belongeth</sic> to <persName>Gudarz</persName>—
<lb/>the glory of the Free—son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>,
<lb/>a valiant general in war. He hath
<lb/>twice forty sons, all Elephants and Lions.
<lb/>No elephant, no tiger of the plain,

<lb/>a paladin is seated, one that hath

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.480"/>

<lb/>Before him is a charger just his match

<lb/>Whene’er the charger <sic>snorteth</sic> thou wouldst say :—
<lb/><q>It is the raging sea!</q> In front of him
<lb/>are many elephants in mail, and he
<lb/>is restless. I behold not in <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>one of his height or such another charger.
<lb/>There is a dragon, look! upon his standard,
<lb/>and on the staff-top is a golden lion.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName> thought: <q>If I tell this lion-man
<lb/>the bearings of the elephantine hero,

<lb/>he would not credit his own eyes. Again

<lb/>Above it is a flag charged with a wolf;
<lb/>the golden staff-head <sic>reacheth</sic> to the clouds;

<lb/>He answered : <q> That is <persName>Giv</persName> son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>he whom the chieftains call <q>the gallant <persName>Giv</persName>,</q>
<lb/>the best and greatest of the family,
<lb/>and captain o’er the more part of the host.
<lb/>He is the noble son-in-law of <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>and equalled but by few within <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> continued: <q> Where the shining sun
<lb/>is rising I perceive a white enclosure
<lb/>all of brocade of <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs> make. Before it
<lb/>more than a thousand cavaliers are ranged ;
<lb/>the footmen armed with double-headed spears
<lb/>and <sic>bucklers</sic> there make up a boundless host.
<lb/>Their leader <sic>sitteth</sic> on an ivory throne
<lb/>upon a seat of teak. The tent-enclosure
<lb/>is of brocade, and many slaves stand ranked.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName> replied: <q>'Tis youthful <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>son of the Shah and crown of warriors.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Subrab said: <q>It is fitting, since he is
<lb/>the Shah’s son and possessor of a crown.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>He asked : <q> Whose is that yellow tent-enclosure
<lb/>in front whereof a banner <sic>fluttereth</sic>
<lb/>with others yellow, red, and violet round it?
<lb/>The charge upon the <sic>hindmost</sic> is a boar,
<lb/>and on the lofty staff a <sic>silvern</sic> moon.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/><q> His name,</q> <persName>Hajir</persName> made answer, <q>is <persName>Gurdya</persName>, 
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.482"/>

<lb/>who <sic>draweth</sic> not the rein in fights with lions—
<lb/>a prudent man descended from <persName>Givgan</persName>,

<pb n="156"/>

<lb/>who never <sic>murmureth</sic> at pain or hardship.</q>
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> thus sought for traces of his father:
<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName> was reticent and hid the truth.
<lb/>The Almighty hath disposed the world. Wilt thou
<lb/>dispose it? Hath He ceased to superintend ?
<lb/>A fate not of thy choice is written now,
<lb/>and what He <sic>causeth</sic> will be in the end.
<lb/>If thou <sic>affectionest</sic> this Wayside Inn


</p><p>

<lb/>Twill yield thee poison, travail, and chagrin.

<lb/>The noble hero asked <persName>Hajir</persName> again

<lb/>about that one whom he so longed to see,
<lb/>about that green enclosure and tall steed,
<lb/>about that warrior and the twisted lasso.

<lb/>At last <persName>Hajir</persName> said: <q>I must keep back naught.
<lb/>If I tell not the name of him of <placeName>Chin</placeName>

<lb/>it is because I know it not myself.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Subrab replied: <q> Thou <sic>doest</sic> much amiss,
<lb/>thou hast not mentioned <persName>Rustam</persName>, and that chief
<lb/>of paladins would show amid the host.

<lb/>Thou <sic>saidst</sic> : <q>He is the champion, he that <sic>guardeth</sic>
<lb/>all provinces and marches.</q> When <persName>Kaus</persName>

<lb/>is warring, with a mighty elephant

<lb/>to bear his crown and throne, the paladin

<lb/>should lead his van what time the war-cry <sic>riseth</sic>.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName> replied: <q>The lion-taking hero
<lb/>must be at present in <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>,

<lb/>for 'tis the time to feast among the roses.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> rejoined: <q> Now answer this—the Shah
<lb/>is bent on war and, while <sic>helmed</sic> chieftains gather
<lb/>to give him aid, the paladin in chief
<lb/>is merry-making! Young and old would laugh
<lb/>at such a tale. We made a pact to-day,

<lb/>and though I love not words I will repeat it :—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.483"/>

<lb/>if thou wilt point me out the paladin

<lb/>thy head shall be exalted everywhere ;

<lb/>I will unlock the secret treasuries

<pb n="157"/>

<lb/>and leave thee not a want, but if thou <sic>keepest</sic>
<lb/>this secret from me, making mystery
<lb/>where there is none, I will cut off thy head.
<lb/>Consider now which course thou wilt adopt.
<lb/>Know’st not the saying of the <sic>archimage</sic>
<lb/>when speaking of some matter to the king ?
<lb/><q>A word <corr>unspoken</corr> is a jewel still



<lb/>uncut, still kept in bonds; but, once set free
<lb/>from bondage and disablement, may fill



<lb/>the <sic>bezel</sic>—priceless, glittering brilliantly.</q></q>
<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName> responded: <q> When my lord the prince
<lb/>is weary of his signet, crown, and state,
<lb/>then let him seek a warrior in the world
<lb/>who <sic>overthroweth</sic> mighty elephants,
<lb/>and with his anvil-breaking mace-head <sic>robbeth</sic>
<lb/>two hundred of existence at a blow;
<lb/>for <persName>Rustam</persName> when opposed to any one
<lb/>will bring his head down from the sky to dust.
<lb/>No elephant on earth is match for him,
<lb/>his steed’s dust is more black than indigo,
<lb/>his body hath a hundred strong men’s strength,
<lb/>his head is taller than a lofty tree,
<lb/>and when he <sic>rageth</sic> on the day of battle
<lb/>what is a lion, elephant, or man
<lb/>within his grasp ?</q>


</p>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.484"/>

<p>

<lb/>High-born <persName>Suhrab</persName> replied :—

<lb/><q><persName>Gudarz</persName> son of Kishwdd hath evil luck
<lb/>in that for all his puissance, wit, and prowess
<lb/>he hath to call thee son. Where hast thou looked
<lb/>on men of war or heard their chargers' tramp
<lb/>that thou <sic>describest</sic> <persName>Rustam</persName> in such terms
<lb/>and <sic>utterest</sic> his praise continually ?
<lb/>Thou <sic>fearest</sic> fire because the stream is calm,
<lb/>but when it is in flood the fuming fire
<lb/>will soon be quenched, and when the sun shall draw
<lb/>its blazing sword night’s head will go to sleep.</q>
</p>



<pb n="158"/>


<p>

<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName> unwitting thought: <q>If I declare
<lb/>the lion-taker’s bearings and inform
<lb/>this <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> with such hand and neck and seat,
<lb/>he will arouse his warriors to fight
<lb/>and urge along his elephantine steed.
<lb/>He hath such strength and such a neck and shoulder
<lb/>that <persName>Rustam</persName> will be slaughtered in his grasp.
<lb/>Not one of all our warriors will come
<lb/>to meet him face to face, and he will seize
<lb/>the throne of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>. An <sic>archmage</sic>'said :—
<lb/><q>It is a better thing with fame to go
<lb/>from life than live and gratify the foe,</q>
<lb/>if it be mine to perish by his hand
<lb/>day will not darken nor stream turn to blood.
<lb/>Three score and sixteen sons—all lion-men—
<lb/>hath old <persName>Gudarz</persName> beside myself, as <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>who <sic>conquereth</sic> worlds and <sic>breaketh</sic> hosts, and is
<lb/>in every place the leader of the folk,
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName>, <persName>Ruhham</persName> the exalted, and <persName>Shidush</persName>
<lb/>the lion-slaying warrior, and they all
<lb/>will show me kindness after I am dead,
<lb/>and in revenge will slay our enemies ;

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.485"/>

<lb/>but when <persName>Gudarz</persName> and all his seventy sons
<lb/>beloved—illustrious men and warriors—
<lb/>cease from <placeName>Iran</placeName> let me too be no more.
<lb/>I mind a holy <sic>archimage</sic>’s words :—
<lb/><q>When cypress-roots appear the pheasant well
<lb/>may hesitate at common grass to smell.</q></q>

<lb/>Then said he to <persName>Suhrab</persName> : <q> Why so much heat ?
<lb/>Thy questioning to me is all of <persName>Rustam</persName>.
<lb/>Why must thou pick a quarrel with me thus
<lb/>by asking foolish questions? Just because
<lb/>I <sic>cannot</sic> give thee an account of him
<lb/>wilt thou behead me? Thou need’st no excuse
<lb/>for shedding blood; show thy true colours then.
<lb/>Thou wilt not crush the elephantine chief,

 

<pb n="159"/>

<lb/>or get him easily within thy clutches,
<lb/>refrain from seeking him in fight, for he
<lb/>will surely make the dust fly out of thee.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
<head>How <persName>Suhrab</persName> attacked the Army of <persName>Kaus</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> the chief of warriors, when he heard

<lb/>these harsh words, turned his back upon <persName>Hajir</persName>,

<lb/>and hid his face without reply, astounded

<lb/>at that dark utterance; then from <sic>saddleback</sic>

<lb/>he fiercely struck <persName>Hajir</persName> a blow back-handed,

<lb/>felled him, and went his way, mused much and long,

<lb/>and made his preparations for the fight.

<lb/>He girt him with the girdle of revenge,

<lb/>took from his princely head the golden crown,

<lb/>put on his mail and breastplate joyfully,

<lb/>and set a <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs> helmet on his head.

<lb/>That paladin, that binder of the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>,

<lb/>took spear, bow, lasso, and his massive mace,

<lb/>the blood was boiling in his veins with ardour.

<lb/>He mounted on his rapid steed, sent up


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.486"/>
<lb/>the battle-cry, and spear in hand rushed out 

<lb/>like some mad elephant upon the field.

<lb/>He came forth bent on fight, he made the <sic>dustclouds</sic>

<lb/>fly to the moon, then charged the Shah’s enclosure

<lb/>and made it totter with his spear, while all

<lb/>the valiant chieftains fled like <sic>onagers</sic>

<lb/>before a lion’s claws; not one had courage

<lb/>to face such foot and stirrup, hand and rein,

<lb/>such arm and flashing spear. They met and said:

<lb/><q> Here is an elephantine hero for you—

<lb/>one that we <sic>cannot</sic> look on <sic>unappalled</sic> !

<lb/>Who is there bold enough to challenge him ?</q>

<pb n="160"/>

</p><p>
<lb/>Anon <persName>Suhrab</persName> the warrior raised his voice,

<lb/>Assailing Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> with scornful words,

<lb/>and thus he said: <q>O monarch of the Free!
<lb/>What business hast thou on the battlefield ?
<lb/>Why dost thou bear the name of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>

<lb/>who canst not stand where Lions fight together ?
<lb/>I wield my spear and all thy troops are cowed.
<lb/>Upon the night that <persName>Zhanda Razm</persName> was slain

<lb/>I swore a mighty oath while at the feast :—

<lb/><q>I will not leave a spearman of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>and I will hang <persName>Kaus</persName> upon the gibbet

<lb/>alive.</q> What mighty man hast thou to meet me?</q>

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.487"/><p>

<lb/>He spake and waited long in silence. None
<lb/>made answer from <placeName>Iran</placeName>. Then bending down
<lb/>he forced out seventy tent-pegs with his spear,
<lb/>the tent-enclosure tumbled to the ground,

<lb/>and everywhere the blast of <sic>clarions</sic> sounded.
<lb/>Shah <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> exclaimed in his dismay :—

<lb/><q>O men of noble name and glorious race !

<lb/>Let some one take the news to <persName>Rustam</persName>, saying :—
<lb/><q>Our warriors' wits are ousted by this <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>.

<lb/>I have no cavalier to fight with him ;

<lb/>none of <placeName>Iran</placeName> is bold enough to go.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> bore the message and told <persName>Rustam</persName> all,
<lb/>who thus made answer: <q> Every other Shah,
<lb/>that called me suddenly, called me at times
<lb/>to feast, at times to fight, but with <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>I ne’er see aught excepting fight and travail!</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then gazing from his tent he found that <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>who had but just arrived, was saddling <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>and that <persName>Gurgin</persName> was crying: <q>Quick! Make haste:</q>
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> was fastening the girth and mace,

<lb/>and <persName>Tus</persName> had got in hand the horse’s mail.

<lb/>Each one was crying to another : <q>Quick !</q>

<lb/>The matchless hero heard it from his tent

<lb/>and thought: <q> This must be <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>’s own fight !

<pb n="161"/>

<lb/>so great a hubbub is not made for one.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He put on his cuirass of tiger-skin,
<lb/>then girt a royal girdle round his loins,
<lb/>and mounting <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> set forth. He left <persName>Zawara</persName>
<lb/>in charge of throne and troops, enjoining him :—
<lb/><q> Advance not and take no commands save mine.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>They bore his standard with him as he went
<lb/>intent on fight and angry. When he saw
<lb/>the limbs and shoulders of <persName>Suhrab</persName>, his breast
<lb/>as broad as that of valiant <persName>Sam</persName>, he said :—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.488"/>

<lb/><q>Go we aside to some fit spot for battle.</q> 



</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> began to rub his hands, he turned
<lb/>back from the Iranian lines, and said to <persName>Rustam</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Come then; we mighty men require no help;
<lb/>the fight between us will suffice, and yet
<lb/>the field of battle is no place for thee ;
<lb/>thou canst not bear one buffet from my fist.
<lb/>Great stature hast thou, mighty limbs and neck,
<lb/>but they are weak with age.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, gazing
<lb/>upon that haughty one with such long stirrups,
<lb/>and such a hand and shoulder, answered mildly :-—
<lb/><q>Fair youth! the earth is hard and cold, the air
<lb/>is soft and warm. Old am I, but have seen
<lb/>full many a stricken field, and many a div
<lb/>hath perished by my hand, yet saw I never
<lb/>myself o’<sic>ercome</sic>. Wait till we fight together ;
<lb/>if thou <sic>survivest</sic> fear no crocodile.
<lb/>Both seas and mountains have beheld how I
<lb/>have striven with the famed chiefs of <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>in fight: the stars bear witness to my deeds.
<lb/>My might hath laid the world beneath my feet,
<lb/>and now my heart doth yearn in ruth for thee;
<lb/>I would not take thy life. Thou wilt not leave
<lb/>behind a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> with such neck and shoulders.

<lb/>I know no peer to thee e’en in <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q>


<pb n="162"/>

<lb/>when <persName>Rustam</persName> spake <persName>Suhrab</persName>’s heart throbbed. He answered :—
<lb/><q>One question will I put. Vouchsafe to tell me


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.489"/>


<lb/>the truth. Inform me of thy parentage,
<lb/>and make me happy by thy fair reply.
<lb/>I think that thou art <persName>Rustam</persName>, that thou art
<lb/>sprung from the noble race of <placeName>Narwan</placeName>.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>The other answered him: <q>I am not <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>not sprung from <persName>Sam</persName> the son of <placeName>Narwan</placeName>,
<lb/>for <persName>Rustam</persName> is a paladin, while I
<lb/>am mean, not having throne and state and crown.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> despaired, he had had hope before,
<lb/>the face of day was bright to him no more.

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> fought with <persName>Suhrab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName>, still musing on his mother’s words,

<lb/>went spear in hand. They chose a battle-ground ,

<lb/>where room was scant, and fought with javelins

<lb/>till points and whipping broke; next, wheeling leftward,

<lb/>closed with their Indian <sic>scimitars</sic> and showered

<lb/>sparks from their blades, which shivered 'neath such strokes

<lb/>as might have heralded the Day of Doom;

<lb/>then took their massive <sic>maces</sic> and fought on

<lb/>until their weapons bent beneath the blows.

<lb/>The chargers staggered and their bards dropped off;

<lb/>the riders raged beneath their shivered mail ;

<lb/>both were <sic>fordone</sic> and hand and arm both failed.

<lb/>With bodies running sweat, with mouths dust-choked,

<lb/>and tongues thirst-cracked, at length the champions parted,

<lb/>the sire in anguish and the son exhausted.

<pb n="163"/>


</p><p>


<lb/>O world! thy doings are a mystery,
<lb/>the broken and the whole both cone from thee!
<lb/>Love stirred in neither of these twain, no trace
<lb/>of wisdom was there, love showed not its face!
<lb/>The fish in streams, wild asses on the plain,
<lb/>and beasts of burden know their young again,
<lb/>but toil and lust forbid a man to know
<lb/>the difference between a child and foe!



</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.490"/><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> thought: <q>I never yet beheld 
<lb/>a Crocodile fight thus. Compared with this
<lb/>to fight the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> was an easy task:
<lb/>to-day my heart <sic>despaireth</sic> through a man!
<lb/>The hand of one who is unpractised yet,
<lb/>no warrior and not named among the chiefs,
<lb/>hath made me weary of my life in sight
<lb/>of both the hosts!</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>The chargers being rested,

<lb/>the youthful hero and the man in years
<lb/>strung up their bows, but still the coats of mail,
<lb/>the breastplates, and the tiger-skin cuirass
<lb/>received no injury from the arrow-points,
<lb/>and then each hero, raging at his foe,
<lb/>seized on the other by the leathern belt.
<lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName>, had he clutched a rock in battle,
<lb/>fen the Black Stone itself,<ref target="n.163.1"/> had torn it out,
<lb/>but when he seized the belt and would <sic>unhorse</sic>
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName>, the young man’s waist felt not the tug,
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName>’s hand was foiled. He quitted hold,
<lb/>he marvelled at the prowess of his foe,
<lb/>and then these lion-<sic>quellers</sic>, satiate
<lb/>with battle, bruised, and wounded drew apart.
<lb/>Suhradb again took from his saddle-bow
<lb/>the massive mace, and gripping with his legs
<lb/>smote <persName>Rustam</persName> grievously upon the shoulder,
<lb/>who though he winced yet bravely bare the pain.

<note xml:id="n.163.1">A meteorite built into the wall of the Kaaba at Mecca.</note>

<pb n="164"/>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> laughed out and cried: <q>O cavalier!
<lb/>Thou canst not bear the buffets of the brave.
<lb/>Thy charger, one would say, is but an ass ;
<lb/>as for the rider both his hands are naught.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.491"/>

<lb/>A warrior though cypress-tall is foolish
<lb/>to play the youth when he is in his dotage.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>Each humbled by the other turned away.
<lb/>They parted, troubled both in heart and mind.
<lb/>Like leopard sighting prey the mighty <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>went to attack the army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>while brave <persName>Suhrab</persName> assailed the Iranian host
<lb/>and gave his fleet steed rein. He charged the foe
<lb/>and many a warrior perished by his hand.
<lb/>Wolf-like he scattered small and great. The heart
<lb/>of <persName>Rustam</persName> boded ill, <q><persName>Kaus</persName> will suffer,</q>
<lb/>He thought, <q>from this brave <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> just arrived
<lb/>with mail-clad breast and arms.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>He hasted back
<lb/>to camp with anxious heart. There mid the host
<lb/>he saw <persName>Suhrab</persName>—a lion mad for prey—
<lb/>the ground about him tulip-<sic>hued</sic> with blood,
<lb/>his spearpoint, hands, and mail all drenched with gore.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> raging like a furious lion
<lb/>exclaimed : <q> Bloodthirsty <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>! who of all
<lb/>this host opposed thee? Why hast thou not kept
<lb/>thy hands for me instead of coming thus
<lb/>like wolf among a flock ?</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>The army of <placeName>Turan</placeName> is holding back
<lb/>from strife, and doing nothing to provoke it,
<lb/>yet thou began’st it by <sic>assailing</sic> them

<lb/><q>Light <sic>faileth</sic>,</q> <persName>Rustam</persName> said. <q>On its return

<lb/>for all the bright world <sic>yieldeth</sic> to the sword,
<lb/>and if thine arms are so familiar

<pb n="165"/>
<lb/>with scimitar and arrow never die!

<p>

<lb/>They parted and the air’s face <sic>gloomed</sic>. <persName>Suhrab</persName>
<lb/>amazed the circling sphere. Thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q> Heaven fashioned him of war; he <sic>ceaseth</sic> not
<lb/>a moment from the fray; his form is brazen,
<lb/>his charger iron, and his spirit wondrous.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> when night fell joined his troops. His loins
<lb/>were galled with battle but his breast was iron.
<lb/>Thus spake he to <persName>Human</persName>: <q> This day the sun
<lb/>Avose and filled the world with war and strife.
<lb/>How fared ye with this gallant cavalier
<lb/>who hath a hero’s heart and lion’s claws?
<lb/>What did he say and do? He proved my match!
<lb/>How fared my troops with him? I hold him peerless,
<lb/>though old a Lion bent on war and strife.</q>


</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.493"/><p>
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> replied: <q>Thou bad’st us tarry here. 
<lb/>Just as we had made ready for the field
<lb/>a warrior came and challenged us to combat,
<lb/>confronting all this mighty armament.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>He cometh fresh from wine
<lb/>to venture all alone on such a struggle.</q>
<lb/>he raised the dust of war on every side
<lb/>and slaughtered many warriors of our camp,
<lb/>then turning round departed at full speed.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> said: <q>He hath slain no man of mark
<lb/>while I have slaughtered many <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>and puddled with their blood the ground to clay,
<lb/>while ye looked on. However, none opposed me ;
<lb/>'Twas well none did, for had a lion come

<pb n="166"/>

<lb/>he would not have escaped my massive mace.
<lb/>What is a tiger, <sic>pard</sic>, or mighty lion
<lb/>confronting me who with my spearpoint bring
<lb/>fire from the clouds? When warriors behold
<lb/>my visage in its wrath their mail is shivered.
<lb/>To-morrow morning ere it is high day
<lb/>it will be seen which is the better man,
<lb/>and by the Maker’s name—the only God—
<lb/>I will not leave a foe alive. Now spread we
<lb/>the board with meat and wine, and cheer our hearts.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> reached the host he questioned <persName>Giv</persName> :—
<lb/><q>What did <persName>Suhrab</persName> the daring warrior?</q>


</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.494"/><p>

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> answered : <q> We ne’er saw one fight like him.
<lb/>He rode up to our centre spear in hand,
<lb/>and raging; there he challenged <persName>Tus</persName>, who wolf-like
<lb/>came forth and mounted. When <persName>Suhrab</persName> beheld him
<lb/>advancing with his lance he roared as '<sic>twere</sic>
<lb/>a lion in its rage, and with bent mace
<lb/>struck <persName>Tus</persName> upon the breast a mighty blow
<lb/>that made his helm fall off. <persName>Tus</persName> turned and fled.
<lb/>Then many others fought but none prevailed,
<lb/>for only <persName>Rustam</persName> can contend with him,
<lb/>I kept the good old rule of one to one,
<lb/>when no more single challengers went forth
<lb/>we let him have the field all to himself,
<lb/>whereat he left the centre for the right
<lb/>and flourished in his glory here and there.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName> <sic>sorrowed</sic> at the words of <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>and went to Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>, who seated him
<lb/>upon the throne. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> told the Shah
<lb/>about <persName>Suhrab</persName>, his stature, and his mien :—
<lb/><q> None ever saw one of his tender years
<lb/>so brave and lion-like. In height he <sic>reacheth</sic>
<lb/>the stars; the earth can not support his bulk;
<lb/>his arms and thighs are camel-like and larger.
<lb/>With sword and shaft, with lasso and with mace,

<pb n="167"/>

<lb/>we proved each other lustily in all ways
<lb/>until at last I said: <q>Ere now have I
<lb/>plucked from the saddle many a warrior,</q>
<lb/>and laying hold upon his leathern belt
<lb/>I put the buckle to a mighty strain,
<lb/>and fancied: <q>I shall raise him from his saddle
<lb/>and hurl him like the rest to dust.</q> But though

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.495"/>
<lb/>the mountain-tops were rocking in the blast 
<lb/>that chieftain would not rock upon his seat,
<lb/>and so I quitted him, for it was late,
<lb/>the night was very dark, there was no moon;
<lb/>but we intend to meet again to-morrow
<lb/>to wrestle. All I can I will, but know not
<lb/>which will prevail. Still we shall learn God’s purpose,
<lb/>for victory and conquest are from Him
<lb/>who is the Maker of the sun and moon.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> replied: <q>God rend our foes
<lb/>in pieces! I will pray to Him to-night
<lb/>for victory o’er this vile, malignant <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>,
<lb/>pray that thy withered hopes may spring afresh,
<lb/>and that thy fame may reach the sun.</q>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> :—

<lb/><q>Thy <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> will speed thy liege’s whole desire.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He went depressed and vengeful to his camp.
<lb/>To him <persName>Zawara</persName> came with downcast soul,
<lb/>and said: <q>How fared the paladin to-day?</q>
<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> first would eat, then washed his heart
<lb/>of care and charged his brother, saying thus :—
<lb/><q> Be vigilant and cautious. When I go
<lb/>at dawn to fight that <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> warrior
<lb/>lead out mine army and bring forth my flag,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.496"/>
<lb/>my throne, and golden boots, and be before 
<lb/>my tent when bright Sol <sic>riseth</sic>. IPfI prove
<lb/>victorious in the fight I shall not loiter
<lb/>upon the battlefield, while if the matter
<lb/>have other ending make no lamentation



<pb n="168"/>

<lb/>and be not downcast. Let not any of you
<lb/>go on the field or prosecute the war,

<lb/>but go hence to <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName> to <persName>Zal</persName>,

<lb/>console my mother for my God-sent fate,
<lb/>and say to her: <q>Set not thy heart upon me,
<lb/>and be not always mourning for my death.
<lb/>No one <sic>abideth</sic> in this world for ever,

<lb/>heaven had no pretext left to spare me longer.

<lb/>I have slain lions, <sic>pards</sic>, <sic>divs</sic>, crocodiles

<lb/>enough, and razed full many a wall and stronghold,

<lb/>while no man had the upper hand of me,

<lb/>though he that <sic>mounteth</sic> on his steed and <sic>chargeth</sic>

<lb/>is simply knocking at the door of death.

<lb/>What though a man outlive a thousand years

<lb/>one road and one event are for us all.

<lb/>Bethink thee of <persName>Jamshid</persName> the exalted Shah,

<lb/>and <persName>Tahmuras</persName> the Binder of the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>,

<lb/>there was no monarch like them here below,

<lb/>and yet at last God took them. As the earth

<lb/>remained not theirs I too must pass away.</q>

<lb/>when she hath been consoled thus say to <persName>Zal</persName>:—

<lb/><q>Abandon not the monarch of the world,

<lb/>fight for him valiantly and do his bidding.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.497"/>
<lb/>No one <sic>abideth</sic> in this world for ever.</q></q>



</p><p>

<lb/>We all, both young and old, are doomed to die;
<lb/>they rested after half the night had gone


<lb/>in talk about <persName>Suhrab</persName> and him alone.

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
<head>How <persName>Suhrab</persName> overthrew <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>The bright sun shone, the raven night flew low,
<lb/>great <persName>Rustam</persName> donned his tiger-skin cuirass
<lb/>and mounted on his fiery dragon-steed.

<lb/>Two leagues divided host from host, and all
<lb/>stood ready-armed. The hero with a <sic>casque</sic>

<pb n="169"/>

<lb/>of iron on his head came on the field.
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> on his side revelling with comrades
<lb/>had thus addressed <persName>Human</persName>: <q> That lion-man,
<lb/>who <sic>striveth</sic> with me, is as tall as I am
<lb/>and hath a dauntless heart. He <sic>favoureth</sic> me
<lb/>in shoulder, breast, and arm, and thou wouldst say
<lb/>that some skilled workman laid us out by line.
<lb/>His very feet and stirrups move my love
<lb/>and make me blush, for I perceive in him
<lb/>the marks whereof my mother spake. Moreover
<lb/>my heart <sic>presageth</sic> that he must be <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>for few resemble him. I may not challenge
<lb/>my sire or lightly meet him in the combat.</q>



</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.498"/><p>
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> said: <q> <persName>Rustam</persName> oft hath countered me: 
<lb/>this charger is like his, except in action.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>At sunrise, when they woke, <persName>Suhrab</persName> arrayed
<lb/>himself in mail and <sic>mirthful</sic> though resolved
<lb/>set forward shouting, ox-head mace in hand.
<lb/>He greeted <persName>Rustam</persName> smiling, thou hadst said
<lb/>that they had passed the night in company :—
<lb/><q>How went the night? How is’t with thee to-day?
<lb/>Why so intent on strife? Fling down thine arrows
<lb/>and scimitar, and drop the hand of wrong.
<lb/>Let us dismount and, sitting, clear our faces
<lb/>with wine, and, <sic>leaguing</sic> in God’s sight, repent
<lb/>our former strife. Until some other cometh
<lb/>to battle feast with me because I love thee,
<lb/>and weep for <sic>shamefastness</sic>. In sooth thou <sic>comest</sic>
<lb/>from heroes and wilt tell me of thy stock,
<lb/>for as my foe thou <sic>shouldst</sic> not hide thy name.
<lb/>Art thou the famous <persName>Rustam</persName> of <placeName>Zabul</placeName>,
<lb/>the son of valiant <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName> ?</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q> Young aspirant! heretofore
<lb/>we talked not thus but spake last night of wrestling.
<lb/>I am not to be gulled, attempt it not.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.499"/>
<lb/>Though thou art young I am no child myself, 


<pb n="170"/>

<lb/>but girt to wrestle, and the end shall be
<lb/>according to the will of Providence.
<lb/>I have known ups and downs, and am not one
<lb/>to practise guile upon.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Subrib replied :—
<lb/><q>Old man! if thou <sic>rejectest</sic> my proposals .. .!
<lb/>I wished that thou <sic>shouldst</sic> die upon thy bed,
<lb/>and that thy kin should tomb thy soulless corpse,
<lb/>but I will end thee if it be God’s will.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>They lighted, tied their chargers to a rock,
<lb/>and cautiously advanced in mail and <sic>casque</sic>
<lb/>with troubled hearts. They wrestled like two lions
<lb/>until their bodies ran with sweat and blood.
<lb/>From sunrise till the shadows grew they strove
<lb/>until <persName>Suhrab</persName>, that maddened Elephant,
<lb/>reached out, up-leaping with a lion’s spring,
<lb/>caught <persName>Rustam</persName>’s girdle, tugged <sic>amain</sic> as though,
<lb/>thou wouldst have said, to rend the earth, and shouting
<lb/>with rage and vengeance hurled him to the ground,
<lb/>raised. him aloft and, having dashed him down,
<lb/>sat on his breast with visage, hand, and mouth
<lb/>Besmirched with dust, as when a lion <sic>felleth</sic>
<lb/>an <sic>onager</sic>, then drew a bright steel dagger

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.500"/>
<lb/>to cut off <persName>Rustam</persName>’s head, who seeing this
<lb/>exclaimed: <q>Explain I must! O warrior
<lb/>that <sic>takest</sic> Lions captive and art skilled
<lb/>with lasso, mace, and scimitar! the customs
<lb/>and laws of arms with us are not as yours.
<lb/>In wrestling none may take a <sic>foeman</sic>’s head
<lb/>the first time that his back is on the ground,
<lb/>but having thrown him twice and won the name
<lb/>of Lion then he may behead the foe:
<lb/>such is our custom.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Thus he sought to 'scape
<lb/>the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s clutches and get off with life.
<lb/>The brave youth <sic>hearkened</sic> to the old man’s words.

<pb n="171"/>

<lb/>in part through confidence, in part through fate,
<lb/>in part no doubt through magnanimity,
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> let <persName>Rustam</persName> go, turned toward the plain,
<lb/>pursued an antelope that crossed his path,
<lb/>and utterly forgot his recent foe.
<lb/>When he was far away <persName>Human</persName> came up
<lb/>as swift as dust and asked about the fight.
<lb/>He told <persName>Human</persName> what had been said and done,
<lb/>who cried: <q> Alas! young man! art thou indeed
<lb/>so weary of thy life? Woe for thy breast,
<lb/>mien, stature, stirrups, and heroic feet!
<lb/>The mighty Lion whom thou hadst ensnared
<lb/>thou hast let go and all is still to do.
<lb/><rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs> how he will <sic>entreat</sic> thee on the day
<lb/>of battle owing to thy senseless act.
<lb/>A king<ref target="n.171.1"/> once spake a proverb to the point :—
<lb/><q>Despise not any foe however weak.</q></q>



</p><p>

<lb/>He took the very life out of <persName>Suhrab</persName>,
<lb/>who standing sorrowing and amazed replied :-—
<lb/><q> Let us dismiss such fancies <sic>froin</sic> our hearts,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.501"/>
<lb/>for he will come to fight with me to-morrow, 
<lb/>and thou shalt see a yoke upon his neck.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>He went to camp in dudgeon at his deed.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> had escaped his <sic>foeman</sic>’s clutch
<lb/>he was again as '<sic>twere</sic> a mount of steel.
<lb/>He went toward a rivulet as one
<lb/>who having fainted is himself again.
<lb/>He drank and bathed, then prayed to God for strength
<lb/>and victory, not knowing what the sun
<lb/>and moon decreed, or how the turning sky
<lb/>would rob him of the Crown upon his head.
<lb/>The tale is told that <persName>Rustam</persName> had at first
<lb/>such strength bestowed by Him who giveth all
<lb/>that if he walked upon a rock his feet
<lb/>would sink therein. Such puissance as that
<note xml:id="n.171.1"><persName>Zahhak</persName>. See vol. i. p. 154.</note>

<pb n="172"/>

<lb/>proved an abiding trouble, and he prayed
<lb/>to God in bitterness of soul to <sic>minish</sic>
<lb/>his strength that he might walk like other men.
<lb/>According to his prayer his mountain-strength
<lb/>had shrunk, but face to face with such a task,
<lb/>and pierced by apprehension of <persName>Suhrab</persName>,
<lb/>he cried to God and said: <q> Almighty Lord !
<lb/>Protect Thy slave in his extremity.
<lb/>O holy Fosterer! I ask again
<lb/>my former strength.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>God granted him his prayer,
<lb/>the strength which once had waned now waxed in him.
<lb/>He went back to the field perturbed and pale
<lb/>while, like a maddened elephant, <persName>Suhrab</persName>,
<lb/>with lasso on his arm and bow in hand,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.502"/>

<lb/>came in his pride and roaring like a lion,
<lb/>his plunging charger flinging up the soil.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> saw the bearing of his foe
<lb/>he was astound and gazing earnestly
<lb/>weighed in his mind the chances of the fight.
<lb/>Subrab, puffed up with youthful arrogance,
<lb/>on seeing <persName>Rustam</persName> in his strength and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,
<lb/>cried: <q>Thou that didst escape the Lion’s claws!
<lb/>Why com’st thou boldly to confront me? Speak!
<lb/>Hast thou no interests of thine own to seek ?</q>

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21">
<head>How <persName>Suhrab</persName> was slain by <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>They tied their steeds while fate <sic>malignantly</sic>
<lb/>revolved o’<sic>erhead</sic>, and when dark fate is <sic>wroth</sic>

<lb/>flint rocks become like wax, The two began’

<lb/>to wrestle, holding by their leathern belts,

<lb/>as for <persName>Suhrab</persName> thou wouldst have said: <q>High heaven
<lb/>hath hampered him,</q> while <persName>Rustam</persName> reaching clutched
‘hat warrior-leopard by the head and neck,

<pb n="173"/>

<lb/>bent down the body of the gallant youth,
<lb/>whose time was come and all whose strength was gone,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.503"/>
<lb/>and like a lion dashed him to the ground; 
<lb/>then, knowing that <persName>Suhrab</persName> would not stay under,
<lb/>drew lightly from his waist his trenchant sword
<lb/>and gashed the bosom of his gallant son.

</p><p>

<lb/>Whenever thou dost thirst for blood and stain
<lb/>therewith thy glittering dagger, destiny


</p><p>

<lb/>Will be <sic>athirst</sic> for thy blood, and ordain
<lb/>each hair of thine to be a sword for thee.


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> cried: <q>Ah!</q> and writhed. Naught <sic>recked</sic> he then
<lb/>of good or ill. <q>I am alone to blame,</q>
<lb/>He said to <persName>Rustam</persName>. <q>Fate gave thee my key.
<lb/>This hump-backed sky reared me to slay me soon.
<lb/>Men of my years will mock me since my neck
<lb/>hath thus come down to dust. My mother told me
<lb/>how I should recognise my father. I
<lb/>sought him in love and die of my desire.
<lb/>Alas! my toils are vain, I have not seen him.
<lb/>Now wert thou fish, or wrapped like night in gloom,
<lb/>or quit of earth wast soaring like a star,
<lb/>my father would avenge me when he <sic>seeth</sic>
<lb/>my pillow bricks. Some chief will say to <persName>Rustam</persName> :—
<lb/><q><persName>Suhrab</persName> was slain and flung aside in scorn
<lb/>while seeking thee.</q></q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> grew distraught,

<lb/>the world <sic>tuened</sic> black, his body failed; o’<sic>ercome</sic>
<lb/>he sank upon the ground and swooned away ;
<lb/>till coming to himself he cried in anguish :-—
<lb/><q> Where is the proof that thou art <persName>Rustam</persName>’s son ?
<lb/>May his name perish from among the great,
<lb/>for I am <persName>Rustam</persName>! Be my name forgotten,
<lb/>and may the son of <persName>Sam</persName> sit mourning me!</q>


</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.504"/><p>
<lb/>He raved, his blood seethed, and with groans he plucked 

<pb n="174"/>

<lb/>his hair up by the roots, while at the sight
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> sank swooning till at length he cried :-—
<lb/><q>If thou indeed art <persName>Rustam</persName> thou hast slain me
<lb/>in wanton malice, for I made advances, -
<lb/>but naught that I could do would stir thy love.
<lb/>Undo my breastplate, view my body bare,
<lb/>behold thy jewel, see how sires treat sons!
<lb/>The drums beat at my gate, my mother came
<lb/>with blood-stained cheeks and stricken to the soul
<lb/>because I went. She bound this on mine arm
<lb/>and said : <q>Preserve this keepsake of thy father’s
<lb/>and mark its virtue.</q> It is mighty now,
<lb/>now when the strife is over and the son
<lb/>is nothing to his sire.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> loosed
<lb/>the mail and saw the gem he rent his clothes,
<lb/>and cried : <q>Oh! my brave son, approved by all
<lb/>and slain by me!</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>With dust upon his head
<lb/>and streaming face he rent his locks until
<lb/>his blood ran down.



</p><p>

<lb/><q>Nay, this is worse and worse,</q>
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName> said. <q>Wherefore weep? Whait will it profit
<lb/>to slay thyself? What was to be hath been.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>When day declined and <persName>Rustam</persName> came not back
<lb/>there went forth twenty trusty warriors
<lb/>to learn the issue. Both the steeds were standing
<lb/>Bemoiled with dust, but <persName>Rustam</persName> was not there.
<lb/>The nobles, thinking that he had been slain,
<lb/>went to <persName>Kaus</persName> in consternation saying :—
<lb/><q>The throne of majesty is void of <persName>Rustam</persName> !</q>


</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.505"/><p>
<lb/>A cry went up throughout the host and all
<lb/>was in confusion. Then <persName>Kaus</persName> bade sound
<lb/>the drums and trumpets, <persName>Tus</persName> came, and the Shah
<lb/>said to the troops: <q> Dispatch a messenger
<lb/>that he may find out what <persName>Suhrab</persName> hath done,

<pb n="175"/>

<lb/>and if there must be mourning through <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>None will confront him with brave <persName>Rustam</persName> dead.
<lb/>We must attack in force and speedily.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>While clamour raged <persName>Suhrab</persName> said thus to <persName>Rustam</persName> :—
<lb/><q>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' case is altered since my day
<lb/>is done. Use all thine influence that the Shah
<lb/>may not attack them. They approached <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>through trust in me, and I encouraged them.
<lb/>How could I tell, O famous paladin!
<lb/>That I should perish by my father’s hand ?
<lb/>Let them depart unscathed, and treat them kindly.
<lb/>I had a warrior in yonder hold
<lb/>caught by my lasso. Him I often asked
<lb/>to point thee out: mine eyes looked ever for thee.
<lb/>He told me all but this. His place is void.
<lb/>His words o’er-cast my day, and I despaired.
<lb/>See who he is and let him not be harmed.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.506"/>
<lb/>I marked in thee the tokens that my mother 
<lb/>described but trusted not mine eyes. The stars
<lb/>decreed that I should perish by thy hand.
<lb/>I came like lightning and like wind I go.
<lb/>In heaven I may look on thee with joy.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> choked, his heart was full of fire,
<lb/>his eyes of tears. He mounted quick as dust
<lb/>and came with lamentations to the host
<lb/>in grievous consternation at his deed.
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> catching sight of him fell prostrate
<lb/>and gave God praise that <persName>Rustam</persName> had returned,
<lb/>but when they saw the dust upon his dead,
<lb/>his clothes and bosom rent, they questioned him :
<lb/><q>What <sic>meaneth</sic> this? For whom art thou thus troubled ?</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>He told the fearful deed, and all began
<lb/>to mourn aloud with him. His anguish grew.
<lb/>He told the nobles: <q>I have lost to-day

<note xml:id="n.175.1"><q>La place que je <sic>lui</sic> <sic>avais</sic> <sic>destinge</sic> <sic>reste</sic> <sic>vide</sic>.</q>—MOHL.</note>

<pb n="176"/>


<lb/>all strength and courage. Fight not with <placeName>Turan</placeName>:
<lb/>I have done harm enough.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Zawara</persName> came
<lb/>with breast and raiment rent and body wounded,
<lb/>whom <persName>Rustam</persName> told about his slaughtered son,
<lb/>and added: <q>I repent me of my deed,
<lb/>and have unmeasured retribution. I
<lb/>have slain my son now when my head is grey.
<lb/>He is cut off both root and stem, his loins
<lb/>are pierced, and heaven will weep for him for ever.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>He sent and told <persName>Human</persName>: <q>The scimitar


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.507"/>

<lb/>of war is sheathed and thou <sic>commandest</sic> now.
<lb/>Watch o’er thy host. This is no day for fight
<lb/>or further words with thee because through malice
<lb/>thou didst not speak but sear my life and eyes.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Then to <persName>Zawara</persName> said the paladin :—
<lb/><q>Escort <persName>Human</persName>, brave hero! to the river,
<lb/>eschewing every act of violence.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Zawara</persName> went forthwith and gave the message,
<lb/>and be—the warrior that taught <persName>Suhrab</persName>
<lb/>the art of war—thus answered: <q>'Twas <persName>Hajir</persName>,
<lb/>that evil-<sic>purposed</sic> stirrer up of strife,
<lb/>who hid the matter of your general,
<lb/>and when <persName>Suhrab</persName> sought token of his sire
<lb/>spake not but left his mind in ignorance.
<lb/>The black behaviour of <persName>Hajir</persName> hath brought
<lb/>this ill onus. His head should be struck off.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>Zawira came back to inform the hero
<lb/>about <persName>Human</persName>, the host, of what <persName>Hajir</persName>,
<lb/>the evil and malevolent, had done,
<lb/>and how <persName>Suhrab</persName> had perished by his means.
<lb/>The hero was distracted at the words,
<lb/>the world grew dark before his eyes, he quitted
<lb/>the battlefield and coming to <persName>Hajir</persName>
<lb/>laid hold upon his throat and threw him down,
<lb/>then drawing forth a dagger of bright steel

<pb n="177"/>

<lb/>was minded to behead him, but the nobles 
<lb/>took part with him and saved him from death’s door.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> hurried to his wounded son
<lb/>with <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Gustaham</persName>, while all
<lb/>the troops, concerned for <persName>Rustam</persName>, said to him :—
<lb/><q> God will provide a remedy for this,
<lb/>and make thy sorrow easy.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> seized
<lb/>a dagger to behead himself, but weeping
<lb/>their own hearts' blood the chieftains hung on him.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.508"/>
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> said: <q> Will it help thee to send up

<lb/>a hundred harms, how will it soothe thy darling ?
<lb/>If there <sic>remaineth</sic> time for him on earth
<lb/>he will remain; do thou remain with him ;

<lb/>We are the quarry, and death <sic>hunteth</sic> us
<lb/>no matter whether we wear <sic>casque</sic> or crown,
<lb/>but all are borne out when their end hath come,
<lb/>and afterward we wot not how they do,

<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Who hath lustre in my sight
<lb/>exceeding that of elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> ?
<lb/>I do not wish him ill but honour him


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.509"/>

<lb/>exceedingly, yet, if I send the elixir,
<lb/><persName>Suhrab</persName>—an elephantine chief—will live,
<lb/>will strengthen <persName>Rustam</persName>’s back, and doubtlessly
<lb/>bring ruin on myself. If at his hands
<lb/>I suffer shall I not avenge myself ?
<lb/><q>Who is <persName>Kaus</persName>,</q> thou <sic>heardest</sic> him once say,

<lb/>who in this wide world hath such neck and limbs
<lb/>and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>? How will he stand before my throne,
<lb/>or march beneath the banner of the Shahs ?
<lb/>He gave me his abuse and took away
<lb/>my credit with the troops. If his son <sic>liveth</sic>
<lb/>a pinch of dust is all that I shall get.
<lb/>Art thou of high rank and experience
<lb/>and hast not heard the language of <persName>Suhrab</persName> :—

<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> lamented for <persName>Suhrab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> called for an embroidered robe
<lb/>and, having laid the youth thereon, set off,
<lb/>but as he went one overtook him, saying :—
<lb/><q>Suhrdb hath passed from this wide world, and <sic>asketh</sic>
<lb/>no more a palace of thee but a bier.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The father started, sighed, and groaning closed
<lb/>his eyes, then lighting swift as wind removed
<lb/>his helm and scattered dust upon his head,
<lb/>while all the great men also wept and wailed.
<lb/>He cried in mournful tones: <q>O warrior-youth
<lb/>exalted and a paladin by birth!
<lb/>The sun and moon, the breastplate and the helm,
<lb/>the crown and throne, will never see thy peer.
<lb/>Hath this that hath befallen me—to slay
<lb/>my son in mine old age—befallen another ?
<lb/>My son—the offspring of the <sic>worldlord</sic> <persName>Sam</persName>
<lb/>the cavalier, born of a noble dame!
<lb/>I, that have now no peer in all the world
<lb/>for valour, was a boy to him! Well might
<lb/>my hands be lopped! May never seat be mine

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.511"/>
<lb/>save in the <sic>darksome</sic> dust. What shall I say 
<lb/>when tidings reach his mother? How shall I
<lb/>send any one to break the news to her ?
<lb/>What reason can I give for slaying one
<lb/>without offence and darkening his day ?
<lb/>What sire e’<sic>ér</sic> acted thus? I well deserve
<lb/>the world’s abuse. Who ever slew a son
<lb/>so young and wise and valiant? And his mother!

<pb n="180"/>

<lb/>what will her sire, that honoured paladin,
<lb/>say to her in her youth and innocence ?
<lb/>How they will curse the progeny of <persName>Sam</persName>
<lb/>and call me <sic>lacklove</sic>, impious! Who could deem
<lb/>that at his years my darling would become
<lb/>tall as a cypress, set his heart on war,
<lb/>array the host, and turn my day to darkness?</q>
<lb/>He bade them spread brocade such as kings use
<lb/>upon his young son’s face—that son who set
<lb/>his heart on throne and realm and only won
<lb/>a narrow bier. They bore it from the field,
<lb/>then set the camp-enclosure in a blaze
<lb/>while all the troops cast dust upon their heads.
<lb/>They burned the tents, the many-<sic>hued</sic> brocade,
<lb/>and all the goodly seats of yellow <sic>pardskin</sic>.
<lb/>A cry went up and mighty <persName>Rustam</persName> wailed :—
<lb/><q>The world will see no cavalier like thee
<lb/>for skill and valour on the day of battle.
<lb/>Woe for thy valour and thy prudent mind!
<lb/>Woe for those cheeks of thine, thy mien, thy stature!
<lb/>Woe’s me! this sorrow and heart-rending grief!
<lb/>He left his mother and his father slew him :</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>With royal raiment rent upon his body
<lb/>and weeping blood he scrabbled in the dust


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.512"/>
<lb/>exclaiming: <q> <persName>Zal</persName> and virtuous <persName>Rudaba</persName>
<lb/>will utter curses, saying: <q><persName>Rustam</persName> gained
<lb/>the mastery and stabbed him to the heart.</q>
<lb/>what plea of mine will win their hearts to me?
<lb/>How will the chieftains bear to hear that I
<lb/>have rooted from the garth the straight-stemmed cypress ?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then all the paladins of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>sat by the wayside in the dust with <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>and much advised him, but he heeded not.


</p><p>

<lb/>Such are high heaven’s deeds! It hath for us
<lb/>a lasso in this hand, in that a crown,

<pb n="181"/>


</p><p>


<lb/>And him that <sic>sitteth</sic> crowned and prosperous
<lb/>it <sic>haleth</sic> with the twisted lasso down.
<lb/>Why should we love this world when we and they
<lb/>that fare with us alike must pass away ?
<lb/>Though one may reckon on long life he must
<lb/>Betake him in the last resort to dust.
<lb/>Now whether heaven <sic>acteth</sic> knowingly,
<lb/>or not, 'tis vain to ask its how and why;
<lb/>forbear we then to weep that one should go:
<lb/>the end thereof is not for us to know.


</p><p>

<lb/>The Shah informed about <persName>Suhrab</persName> drew near
<lb/>to <persName>Rustam</persName> with his retinue and said :—
<lb/><q>From Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName> e’en to the reed the sky

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.513"/>
<lb/>will bear all off. We may not set our love 
<lb/>upon this dust, for, though some haste, some linger,
<lb/>all die at last. Take comfort for the dead,
<lb/>and hear what sages say. Though thou <sic>shouldst</sic> dash
<lb/>the sky upon the earth and burn the world
"Twill not recall the dead. Know that his soul
<lb/>is long in heaven. From afar I marked
<lb/>his breast, neck, stature, and his iron mace
<lb/>as fate impelled him onward with his host
<lb/>to perish by thy hands. What remedy?
<lb/>How long wilt thou bewail the dead ?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He answered :—
<lb/><q> Though he is gone <persName>Human</persName> <sic>remaineth</sic> still
<lb/>with other chieftains of <placeName>Turan</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>Regard them not as foes but let Zawira,

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> replied: <q> Aspiring chief! thy face

<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> returned to <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></head>
<p>

<lb/>The Shah marched homeward with the host, while <persName>Rustam</persName>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.514"/>

<lb/>stayed for <persName>Zawara</persName>’s news about the foe,

<lb/>then marched at dawn toward <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>,

<lb/>where <persName>Zal</persName> and all the folk went out to meet him

<lb/>in anguish and distress. They reached the bier.

<lb/>The nobles scattered dust upon their heads,

<lb/>they docked the tails of their high-crested steeds,

<lb/>and rent the brazen <sic>tymbals</sic> and the drums.

<lb/>When <persName>Zal</persName> the son of Sim perceived the bier

<lb/>he lighted from his steed with golden trappings,

<lb/>while matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> went in front afoot

<lb/>with heart and raiment rent. The warriors

<lb/>put off their belts, stooped to the dust before it,

<lb/>and served as bearers, bending low their heads,

<lb/>alas! for him so noble and so brave !

<lb/>While <persName>Rustam</persName> in his father’s presence lifted

<lb/>his son’s head from the golden <sic>broidery</sic>,

<lb/>and cried in anguish; <q>See how Sim the horseman

<lb/>is sleeping sadly on this narrow bier!</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> showered tears of blood and <sic>plained</sic> to God,
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> cried: <q>Chief! thou hast gone, and I
<lb/>am left in shame and wretchedness.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Zal</persName> :—
<lb/><q> A strange event! His was a massive mace.
<lb/>He was of note among the mightiest,
<lb/>and none will bear his like.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He spoke through tears ;

<lb/>his theme was all <persName>Suhrab</persName>. When <persName>Rustam</persName> reached

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.515"/>
<lb/>his hall he wailed and had the <sic>corse</sic> set down
<lb/>in front of him. <persName>Rudaba</persName>, seeing it
<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName>’s tears, exclaimed: <q> Alack! thou hero!

<pb n="183"/>

<lb/>uplift thy head one moment from the bier.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>She wailed and heaving deep-drawn sighs exclaimed :—

<lb/><q>Q paladin, son of the Lion’s Whelp!
<lb/>None will be born so strong and brave as thou.
<lb/>Henceforth thou wilt not whisper to thy mother
<lb/>tales of thy happy moments, for in sooth
<lb/>thou hast departed to the prison-house,
<lb/>departed to the mansion of the wretched. a
<lb/>oh tell not what befell thee from thy father,
<lb/>and why it was that thus he pierced thy heart!</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Her cries reached <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> ; all that heard her wept.
<lb/>Dust-<sic>smirched</sic> and woebegone she sought her bower
<lb/>while <persName>Rustam</persName> at the sight wept tears of blood.

<lb/>Thou wouldst have asked: <q> Hath Doomsday come, for Joy
<lb/>hath fled all hearts ?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Again he brought the bier,
<lb/>whereon <persName>Suhrab</persName> the Lion lay, before
<lb/>the gallant chiefs, and in his father’s presence
<lb/>drew back the shroud. He showed the chiefs the <sic>corse</sic>,
<lb/>and thou hadst said that heaven reeked with sorrow.
<lb/>All that were present looked on helplessly,
<lb/>all cheeks were livid, all robes rent, all hearts
<lb/>fulfilled with pain, all heads <sic>besmirched</sic> with dust.
<lb/>The royal palace was one mighty bier,
<lb/>and of that valiant Lion in his coffin

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.516"/>
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>Tis' Sim with his huge limbs,

<lb/>and tired with warfare he hath <sic>gone‘to</sic> sleep.</q>

<lb/>The sire replaced the gold brocade and closed
<lb/>the narrow bier. He said: <q>Though I shall make
<lb/>his tomb of gold and fill it round with musk
"Twill perish with me, but I can no more.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>While all went blind with grief he made a charnel
<lb/>shaped like a horse’s hoof. The bier was formed

<pb n="184"/>

<lb/>of <sic>undried</sic> aloe-wood with golden clasps.

</p><p>


<lb/>The tale of how the paladin had slain
<lb/>his son went everywhere and all the world
<lb/>was full of grief, while <persName>Rustam</persName> <sic>sorrowed</sic> long,
<lb/>but in the end perforce resigned himself.

<lb/>For who <sic>possesseth</sic> sense and wit combined

<lb/>of wail and woe, and swooned at whiles. She coiled
<lb/>her hair like twisted <sic>lassos</sic> round her fingers

<lb/>and plucked it out. The blood ran down her face.
<lb/>At times she sank <sic>fordone</sic>. She strewed dark dust
<lb/>upon her head, gnawed pieces from her arms,
<lb/>flung fire upon her head and scorched herself,

<lb/>and burned her musky tresses. <q>Where art thou,</q>
<lb/>She cried, <q>who wast thy mother’s soul, but art

<lb/>hast thou been round the world to find thy father,

<lb/>hast found him, and art speeding home again.</q>

<lb/>how could I know, my son! that news would come

<lb/>that he had pierced thy liver with his sword ?

<lb/>He had no pity for that face of thine,

<lb/>thy stature, mien, and arms, he pitied not

<lb/>thy <sic>girdlestead</sic> but <sic>clave</sic> it with his blade.

<lb/>I used to nurse the body of my boy

<lb/>through days of brightness and through weary nights,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.518"/>
<lb/>and now 'tis drowned in blood! A winding-sheet 

<lb/>is all the cover of his stainless form.

<lb/>Whom shall I clasp upon my bosom now ?

<lb/>Who is there that will rid me of my grief?

<lb/>Whom shall I call upon to take thy place?

<lb/>To whom impart my pain and misery ?

<lb/>Woe for his soul and body, eye and lustre,

<lb/>that dwell in dust instead of hall and garden!

<lb/>O warrior, shelter of the host! thou <sic>soughtest</sic>

<lb/>thy sire and in his place hast found thy grave.

<lb/>Hope turned in thee to dolorous despair,

<lb/>and now thou <sic>sleepest</sic> scorned and miserable

<lb/>and gashed thy <sic>silvern</sic> side why didst not thou

<lb/>This said she tore herself, plucked out her hair,

<lb/>and smote her lovely visage with her palms,

<lb/>she filled the eyes of all the folk with hail,

<lb/>so grievous were her moans and lamentations.
<lb/>At length while all hearts ached she fell a-swoon,

<lb/>fell as one <sic>falleth</sic> dead upon the ground,
<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q> Her blood is turned to ice.</q>
<lb/>She roused, thought of her son, and wailed afresh,

<lb/>She fetched his crown, wept o’er it and his throne,
<lb/>exclaiming in her grief : <q>Q royal Tree!</q>
<lb/>She brought his wind-foot charger forth, that charger
<lb/>which he had prized so in his happy days,
<lb/>and clasped and kissed its head, to folk’s amazement,
<lb/>and nuzzled on its hoofs, while her blood fell
<lb/>and reddened all the ground. She took his robe
<lb/>and clasped it to her body like her son,
<lb/>she fetched his jerkin, coat of mail, and bow,
<lb/>his spear, his <sic>falchion</sic>, and his massive mace.
<lb/>She fetched his saddle with the reins and buckler,
<lb/>and dashed her head thereon. She fetched his lasso,

<lb/>She fetched his helm and breastplate, and exclaimed :—

<lb/>She locked the palace, rooted up the throne,

<lb/>Now from this history my face I turn:
<lb/>the tale of <persName>Siyawush</persName> is my concern.

<pb n="188"/>

<div type="textpart" n="16siavosh"><head>Part IV: the story of <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>

<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>

<p>The poet, inspired by his theme and conscious of his genius, retells an ancient tale thus :—</p>

<p><persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>, while hunting, find and quarrel about a damsel. The matter is referred to the Shah, who marries her himself. From this union springs <persName>Siyawush</persName>, who is brought up by <persName>Rustam</persName> and afterward returns to his father’s court, where <persName>Sudaba</persName>, one of his father’s wives, tempts him in vain and then accuses him falsely. He clears himself by ordeal and saves his accuser’s own life, which had been adjudged forfeit for her wickedness. In time she is restored to favour, and <persName>Siyawush</persName>, to escape her wiles, leads an army against <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, who, terrified by a dream, sues for peace. The terms granted by <persName>Siyawush</persName> are rejected by the Shah, and <persName>Siyawush</persName>, his honour touched, goes over to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, by whom he is well received and whose daughter <persName>Farangis</persName> he marries, having previously married <persName>Jarira</persName>, the daughter of <persName>Piran</persName>. He attains to great dignities, but incurs the envy of the king’s brother, <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, by whom he is done to death. His wife <persName>Farangis</persName> is protected by <persName>Piran</persName> and gives birth to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, with whose childhood the story ends.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p><persName>Firdausi</persName>, as we may gather from his prelude, thought highly of his version of this tragic story, which, unlike that of <persName>Suhrab</persName>, is not a pure episode, but leads directly, though by a long road, to the chief epic climax. It also affords a good example of the poet's treatment of his subject-matter. Various legends are combined with curious results. For instance, the legend of the birth of <persName>Siyawush</persName> from a grand-daughter of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> is not allowed to militate against or to modify other legends in which ancestor and descendant meet on equal terms, in the full vigour of manhood, as



<pb n="189"/>

strangers ignorant of their blood-relationship, as enemies, as villain and victim. Such instances are the surest guarantee that the poet is drawing on epic sources and not on his own imagination. The story further shows how needful it is for a reader of the <persName>Shahnama</persName> mentally to supply for himself the element of time. The account of <persName>Sudaba</persName>’s infatuation for <persName>Siyawush</persName><ref target="n.189.1"/> reads as if it were a matter of a few days, weeks, or months at most. It is only from a chance remark of hers that we learn that the affair had been going on for seven years !</p>

<p>The temptation of <persName>Siyawush</persName> by <persName>Sudaba</persName>, on which so much turns, will suggest many a parallel to the reader.</p>



<p>It should be mentioned, however, that <persName>Sudaba</persName>’s pretext for inviting <persName>Siyawush</persName> to visit her—the suggested marriage of one of her daughters to him—was a legitimate one to a Zoroastrian.</p>

<p><persName>Sudaba</persName>’s daughter would be <persName>Siyawush</persName>’s half-sister, and next-of-kin marriages, as they were called, were not only permitted but regarded as a sacred duty by the Magi.<ref target="n.189.2"/> <persName>Sudaba</persName>, with the wit of a woman much in love, hit upon a perfectly legitimate motive, and <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> accepted it, as we see, without the least suspicion.

</p>

<p><persName>Siyawush</persName> appears as Sydvarshina in the Zandavasta, where he is several times mentioned in connection with his murder by <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> and <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, and the vengeance exacted for it by <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, who, we are told, <q>prevailed over all ; he put in bonds <persName>Frangrasyan</persName> and <persName>Keresavasda</persName>, to avenge the murder of his father <persName>Syavarshana</persName>.</q> <ref target="n.189.3"/> Here, as in other cases, the leading motives of the <persName>Shahnama</persName> originate in the Zandavasta.</p>

<p>§ 49. The poet in his description of <placeName>Gang-dizh</placeName> perhaps had in his mind the famous stronghold of Kalat-i-Nadiri, which lies about thirty miles to the north of <placeName>Mashad</placeName> and not far from the poet’s own birthplace, but he follows his authorities, which look at matters from a point of view west of the <placeName>Caspian</placeName>, and describes <placeName>Gang-dizh</placeName>as being beyond the sea accordingly. Tradition seems to place it in <placeName>Kharazm</placeName>. In the Zandavasta we read of <q>the castle <placeName>Khshathré-saoka</placeName>, that stands high up on the lofty, holy <placeName>Kangha</placeName>.</q><ref target="n.189.4"/> In the Dina-i Mainog-i Khirad, a Pahlavi treatise, <persName>Siyawush</persName> is described as the founder of <placeName>Kangdez</placeName>, and <placeName>Kangdez</placeName> itself is described as lying to the east, on the frontier of Airan-<sic>vego</sic>.<ref target="n.189.5"/> In the Bundahish it is described as being in the direction of the east, <q>at many leagues from the bed of the wide-formed ocean towards that side.</q> <ref target="n.189.6"/> Now the learned Abu Raihan <persName>Muhammad</persName>, more commonly known in the west as <persName>Albiruni</persName>, was a native of Khirazm and wrote a

history of that country. His account is nearly all lost, but in another work of his he tells us that the <rs type="ethnic">Kharazmians</rs> dated the colonisation of their country from the year 980 before Alexander, i.e. from the fourteenth century b.c., and that ninety-two years later the incursion of <persName>Siyawush</persName> took place. From this time onward they were governed by monarchs of his race down to the days of king
<lb/><persName>Afrigh</persName>—a man of evil reputation—who built himself a fortress on the outskirts of the city of <placeName>Kharazm</placeName>, or made additions to an existing fortress, called <placeName>Alfir</placeName>, in the year 616 of the era of Alexander, 2.¢. toward the end of the third century a.p. This <placeName>Alfir</placeName>, <persName>Albiruni</persName> tells us, was built of clay and tiles, and consisted of three forts, one inside another, and all of equal height. Rising above the whole were the royal palaces. <placeName>Alfir</placeName> could be seen at a distance of ten miles or more. It was broken and shattered by the <placeName>Oxus</placeName>, and was swept away piece by piece every year, till the last remains of it had disappeared by the year 1305 of the era of Alexander, 2.¢. toward the end of the tenth century a.d.<ref target="n.190.1"/> It is evident from this account that <placeName>Alfir</placeName> was in process of construction or enlargement in the very century in which the Zandavasta was being compiled. The <rs type="ethnic">Kharazmians</rs> had racial affinities with the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, and the epithet <q>holy</q> applied to <placeName>Kangha</placeName> in the Zandavasta evidently points to the fact that they were Zoroastrians as well. It may be therefore that the Khshathré-saoka of the Zandavasta, the <placeName>Kangdez</placeName> of the Pahlavi texts, the <placeName>Alfir</placeName> of <persName>Albiruni</persName>, and the <placeName>Gang-dizh</placeName>of the <persName>Shahnama</persName> all represent one and the same place—the <sic>palace-fortress</sic> of the ancient capital of <placeName>Kharazm</placeName>. <placeName>Kharazm</placeName> is, of course, the modern <placeName>Khiva</placeName>, and <placeName>Gang-dizh</placeName>means the fortress (<foreign>dizh</foreign>) of the land of <placeName>Kangha</placeName>.</p>

<p>§ 58 seg. In the account of the birth and youth of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> we have in essentials the same story as that told by <persName>Herodotus</persName><ref target="n.190.2"/> some fifteen centuries earlier, <persName>Astyages</persName>, the king of the <rs type="ethnic">Medes</rs>, had a daughter <persName>Mandane</persName>. He had a dream about her which he told to Magi who were learned in such matters. Their interpretation of it alarmed lim, and as the safest course in the <sic>circumstauces</sic> he married his daughter to an unambitious Persian of good family named <persName>Cambyses</persName>. Soon after <persName>Astyages</persName> had another dream about <persName>Mandane</persName>. He again consulted the dream-interpreters, who told him that his daughter's son would supersede him on the throne. In consequence of this prognostic he sent for <persName>Mandane</persName>, who was dwelling among the <rs type="ethnic">Persians</rs>, and had her closely guarded. When her son <persName>Cyrus</persName> was born, <persName>Astyages</persName> summoned <persName>Harpagus</persName>, a member of the royal house and a most loyal liege, and ordered him to take

the child from <persName>Mandane</persName>, to kill it, and to bury it. <persName>Harpagus</persName>, in great distress, carried off the child, who was ready clad in funeral weeds, to his own home, but told his wife that nothing should induce him to make away with the infant himself, for they were akin to each other. Accordingly he sent for one of the herdsmen of <persName>Astyages</persName>, whose herds were pastured on the mountains north of <placeName>Ekbatana</placeName>, in the direction of the <placeName>Euxine</placeName>—a tract frequented by wild beasts—and bade him expose the child on some desolate spot that it might soon perish. Now, it so happened that the herdsman’s wife had lately had a still-born babe, and when she saw <persName>Cyrus</persName> she persuaded her husband to expose the dead and allow her to keep the living child. The son of <persName>Mandane</persName> thus grew up in the house of the herdsman, and his royal birth soon began to assert itself. His playmates chose him for their king, and he used to hold mock court among them. At length an incident brought the matter to the ears of <persName>Astyages</persName>, who questioned the herdsman and was exceedingly <sic>wroth</sic> with <persName>Harpagus</persName>. The interpreters of dreams, however, declared that no further danger was to be apprehended from <persName>Cyrus</persName>, as the dream had been sufficiently fulfilled by his election to kingship by his play-fellows. Accordingly <persName>Astyages</persName> sent him back to
Persia to his parents <persName>Cambyses</persName> and <persName>Mandane</persName>. Subsequently <persName>Cyrus</persName>, incited by <persName>Harpagus</persName>, rebelled and overthrew <persName>Astyages</persName>.

<lb/>In the <persName>Shahnama</persName> we have <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> for <persName>Astyages</persName>, <persName>Farangis</persName> for
<lb/><persName>Mandane</persName>, <persName>Siyawush</persName> for <persName>Cambyses</persName>, Khusrau for <persName>Cyrus</persName>, and <persName>Piran</persName> for <persName>Harpagus</persName>, while, if the view be correct that the so-called empire of the <rs type="ethnic">Medes</rs> was in reality the empire of the <rs type="ethnic">Manda</rs>,<ref target="n.191.1"/> one important discrepancy between the Greek and Persian accounts is removed, for <persName>Astyages</persName>, <persName>Mandane</persName>, and <persName>Harpagus</persName> become Turanian instead of Median, and are thus brought into line with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, <persName>Farangis</persName>, and <persName>Piran</persName>, their representatives in the <persName>Shahnama</persName>.</p>

<head>The Story of the Mother of <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Thus said an <sic>archimage</sic>: One morning <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>in merry pin left the Shah’s gate at <sic>cockcrow</sic>,
<lb/>with <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and other cavaliers,
<lb/>to hunt upon the desert of <placeName>Daghwi</placeName>
<lb/>with hawk and cheetah. By a river’s bank
<lb/>they stalked or ran down game, and caught or shot
<lb/>enough to last them forty days. Near by
<lb/>a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>’s camp showed black, and thence a forest
<lb/>stretched almost to the marches of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> led the way with <persName>Tus</persName>: behind them came
<lb/>some brave retainers, Entering the wood,
<lb/>and roaming thus awhile in quest of quarry,
<lb/>they saw among the trees a fair-<sic>cheeked</sic> maiden,
<lb/>and hurried toward her in high glee. The age
<lb/>had not her peer in looks; hers were not charms
<lb/>to need apologies. In stature she

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.525"/>
<lb/>was cypress-tall, in looks a moon, to gaze 
<lb/>on her was perilous. <persName>Tus</persName> said to her :—
<lb/><q> Bewitching Moon! who showed thee to this wood ?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><q> My father set on me last night,</q> she said,
<lb/><q> And so I fled from home. He had returned
<lb/>drunk from a marriage-feast and, in his frenzy
<lb/>perceiving me far off, drew forth his sword
<lb/>of watered steel and had beheaded me.
<lb/>I fled for refuge, and have just come hither.</q>

<lb/>The paladin then asked her of her kindred,
<lb/>she told him fully and to this effect —
<lb/><q>I am akin to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, and trace
<lb/>my lineage to Shah <persName>Faridun</persName>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He asked her :—

<lb/><q>Why <sic>camest</sic> thou afoot, for thou hast come

<lb/>unmounted and unguided ?</q>


<pb n="194"/>


</p><p>

<lb/>She replied :—
<lb/><q> My steed was wearied out and fell exhausted.
<lb/>I had uncounted gold, gold crown, and jewels,
<lb/>but over yonder hill some people robbed me
<lb/>and beat me with a scabbard. I escaped
<lb/>in terror and am weeping tears of blood.
<lb/>My sire no doubt when sober will dispatch
<lb/>some horsemen after me forthwith, my mother
<lb/>will haste to me, she would not have me quit
<lb/>these fields and fells.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Now both the paladins
<lb/>grew hot of heart for love of her, and <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>lost to all shame, exclaimed : <q>'Twas I who spied her,
<lb/>and therefore made such haste.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Giv</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>O captain of the host! without thy host
<lb/>thou art no match for me.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Still <persName>Tus</persName> insisted :—

<lb/><q>She came exactly in my horse’s way.</q>

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> said: <q>Nay! Say not so; I led the chase.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.526"/>
<lb/>Tell not a falsehood for a slave-girl’s sake:
<lb/>a man of courage is not quarrelsome.</q>

<lb/>Their wrangle was so violent that the Moon
<lb/>was like to lose her head in the dispute,
<lb/>until a noble interposed and said :—
<lb/><q>Convey her to the monarch of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and bide by his decision.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Both agreed

<lb/>and went to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, who when he saw

<lb/>the damsel’s beauty, fell in love with her

<lb/>himself, and said to those two generals :—

<lb/><q> Your journey’s travail was cut short for you!

<lb/>Be she a doe or beautiful gazelle

<lb/>a quarry such as this is for your lord.

<lb/>Come let us pass the day in telling how

<lb/>these warriors with their cheetahs caught a Sun!</q>

<pb n="195"/>


</p><p>

<lb/>He questioned her: <q> What is thy lineage,
<lb/>for thou art fairy-like in countenance?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><q>I am of high birth on my mother’s side,</q>
<lb/>She said, <q> my father sprang from <persName>Faridun</persName>.
<lb/>My father’s father is prince <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>whose tents now occupy yon border land.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> said: <q> Didst thou mean to fling away
<lb/>such looks as these, such beauty and such birth?
<lb/>'Tis meet I place thee in my golden bower:

<lb/>thou must be chief of all the Moon-faced there.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>She answered: <q>I preferred thee at first sight
<lb/>among the great.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The Shah then gave each general
<lb/>ten noble chargers with a throne and crown,
<lb/>but sent the Idol to the women’s bower,
<lb/>and gave command to set her on the throne.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.527"/>
<lb/>Then under her they placed an ivory seat, 
<lb/>upon her head a crown of gold and turquoise,
<lb/>adorning her with yellow-<sic>hued</sic> brocade,
<lb/>with jewels, turquoise, lapis lazuli,
<lb/>and other presents worthy hers to be:
<lb/>a ruby yet untouched by man was she.

<head>The Birth of <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>When nine months had elapsed, and <sic>jocund</sic> spring
<lb/>resumed its tints, men said to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Thou hast had fruit of that auspicious Moon:

<lb/>a glorious infant hath appeared, and now

<lb/>thou well <sic>mayst</sic> set thy throne above the clouds.
<lb/>A babe of fairy-form is born to her,

<lb/>in visage like an idol of <placeName>Azar</placeName>,<ref target="n.195.1"/>

<lb/>with face and hair unheard of heretofore,

<lb/>and all the folk are talking of the child.</q>

<pb n="196"/>

<p>
<lb/>The world-lord named him <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and gave
<lb/>the rolling heaven praise because of him;
<lb/>yet they that read the purpose of the sky,
<lb/>its good and evil and its when and how,
<lb/>saw that the stars were hostile to the boy,
<lb/>and grieved because they saw his fortune sleeping.
<lb/>They turned to God for refuge, warned the Shah
<lb/>about the fortune of his son, and showed
<lb/>the path to take, aware that he would suffer
<lb/>from good and bad. Anon came peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>



<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.528"/>

<lb/>before the Shah and said: <q> Mine be the task
<lb/>to rear this child that is so lion-like;
<lb/>since thy retainers are not competent
<lb/>there is no nurse on earth for him like me.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch, having pondered much thereon,
<lb/>entrusted little loath his heart and eyes—
<lb/>this <sic>atheling</sic>, the child so loved by him—
<lb/>to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s charge, who bore him to <placeName>Zabul</placeName>
<lb/>and lodged him in a rosary, instructed
<lb/>the youth in riding, archery, the use
<lb/>of lasso, stirrups, reins, and other gear,
<lb/>to hold his court, his feasts, and drinking-bouts,
<lb/>to follow game with falcon, hawk, and cheetah,
<lb/>to judge in causes, and to rule the kingdom,

<lb/>make speeches, combat, and lead forth a host:

<lb/>all these accomplishments did <persName>Rustam</persName> teach him,

<lb/>and took abundant pains which bore their fruit,
<lb/>for <persName>Siyawush</persName> became a peerless prince,
<lb/>and, as time passed, grew tall and captured lions.
<lb/>One day he spake to noble <persName>Rustam</persName> thus :—
<lb/><q> Desire to see the Shah hath come on me.
<lb/>Much travail and heart-burning hast thou borne
<lb/>to teach me all a king’s accomplishments:
<lb/>my father must examine the result
<lb/>of elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>’s tutelage.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>The lion-hearted hero made all ready,

<pb n="197"/>
<lb/>and sent posts everywhere. Of horses, slaves,
<lb/>gold, silver, <sic>signets</sic>, <sic>falchions</sic>, crowns, and girdles,
<lb/>and various stuffs and linings, he produced
<lb/>Whate’er he could himself or got elsewhere.
<lb/>On this wise <persName>Rustam</persName> furnished forth the youth,
<lb/>for all men’s eyes were fixed on <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and also journeyed with him lest the Shah
<lb/>might be offended. As their custom was

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.529"/>
<lb/>the folk put decorations everywhere 
<lb/>in their desire to please the paladin,
<lb/>the townsmen mingled gold and <sic>ambergris</sic>,
<lb/>and showered them on the travellers' heads for joy,
<lb/>the world grew full of mirth and precious <sic>havings</sic>,
<lb/>each mansion’s door and roof were decked, the feet
<lb/>of <persName>Rustam</persName>’s <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steeds trod <sic>drachms</sic>. Men saw

<lb/>to come in triumph to the Shah, for they

<lb/>and access given, Slaves with censers charged

<lb/>with folded arms. Three hundred filled the court

<lb/>when he beheld <persName>Kaus</persName> upon his throne
<lb/>of ivory and crowned with brilliant rubies,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.530"/>
<lb/>for in that height, that stature, and that <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>
<lb/>the Shah foresaw a future and much fame.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said of one so young yet wise :—
<lb/><q> His soul is fed on wisdom.</q> So the Shah,
<lb/>with face upon the ground, gave many praises
<lb/>to God and said: <q>Great Ruler of the sky,
<lb/>the Lord of understanding and of love!
<lb/>All good things come from Thee, but most of all
<lb/>I thank Thee for my child.</q>

<lb/>The Iranian chiefs,

<lb/>they marvelled at the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and called a wealth of blessings down on him.
<lb/>Then by the Shah’s command the noblemen

<lb/>his palace, and his hall, with right good cheer.
<lb/>Men called for wine and harp and <sic>minstrelsy</sic>.
<lb/>The Shah’s festivities were such as none

<lb/>Upon the eighth day he unlocked his treasures,

<lb/>When all was ordered as the Shah had bidden

<lb/>the prince’s mother passed away. The prince

<lb/>Go now and visit those secluded ones,
<lb/>and stay awhile that they may do thee honour.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The prince beheld his father with amazement,
<lb/>then mused awhile and strove to clear himself,
<lb/>suspecting that his father sought to prove him ;
<lb/>for <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> was knowing and smooth-tongued,
<lb/>wise, shrewd of heart, and ready to distrust.
<lb/>The prince was troubled, <sic>communed</sic> with himself,
<lb/>and in the end determined.

</p><p>
<lb/><q>If,</q> he thought,

<lb/><q>I go <persName>Sudaba</persName> will talk much with me,</q>
<lb/>Then said: <q>The Shah hath given me a patent,
<lb/>a throne, and crown. From where the lofty sun
<lb/>arising maketh dust a thing of price
<lb/>no king resembling thee in goodness, knowledge,
<lb/>demeanour, and pursuits, e’er donned the crown.
<lb/>Point me the way to sages, men of leading,
<lb/>and chiefs approved; or show me how to handle
<lb/>spear, mace, or bow and arrow, midst the foe;
<lb/>or be it king-craft and court-usages,
<lb/>or feast and harp, or wine and revellers ;
<lb/>but in the women’s quarters of the Shah
<lb/>what shall I learn? Shall women point the way
<lb/>to knowledge? Yet if so the Shah <sic>commandeth</sic>
<lb/>my custom henceforth is to visit them.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.534"/><p>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Be happy, O my son! 

<pb n="202"/>


<lb/>may wisdom rest upon thee! I have heard
<lb/>but seldom such fair words. Thy brain will grow
<lb/>since thou art thus amenable. Dismiss
<lb/>all ill <sic>surmises</sic> from thy heart, away
<lb/>with trouble, and enjoy thyself. Look in
<lb/>upon the children just for once: perchance
<lb/>it will divert them somewhat.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><q>I will go,</q>
<lb/>Said <persName>Siyawush</persName>, <q>to-morrow and perform
<lb/>the Shah’s command. Behold I stand before thee
<lb/>devoted, heart and soul, to do thy bidding.
<lb/>As thou <sic>requirest</sic> so will I behave,
<lb/>thou art the world-lord; I am but a slave.</q>

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> visited <persName>Sudaba</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>One named <persName>Hirbad</persName>, purged heart and brain and soul
<lb/>from evil, never left the Idol-house,
<lb/>and kept the key. The Shah commanded him :—
<lb/><q>What time the sun shall draw the sword of day
<lb/>seek <persName>Siyawush</persName> and further his commands.
<lb/>Instruct <persName>Sudaba</persName> to present to him
<lb/>a gift of gems and musk, and let withal
<lb/>his sisters and the slaves pour emeralds
<lb/>and saffron over him.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>When Sol o’<sic>ertopped</sic>

<lb/>the mountains <persName>Siyawush</persName> approached the Shah
<lb/>and did obeisance. When they had conversed
<lb/>awhile in private <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> instructed
<lb/><persName>Hirbad</persName>, then said to <persName>Siyawush</persName>: <q>Go with him
<lb/>and be prepared to look on something new.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The twain went off together merrily
<lb/>without a thought of care; but when <persName>Hirbad</persName>

<pb n="203"/>


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.535"/>
<lb/>held up the veil that hung before the door 
<lb/>the mind of <persName>Siyawush</persName> <sic>foreboded</sic> ill.
<lb/>The women came before him one and all
<lb/>in festival attire to gaze at him ;
<lb/>the house was full of musk, dinars, and saffron,
<lb/>and at his feet they strewed <sic>drachms</sic>, gold, and gems:
<lb/>the floor was covered with brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>enriched with lustrous pearls. Wine, scent, and voice
<lb/>of <sic>minstrelsy</sic> were there, all heads were crowned
<lb/>with jewels; 'twas like Paradise, replete
<lb/>with lovely forms and sumptuous furniture.
<lb/>Now <persName>Siyawush</persName> on entering the bower
<lb/>beheld a brightly shining, golden throne,
<lb/>with patterns wrought in turquoise, royally
<lb/>draped with brocade. There sat moon-faced <persName>Sudaba</persName>,
<lb/>like Paradise itself in hue and perfume,
<lb/>sat like the bright <rs type="heavenlybody">Canopus</rs> of <placeName>Yaman</placeName>,
<lb/>her head adorned with ringlets, curl on curl.
<lb/>Surmounted by a lofty crown her hair
<lb/>descended to her feet in musky <sic>lassos</sic>,
<lb/>a slave stood humbly by with golden slippers.
<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> appeared within the veil
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> hastened to descend the throne,
<lb/>advanced with graceful gait, saluted him,
<lb/>embraced him long, long kissed his eyes and face,
<lb/>and wearied not to look at him. She said :—
<lb/><q>I offer praise to God a hundred ways
<lb/>all day and three whole watches of the night,
<lb/>for no one hath a son resembling thee:
<lb/>the Shah himself hath not another such.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Now <persName>Siyawush</persName> knew well what that love meant,
<lb/>and that such fondness was not in the way
<lb/>of God, and, since it was unseemly there,
<lb/>went quickly to his sisters, who enthroned him
<lb/>with many a blessing on a golden seat.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.536"/>
<lb/>He stayed awhile, then went back to the Shah. 

<pb n="204"/>


<lb/>the bower was full of talk: the women said :-—
<lb/><q> Behold the head and crown of courtesy !
<lb/><q>He is not,</q> thou hadst said, <q>like other men:
<lb/>his soul <sic>diffuseth</sic> wisdom.</q></q>
</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>came to his father’s presence and spake thus :—
<lb/><q>I have beheld the veil and what it hid.
<lb/>All good things in the world are thine, no need
<lb/>for thee to vindicate the ways of God
<lb/>who dost in treasure, <sic>scimitars</sic>, and troops
<lb/>surpass <persName>Hushang</persName>, <persName>Jamshid</persName>, and <persName>Faridun</persName>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The Shah <sic>joyed</sic> at the words. He decked his palace
<lb/>like <sic>jocund</sic> spring, had wine and harp and things
<lb/>prepared, and banned the future from the heart.

</p><p>

<lb/>That night he went among his dames and talked
<lb/>thus with <persName>Sudaba</persName>: <q>Hide not what thou <sic>thinkest</sic>
<lb/>about the judgment and the courtesy
<lb/>of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, his stature, looks, and speech.

<lb/>Dost thou approve of him and is he wise ?
<lb/>Deserveth he what others say of him ?</q>
</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> answered: <q>Shah and people never
<lb/>saw thy like on the throne, and who is there
<lb/>to match thy son? Why speak with bated breath ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>If he is to live till manhood
<lb/>we must protect him from the evil eye.</q><ref target="n.204.1"/>

</p><p>
<lb/>She said: <q>If my words please, and if thy son
<lb/>and I are minded that I should bestow
<lb/>a wife upon him out of his own kindred,

<lb/>not from the great ones that are round about—
<lb/>a consort who shall bear to him a son

<lb/>such as he is himself among the mighty—
<lb/>then I myself have daughters like to thee,
<lb/>begotten of thy seed, of thy pure stock;

<lb/>or should he take a child of <persName>Kai Arash</persName>,

<lb/>or <persName>Kai Pashin</persName>, she would give thanks with joy.</q>

<note xml:id="n.204.1">Open praise, especially of the young, was regarded as unlucky.</note>

<pb n="205"/>
</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.537"/><p>
<lb/>He said to her: <q>It is my wish, My name 
<lb/>and greatness are dependent on the issue.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Next morning <persName>Siyawush</persName> approached the Shah,
<lb/>and called down blessings on the crown and throne.
<lb/>The monarch caused all strangers to depart
<lb/>and, speaking with his son in privacy,

<lb/>said thus: <q>I have in me a secret longing,
<lb/>inspired by God, the Maker of the world,
<lb/>that thou <sic>shouldst</sic> leave a memory of thy name,
<lb/>and that a king should issue from thy loins,
<lb/>that as my face refreshed at seeing thee,

<lb/>thy heart should be enlarged at sight of him.
<lb/>I had thy horoscope to this effect

<lb/>from <sic>archimages</sic> that can read the stars,
<lb/>that from thy loins a king shall come and be
<lb/>thy monument. Now choose thyself a wife
<lb/>among the great from those within the veil
<lb/>of <persName>Kai Pashin</persName> or bower of <persName>Kai Arash</persName> ;

<lb/>make all things ready and bestow thy hand.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He said: <q>I am the Shah’s slave and I bow
<lb/>my head before his counsel and behest.

<lb/>His choice for me is good, <sic>whoe</sic>’er she be ;
<lb/>the world-lord is a monarch o’er his slaves.
<lb/>Would that <persName>Sudaba</persName> heard it not! her words
<lb/>are otherwise, she hath no mind thereto;

<lb/>I <sic>cannot</sic> talk to her of this affair,

<lb/>and have no business in that bower of hers.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah smiled at the words of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>not <sic>witting</sic> of the <sic>quag</sic> beneath the straw,

<lb/>and said to him: <q>Thy wife must be thy choice.
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> least of all need be considered,
<lb/>her words are full of loving-kindliness ;
<lb/>she <sic>tendereth</sic> thy welfare.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>was gladdened by the words, and reassured

<lb/>yet privily <persName>Sudaba</persName> with her schemes

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> visited the Bower the second Time</head>
<p>

<lb/>Another night thus passed and starry heaven
<lb/>turned o’er dark earth. <persName>Sudaba</persName> radiant
<lb/>sat on her throne and donned a diadem
<lb/>of rubies. Then she summoned all her daughters,
<lb/>arrayed, and seated them on golden thrones.
<lb/>Before her stood young Idols: thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>It is a paradise.</q> The moon-faced lady
<lb/>said to <persName>Hirbad</persName>: <q>Go say to <persName>Siyawush</persName> :—
<lb/><q> Afflict thy feet and show thyself to me.</q></q>


</p><p>



<lb/><persName>Hirbad</persName> made speed to give that lover's message
<lb/>to <persName>Siyawush</persName> who, hearing, stood distraught,
<lb/>and oft invoked the Maker of the world.
<lb/>He sought in various ways but found no help ;
<lb/>he trembled, and his legs shook under him;
<lb/>then went to visit her and saw her state,
<lb/>her face, and diadem. She with her head
<lb/>and tresses decked with gems rose at his coming,
<lb/>gave up the throne of gold to him and, standing
<lb/>Slavelike, displayed her Idols—gems uncut,
<lb/><q> Behold this throne-room,</q> thus she said, <q>and all
<lb/>these handmaids with their golden coronets !
<lb/>They all are youthful Idols of <placeName>Taraz</placeName>,
<lb/>whom God hath formed of modesty and charms.
<lb/>If any one of them <sic>delighteth</sic> thee,
<lb/>survey her looks and form from head to foot.</q>



</p><p>


<lb/>While <persName>Siyawush</persName> was glancing lightly round
<lb/>there was not one who dared to catch his eye,

<pb n="207"/>

<lb/>and as they talked they said: <q> The moon itself
<lb/>would not presume to gaze upon this prince.</q>



</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.539"/><p>
<lb/>When each, in speculation on her chance, 
<lb/>had gone back to her seat, <persName>Sudaba</persName> said :-—
<lb/><q>Why dost thou keep thy purpose to thyself ?
<lb/>Wilt thou not tell me what is thy desire,

<lb/>o thou whose looks are fairy-like with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>!
<lb/>For all are struck who catch a glimpse of thee,
<lb/>preferring thee to any? Ponder well

<lb/>which of these beauties is the <sic>worthiest</sic>.</q>



</p><p>


<lb/>But <persName>Siyawush</persName> was moved and answered not,
<lb/>for thoughts like these arose in his pure heart :—
<lb/><q>Far better hold my pure heart’s funeral rites
<lb/>than take a consort from among my foes.

<lb/>I have been told by famous warriors

<lb/>of all the doings of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>,<ref target="n.207.1"/>

<lb/>how he entreated the Iranian king,

<lb/>and how he raised dust from the Iranian chiefs.
<lb/>This treacherous <persName>Sudaba</persName> is his daughter,

<lb/>and will not leave our kindred skin or marrow.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>He opened not his lips to make reply.

<lb/>The fairy-faced one raised her veil and said :—
<lb/><q>If one should see the new moon and the sun
<lb/>here upon this new throne, it would not be

<lb/>a marvel if the moon should be despised,

<lb/>and thou <sic>shouldst</sic> press the sun in thine embrace.
<lb/>No wonder if the man that <sic>seeth</sic> me

<lb/>upon the ivory throne, with rubies crowned
<lb/>and turquoise, should not look upon the moon,
<lb/>but think all other Beauties <sic>beautiless</sic>.

<lb/>If thou wilt make a compact with me now,
<lb/>turn not away but set my heart at rest,

<lb/>one of my youthful daughters present here
<lb/>will I make stand before thee like a slave.

<note xml:id="n.207.1">i.e. the king of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>—so King John, Act I. Sc. i. : <q>Now say, Chatillon, what would France with us?</q></note>

<pb n="208"/>

<lb/>so make a compact with me now by oath,
<lb/>and disregard no jot of what I say,
<lb/>that, when the Shah <sic>departeth</sic> from the world,
<lb/>thou wilt be his memorial with me,
<lb/>wilt never suffer me to come to harm,
<lb/>but hold me dear as life. And now behold!

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.540"/>

<lb/>I stand before thee and I give to thee
<lb/>myself and my sweet life. I will fulfil
<lb/>Whate’er thou <sic>asketh</sic> me—thy whole desire—
<lb/>and let my head be taken in thy toils.</q>



</p><p>


<lb/>She hung upon his neck, gave him a kiss,
<lb/>and of a truth forgot her modesty.
<lb/>He blushed ; the very lashes of his eyes
<lb/>were red with shame. He thought: <q>From this div’s work
<lb/>now may the Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> keep me far !
<lb/>I will not treat my sire <sic>disloyally</sic>,
<lb/>nor will I make a league with <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>.
<lb/>If I speak coldly to this wanton dame
<lb/>her heart will seethe ; she will grow hot with rage,
<lb/>make practice of some secret sorcery,
<lb/>and cause the world-lord to believe in her.
<lb/>'Tis best to speak her fair and keep her full
<lb/>of tenderness and longing.</q>

</p><p>



<lb/>Then he said :—

<lb/><q> Thou hast not any equal in the world,
<lb/>and art the rival of the moon itself
<lb/>in beauty: thou art for the Shah alone.
<lb/>As for myself thy daughter will suffice ;
<lb/>none other must be mine. Consent to this,
<lb/>propose it to the monarch of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and mark the answer that thou wilt receive.
<lb/>I will demand her and will covenant,
<lb/>and give a pledge before thee with my tongue,
<lb/>that till her stature <sic>equalleth</sic> mine own
<lb/>I will not think of any one besides.

<pb n="209"/>

<lb/>for what thou <sic>askest</sic> further—since my face
<lb/>Inspireth in thy soul a love for me—
<lb/>god’s <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> hath made me thus, O thou most fair!
<lb/>Conceal thy secret; speak of it to none:
<lb/>for me too silence is the only course.
<lb/>Thou art the chief of ladies and a queen,
<lb/>and I will think of thee as mother only.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>He spake these words and rose to go, but love
<lb/>still filled her wicked soul. When next <persName>Kaus</persName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.541"/>
<lb/>the monarch, visited the women’s bower, 
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> looked and saw him. She appeared
<lb/>before the Shah with news of what had passed,
<lb/>and spake thus of the case of <persName>Siyawush</persName> :—
<lb/><q> He came and looked all round the-hall. I made
<lb/>a bevy of the black-eyed Idols there.
<lb/>The hall was such with all the fair-faced girls
<lb/>that thou hadst said: <q>Love <sic>raineth</sic> from the moon!</q>
<lb/>but, save my daughter, he approved of none:
<lb/>no other fair was precious in his eyes.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>The Shah was so rejoiced that thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>The moon itself hath come to his embrace!</q>
<lb/>He <sic>oped</sic> his treasury’s door: a wealth of gems,
<lb/>brocade of cloth of gold, and golden girdles,
<lb/>as well as bracelets, crowns, and signet-rings,
<lb/>with thrones and torques such as the noble wear,
<lb/>and divers kinds of treasures were displayed,
<lb/>so that the world was filled with things of price.
<lb/>The Shah then bade <persName>Sudaba</persName>: <q> Keep all these
<lb/>for <persName>Siyawush</persName>. When he hath need of them,
<lb/>give them to him and say: <q>This gift is small ;
<lb/>thou <sic>shouldest</sic> have two hundred times as much.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> looked in wonder. Full of guile
<lb/>she thought: <q>If <persName>Siyawush</persName> <sic>complieth</sic> not,
<lb/>then he may take my life and welcome too.

<lb/>Each practice good and evil, which they use


<pb n="210"/>

<p>

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> sat enthroned, adorned with earrings
<lb/>and chaplet of wrought gold upon her head.
<lb/>She called the prince and said, as they conversed :—
<lb/><q>The Shah hath set these treasures forth, and none
<lb/>hath seen such crowns and thrones. The sum of gifts
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.542"/>
<lb/>is past all reckoning: to carry them
<lb/>thou wouldst require two hundred elephants,
<lb/>and I will give to thee my daughter too,
<lb/>now look upon my face and head and crown:
<lb/>what pretext hast thou to reject my love,
<lb/>and slight my face and person? I am dead
<lb/>not seeing thee; I cry out, toss, and suffer:
<lb/>the light of day is hidden by mine anguish,
<lb/>my sun is turned to lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>And now for seven years this love of mine
<lb/>hath made my face to run with tears of blood.
<lb/>Make me a happy woman—none shall know—
<lb/>vouchsafe to me a day of youth again.
<lb/>More than the great king hath bestowed on thee
<lb/>will I prepare thee—thrones, crowns, <sic>diadems</sic> ;
<lb/>but if thou turn aside from my behest,
<lb/>and if thy heart come not to my relief,
<lb/>I will destroy thy hope of ever reigning
<lb/>and make both sun and moon turn black before thee.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><q>Now God forbid,</q> he said, <q>that I should give
<lb/>religion to the winds for passion’s sake,

<pb n="211"/>

<lb/>that I should treat my sire <sic>disloyally</sic>,
<lb/>and be a coward and a fool at once!
<lb/>Thou art his wife—the sunlight of his throne—
<lb/>and <sic>shouldst</sic> not perpetrate a crime like this.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>She rose in wrath and hate, clutched him and cried :—
<lb/><q>I told thee my heart’s secret, but thine own
<lb/>was hidden! In thy folly thou dost aim
<lb/>to ruin me and show the wise my shame.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<head>How <persName>Sudaba</persName> beguiled <persName>Kaus</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>She rent her robes and tore her cheeks. A cry
<lb/>rose from her bower, her clamour reached the street.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.543"/>

<lb/>The palace was all hubbub; thou hadst said :— 
<lb/><q>'Tis Resurrection-night!</q> News reached the Shah,
<lb/>who hurried from the imperial golden throne
<lb/>toward the bower in his solicitude,
<lb/>and when he found <persName>Sudaba</persName> with rent cheeks,
<lb/>and all the palace full of <sic>babblement</sic>,
<lb/>he questioned every one in deep concern,
<lb/>not knowing what that Heart of stone had done.
<lb/>Suddba wailed and wept before him, tore
<lb/>her hair, and told him: <q><persName>Siyawush</persName> approached
<lb/>my throne. He caught me in his arms and cried :—
<lb/><q>My soul and body brim with love for thee.
<lb/>Oh! why art thou so cold to me, my fair!
<lb/>For thou art all I long for, thou alone ?</q>
<lb/>this is the truth—I am constrained to tell thee :-—
<lb/>'Twas he that threw the crown from my black locks,
<lb/>and rent the robe upon my bosom thus!</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>The Shah was troubled, asked her many questions,
<lb/>and thought: <q>If she saith sooth, and if she hath

<pb n="212"/>

<lb/>no evil end in view, I must cut off
<lb/>the head of <persName>Siyawush</persName>: that will unlock
<lb/>these bonds of villainy.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>What saith the sage ?

<lb/><q> Not lust but blood our thoughts must now engage.</q>

<lb/>The inmates of the bower, those well advised
<lb/>and noble servants faithful to their lord,
<lb/>he bade withdraw and, sitting on the throne
<lb/>alone, called. for <persName>Sudaba</persName> and his son,
<lb/>and wisely said to him: <q>I needs must know
<lb/>this secret. 'Twas not thou but I that wrought
<lb/>the ill. I suffer for my thoughtless words:
<lb/>why did I call thee to the women’s house ?
<lb/>Now I am grieved that thou art thus involved.
<lb/>Let me have all the truth, show me its face,
<lb/>and say what passed.</q>



</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.544"/><p>

<lb/>The prince related all,

<lb/>and how he had been wrought on by <persName>Sudaba</persName>.
<lb/>She cried: <q>It is a lie. Of all the Idols
<lb/>it was my person only that he sought;
<lb/>I told him what the king of earth proposed
<lb/>to give him publicly and privily,
<lb/>told him about my daughter and the crown,
<lb/>the precious things, brocade, and treasure-hoards.
<lb/>I told him: <q>I will add as much again,
<lb/>and give my daughter all that I possess.</q>
<lb/>he said to me: <q>I do not want the goods,
<lb/>and do not mean to see thy child. Of all
<lb/>the world,</q> he said, <q>I need but thee—no more.
<lb/>No wealth or personage <sic>availeth</sic> aught
<lb/>without thine own self.</q> Then he tried to force me,
<lb/>and handled me with hands as hard as stones.
<lb/>I would not grant his wishes. All my hair
<lb/>he tore and caused these scratches on my face.
<lb/>I am with child, O monarch of the world!
<lb/>By thee, but he was near to killing it

<pb n="213"/>

<lb/>with all his struggles, and the world was strait
<lb/>and dark before me.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then the great king thought :—

<lb/><q>The testimony of them both is worthless,
<lb/>and this is not a case for <sic>instancy</sic>,
<lb/>because a heart in straits <sic>perverteth</sic> wisdom.
<lb/>I needs must first investigate the matter,
<lb/>and when my heart is calm it will bear witness ;
<lb/>I shall discover which is in the wrong,
<lb/>and which of them <sic>deserveth</sic> punishment.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He sought all means of finding out the truth,
<lb/>and first he smelt the hands of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>his breast, his arms, his head, and all his person.
<lb/>A scent of wine, rose-water, and tine musk
<lb/>was on <persName>Sudaba</persName>, but on <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>was none, nor any sign that he had touched her,
<lb/>the Shah was troubled, he disgraced <persName>Sudaba</persName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.545"/>
<lb/>and sorely vexed said to himself: <q>No course 
<lb/>Remaineth but to put her to the sword.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then he bethought him of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>,
<lb/>how tumult, strife, and battle would ensue ;
<lb/>next, how, when he was lying there in bonds
<lb/>and none of all his kin and friends was near,
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> was his handmaid day and night,
<lb/>and faced the trouble uncomplainingly.
<lb/>His next thought was: <q>She loved me wholly once:
<lb/>I must forgive her everything,</q> and then
<lb/>that he had children by her, and he counted
<lb/>the anguish of the children no light thing.
<lb/>But <persName>Siyawush</persName> was blameless in the case,
<lb/>the monarch recognised his probity,
<lb/>and said to him: <q>Be not concerned <sic>hereat</sic> ;

<head>How <persName>Sudaba</persName> and a Sorceress devised a Scheme</head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName>, conscious that she was disgraced

<lb/>and that the Shah’s heart was estranged from her,
<lb/>sought in her evil case some remedy,

<lb/>and set anew the tree of her revenge.

<lb/>She had a woman in the bower, adept

<lb/>in charms and spells, deceit and artifice,

<lb/>and one moreover who was great with child,

<lb/>near to the time of her delivery.
</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> told her all and sought her aid,

<lb/>but said: <q> First give a pledge of thy good faith.</q>
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> took her pledge, gave her much gold,
<lb/>and said: <q> Make mention of this thing to none.
<lb/>Prepare a drug that thou <sic>mayest</sic> make abortion,

<lb/>remain concealed, and keep my secret close.

<lb/>It may be that my coil of many lies

<lb/>may gain some credit through this babe of thine,

<lb/>for I will tell <persName>Kaus</persName>: <q>This is my child,

<lb/>thus murdered by the hand of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>!</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.546"/>
<lb/>this, it may be, will baffle <persName>Siyawush</persName> ;

<lb/>so seek a way to compass it. If thou

<lb/>Refusest then my lustre with the Shah

<lb/>is dimmed: I shall no more approach the throne.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The woman said to her: <q>I am thy slave,

<lb/>and bow my head to thy command and will.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>When it was night the woman took the drug

<lb/>and gave birth to a brood of Ahrimans—

<lb/>two children as they had been div-begotten:

<lb/>what should a sorceress and a div produce ?

<lb/>Then, saying nothing to her servitors,<ref target="n.214.1"/>

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> had a golden salver brought

<lb/>whereon she laid those brats of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>,

<note xml:id="n.214.1">Reading with P.</note>

<pb n="215"/>

<lb/>and shrieked and flung herself upon a couch.

<lb/>She hid the woman and retired to bed:

<lb/>her wailing reached the palace from her chamber.
<lb/>Then all the slaves within the palace came

<lb/>in haste before <persName>Sudaba</persName>, they beheld

<lb/>two infants lying dead upon the salver,

<lb/>and cries rose o’er the palace and o’er <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>.

<lb/>The sound of wailing reached and woke <persName>Kaus</persName>

<lb/>who listened trembling, asked, and heard how fortune
<lb/>had dealt with his fair spouse. Sleepless and anxious
<lb/>he rose at dawn, went in and saw <persName>Sudaba</persName>

<lb/>prostrate, the women frantic, and two babes

<lb/>in evil plight, flung on a golden salver!

<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> rained the water from her eyes,

<lb/>and said: <q> Behold this bright sun—<persName>Siyawush</persName> !

<lb/>I often told thee of his evil deeds,

<lb/>but thou didst foolishly believe his words.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The heart of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> was filled with doubt,
<lb/>he went his way, remained a while in thought,
<lb/>then said: <q>What remedy shall I apply ?

<lb/>I must not treat the case with levity.</q>

<p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> then summoned all the astrologers 
<lb/>before him, welcomed them, assigning each

<lb/>a golden throne, and spake about <persName>Sudaba</persName>,

<lb/>and of the warfare with <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>,

<lb/>that they might have a knowledge of her case,

<lb/>and understand her conduct thoroughly ;

<lb/>he also spake at large about the children,

<lb/>but kept his own suspicions to himself.

<lb/>They then took <sic>planispheres</sic> and <sic>astrolabes</sic>,

<lb/>and having spent a <sic>sennight</sic> on the business

<pb n="216"/>

<lb/>said: <q> How can wine be in a cup which thou

<lb/>with ease if they had been of royal race,
<lb/>but know that heaven <sic>revealeth</sic> not their secret,
<lb/>nor is this wonder of the earth.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>They told
<lb/>the Shah and court of that foul, wicked woman.
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> wailed and cried aloud for justice,
<lb/>she called upon the world-lord for redress,
<lb/>and said: <q>I was the comrade of the Shah
<lb/>when he had suffered and had lost the throne.
<lb/>My heart is tortured for my murdered babes,
<lb/>and ever and anon I swoon away.</q>

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.548"/><p>


<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>O woman! hold thy peace!
<lb/>Why dost thou utter such offensive words ?</q>
</p><p>


<lb/>He gave commandment that the troops on guard
<lb/>should search the city and the neighbouring parts,
<lb/>and bring the wicked woman to the court.

<lb/>The experienced searchers soon discovered her,
<lb/>Haled the unhappy woman through the streets,
<lb/>and carried her in shame before the Shah,
<lb/>who questioned her with kindness, held out hopes,
<lb/>and made her promises for many days,
<lb/>Howbeit she confessed not anything.

</p><p>


<lb/>The noble Shah was still dissatisfied,
<lb/>and gave command to bear her forth and use
<lb/>all means and work by spells, and in the end
<lb/>to cut her down the middle with a saw
<lb/>if she persisted, as is common justice.
<lb/>They bore her from the palace of the Shah,
<lb/>and threatened her with sword and stake and pit.
<lb/>The sorceress answered: <q>I am innocent.
<lb/>What can I say before this noble court?</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>They told the monarch of the woman’s words,

<pb n="217"/>

<lb/>and added: <q>God alone doth know the truth.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The great king bade <persName>Sudaba</persName> come to him;
<lb/>the readers of the stars re-said their say :—
<lb/><q> Both babes are clearly children of the witch,
<lb/>begotten from the loins of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Suddba said: <q>They know a different tale,
<lb/>but dare not speak for fear of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>who privily hath tied them down to silence.

<lb/>What have the readers of the stars to do

<lb/>While as for thee—thou <sic>mournest</sic> not thy babes,

<lb/>If thou <sic>believest</sic> such a foolish charge
<lb/>I leave the question to the other world.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The sun <sic>withdraweth</sic> from the river <placeName>Nile</placeName>
<lb/>less water than <persName>Sudaba</persName> shed in tears.
<lb/>The Shah was sorely troubled at her speech ;
<lb/>he joined with her in weeping bitterly,
<lb/>and then, and with a broken heart, dismissed her.
<lb/>He brooded constantly upon the matter,
<lb/>and said: <q>I will investigate it throughly,
<lb/>and find out what the bottom of it is.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He summoned all the <sic>archmages</sic> of the realm,
<lb/>and spake about <persName>Sudaba</persName>. One replied :—
<lb/><q>The monarch’s grief will not remain a secret.
<lb/>If thou wouldst clear up what hath been alleged
<lb/>on each side, throw a stone and break the pitcher,
<lb/>because, however dear his son may be,

<pb n="218"/>

<lb/>the Shah’s heart will be still disturbed by thoughts,

<lb/>hath made thee doubtful on the other side.
<lb/>Such being then the statements of the pair
<lb/>let one of them be made to pass through fire,
<lb/>because high heaven <sic>ordaineth</sic> that no harm
<lb/>shall in this way befall the innocent.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The world-lord called <persName>Sudaba</persName>, seated her
<lb/>with <persName>Siyawush</persName> to parley on the case,
<lb/>and said at last : <q> My heart and my shrewd mind

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.550"/><p>
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> answered : <q> What I said is true;

<lb/>what greater outrage can there be than mine?
<lb/>'Tis <persName>Siyawush</persName> that ought to right himself:
<lb/>he sought to ruin me and did the wrong.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The king of earth then asked his youthful son :—
<lb/><q>What seemeth good to thee as touching this?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He answered: <q>Such a charge is worse than Hell!

<lb/>The thoughts of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> ran on them both ;
<lb/>he said: <q>If either prove a profligate

<lb/>will any henceforth call me Shah? Moreover
<lb/>my son and wife are blood and brain to me;
<lb/>whom then will this perplexing business profit ?
<lb/>Still it is best to purify my heart

<lb/>How well the moralizing monarch said :—

<pb n="219"/>

<lb/><q>If thou art faint of heart play not the king !</q></q><ref target="n.219.1"/>


</p><p>

<lb/>He gave instructions to his minister
<lb/>to have a hundred caravans of camels
<lb/>brought from the plain. These went to gather firewood,
<lb/>while all the people of <placeName>Iran</placeName> looked on,

<lb/>till two huge mountains rose that might be seen

<lb/>two leagues away ; so should a key be found


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.551"/>
<lb/>to loose the bonds of bale, so much he yearned 
<lb/>to learn the truth amid this fraud and wrong.


</p><p>


<lb/>When thou hast heard the story thou wilt find
<lb/>thyself disposed to shun all womankind ;

<lb/>seek none of them except the virtuous; she
<lb/>that <sic>worketh</sic> ill will bring disgrace on thee.


</p><p>

<lb/>They piled two mounts of firewood on the plain
<lb/>while all the folk looked on. A path was left
<lb/>such that a horseman armed might hardly pass
<lb/>between the piles. This done, the glorious Shah
<lb/>bade pour black naphtha over all the wood.

<lb/>Came ten score men to light and blow the fire,
<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q>The day is turned to night.</q>
<lb/>when first they blew there was a mass of smoke,
<lb/>but presently the tongues of fire rose fast ;

<lb/>the earth became more radiant than the sky,

<lb/>the people shouted and the flames ascended.

<lb/>All that were on the plain were scorched and wept
<lb/>to see the cheery face of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>who came before his sire with golden helmet,
<lb/>and raiment all of white. His mien was tranquil,
<lb/>his face all smiles, his heart all hopefulness ;

<lb/>his black steed's hoofs sent dust up to the moon.
<lb/>The prince then sprinkled camphor o’er himself,

<lb/>and lighting from his charger did obeisance.
<lb/>The Shah was shame-faced and his words were kind.
<lb/><q> Be not discomfited,</q> said <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/><q>That fortune taketh such a turn as this.
<lb/>I am dishonoured: such a state is ruin.

<lb/>but by the power of God who giveth good
<lb/>I shall not feel the heat.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>As he drew near
<lb/>the flames he prayed the Judge that hath no needs :—
<lb/><q>Grant me a passage through this mount of fire,
<lb/>and free me from my sire’s <sic>misprision</sic>.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Thus
<lb/>he testified the anguish of his soul,
<lb/>then urged his black steed on like smoke. A wail
<lb/>ascended from the city and the waste,
<lb/>for all the people grieved at what was done.
<lb/><persName>Sudaba</persName> heard the wailing on the plain,
<lb/>went to the palace-roof, <sic>descried</sic> the blaze,
<lb/>wished ill to him, and babbled feverishly.
<lb/>The people fixed their eyes upon <persName>Kaus</persName>;
<lb/>their tongues wagged freely and their hearts were <sic>wroth</sic>.

<lb/>Meanwhile the prince so handled his black charger
<lb/>that thou hadst said: <q> His steed took to the fire.</q>
<lb/>From every side the flames closed o’er his head,
<lb/>and none could see his helmet or his horse,
<lb/>while all the plain wept tears of blood and asked :—
<lb/><q> How will he ever issue from the flames ?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The noble hero <sic>nathless</sic> reappeared,
<lb/>with rosy cheeks and smiles upon his lips.
<lb/>A roar went up as men caught sight of him:
<lb/>they cried: <q>The young Shah cometh from the fire!</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He came with horse and raiment such that thou
<lb/>hadst said: <q>He beareth jasmine in his breast.</q>

<pb n="221"/>

<lb/>had flame been water he had not been wetted,

<lb/>his garments would have holden none of it ;

<lb/>for when all-holy God doth so vouchsafe

<lb/>the breath of fire is even as the wind.

<lb/>The horsemen of the host urged on their steeds,

<lb/>while all the people on the plain threw <sic>drachms</sic>

<lb/>before him ; there was universal joy

<lb/>the guiltless <persName>Siyawush</persName> approached, his sire

<lb/>and all the warriors of the host alighted ;

<lb/>but <persName>Siyawush</persName> with cheek upon the ground

<lb/>gave thanks to God that he had been delivered

<lb/>out of that burning mount, and had confounded

<lb/>his foes' device. Then said the Shah: <q>Brave youth,

<lb/>of stainless lineage and ardent soul!

<lb/>None but a holy mother <sic>bringeth</sic> forth

<lb/>a son like thee, and such should rule the world.</q>

<lb/>Then clasped he <persName>Siyawush</persName> against his breast,

<lb/>excused his own ill conduct, and in state

<lb/>moved palace-ward. He took his seat rejoicing,

<lb/>and placed the royal crown upon his head.

<lb/>He had wine brought, the minstrels called, and granted

<lb/><q>Thou art a shameless woman! Thou hast wrought

<lb/>She said: <q>O Shah! forbear to heap up fire

<lb/>How shall I punish her ?</q>

<lb/>and said: <q>Of fire and water, earth and air,
<lb/>in sooth God did not make <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>but otherwise, who swore so great an oath,
<lb/>and promised fairly with his tongue, yet now

<lb/>and waste no little of its fields and fells.</q>

<lb/><q> What is an army for,</q> the <sic>archmages</sic> said,

<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>I see none here that hath

<lb/>The Maker's purpose was that <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>thou who wast <sic>fosterer</sic> of <persName>Siyawush</persName> !
<lb/>When mines of jewels are bound down with iron
<lb/>they open when thou <sic>bindest</sic> up thy loins.
<lb/>Now <persName>Siyawush</persName> hath come with belted waist
<lb/>and, like a savage lion, talked with me:
<lb/>his object is to fight <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Go with him, keep him underneath thine eye ;

<lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q>I am thy slave;

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> led forth the Host</head>
<p>


<lb/>A clang of trump and <sic>kettledrum</sic> arose
<lb/>as <persName>Tus</persName>, the illustrious captain of the host,
<lb/>arrived, and troops assembled at the court.
<lb/>The Shah unlocked his treasures and dinars,
<lb/>he sent the keys of all his magazines
<lb/>of arms, of armour, and of stuffs uncut
<lb/>to <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and said: <q>My house and goods
<lb/>are thine, equip thee as thou <sic>thinkest</sic>: best.</q>
<lb/>Then from his famous cavaliers <persName>Kaus</persName>

<lb/>chose him twelve thousand gallant warriors,
<lb/>while from the neighbourhood of <placeName>Kuch</placeName> and <placeName>Pars</placeName>,
<lb/><placeName>Baluch</placeName> and from the desert of <placeName>Saruch</placeName>
<lb/>and warriors of <placeName>Gilan</placeName>, he chose for war
<lb/>twelve thousand infantry and buckler-men.
<lb/>All that were hero-born throughout <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>the gallant, wise, and noble, all who had
<lb/>the stature and the years of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>with courage, vigilance, and self-command,
<lb/>some also of the mighty men of name—
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> and <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>,—
<lb/>and five <sic>archmages</sic> of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>

<pb n="227"/>

<lb/>to bear the flag of <persName>Kawa</persName> to the field,
<lb/>these he commanded to go forth together
<lb/>beyond the borders to the desert-plain :
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>There is no room still left
<lb/>on earth for horses' hoofs to stand upon.</q>
<lb/>The flag of <persName>Kawa</persName> lifted to the sky
<lb/>shone like a moon amid the troops. <persName>Kaus</persName>
<lb/>went with them past the frontier, while the dust
<lb/>raised by the host rolled swiftly. He reviewed
<lb/>the warriors with their bridal bravery
<lb/>of elephants of war and <sic>tymbal</sic>-din ;
<lb/>the noble monarch blessed the host and said :—
<lb/><q>O men of name whose steps are glorious!
<lb/>Good fortune be your sole companion :
<lb/>may darkness fall upon your <sic>foemen</sic>’s sight.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.559"/>
<lb/>Be it yours to go with health and favouring stars, 
<lb/>and come back triumphing and glad.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The prince
<lb/>then set the drums upon the elephants,
<lb/>bestrode his steed, and bade his warriors mount,
<lb/>while Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> with tearful eyes went forward
<lb/>one day’s march with him. Then the twain embraced,
<lb/>both of them weeping like a cloud in spring.
<lb/>They poured down tears of blood and cried aloud
<lb/>in their distress, for as they went along
<lb/>their hearts gave witness to them that thenceforth
<lb/>they should not look upon each other more.

<lb/>Thus fortune ever <sic>changeth</sic>, and our gain
<lb/>therefrom is sometimes balm and sometimes bane.


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> turned toward his throne, and <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>marched with his warlike army from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>toward <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName> to visit <persName>Zal</persName>

<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName> of the elephantine form ;

<lb/>and there with <persName>Zal</persName>, the favourite of fortune,
<lb/>he spent some time with wine and <sic>minstrelsy</sic>.
<lb/>At whiles he drank with <persName>Rustam</persName> and at whiles

<pb n="228"/>


<lb/>Consorted with <persName>Zawara</persName>, sat rejoicing
<lb/>upon the throne of <persName>Zal</persName> or drew the reed-beds.
<lb/>A month so passed. Then leaving <persName>Zal</persName> he marched
<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName> as his paladin, and warriors
<lb/>drawn from <placeName>Zabul</placeName>, <placeName>Kabul</placeName>, and <placeName>Hind</placeName>. Moreover
<lb/>he summoned famous chiefs from every quarter
<lb/>until he reached the desert of <placeName>Harat</placeName>.
<lb/>These furnished footmen not <sic>afew</sic>. He made
<lb/>their leader <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>,
<lb/>and marched toward <placeName>Talikan</placeName> and the <placeName>Marvrud</placeName>.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The heaven <sic>greeteth</sic> him.</q>
<lb/>Anon he came to <placeName>Balkh</placeName>, and injured none
<lb/>Een by a bitter word.<ref target="n.228.1"/>

</p><p>

<lb/>On the other side
<lb/><persName>Bahman</persName> and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> led on their power
<lb/>as '<sic>twere</sic> a tempest. <persName>Sipahram</persName> commanded
<lb/>the rear, <persName>Bahman</persName> the van. To them there came
<lb/>news of the youthful chief: <q> A mighty host—
<lb/>famed warriors all—hath issued from <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.560"/>

</p><p>
<lb/>The captain of the host despatched by night
<lb/>a messenger to tell <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> :—
<lb/><q>A great and gallant host hath come. Its head
<lb/>is <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and there are other princes.
<lb/>The <sic>marshaller</sic> is elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>whose hands bear one a sword and one a shroud.
<lb/>If now the monarch so <sic>commandeth</sic> me,
<lb/>I will array the host and offer battle ;
<lb/>but do thou gather troops and tarry not,
<lb/>because the wind is blowing up the flames.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The bearer of the tidings and his guide,
<lb/>as they were bidden, urged their <sic>dromedaries</sic>
<lb/>like fire, while <persName>Siyawush</persName> made no delay
<lb/>and marched his army on like wind to <placeName>Balkh</placeName>.
<lb/>The Iranian host drew near; it was not well
<lb/>to wait an answer from <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<pb n="229"/>

<lb/>and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> the warrior looking round

<lb/>perceived no course except to offer battle.

<lb/>So when the army of <placeName>Iran</placeName> came up

<lb/>the fight began about the gates of <placeName>Balkh</placeName>,

<lb/>where in three days were two great battles fought.
<lb/>The fourth day <persName>Siyawush</persName>, the army’s Lustre,

<lb/>sent infantry against each several gate ;

<lb/>the mighty army entered into <placeName>Balkh</placeName>,

<lb/>while <persName>Sipahram</persName> fled o’er the stream, and then
<lb/>toward <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> with all his men.

<lb/>The prince and army having entered <placeName>Balkh</placeName>,

<lb/>he wrote on silk with <sic>spicery</sic> and musk

<lb/>in fitting style a letter to the Shah,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.561"/>
<lb/>beginning with the praise of the Almighty :— 

<lb/><q>From Him are triumph and success Who is

<lb/>the Lord of sun and circling moon, and giveth

<lb/>crown, throne, and <sic>casque</sic> their lustre, whom He will

<lb/>exalting or <sic>dejecting</sic>, ordering

<lb/>to acquiesce. From that just Judge who made

<lb/>the world, who made the seen and the unseen,

<lb/>may every blessing be upon the Shah,

<lb/>all good attend him to the last. I came

<lb/>to <placeName>Balkh</placeName> with joy and triumph through the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>

<lb/>of him who hath the crown and throne—the <sic>worldlord</sic>.

<lb/>We fought three days, the fourth God favoured us;

<lb/><persName>Bahman</persName> and <persName>Sipahram</persName> fled toward <placeName>Tirmid</placeName>,

<lb/>like arrows from the bow. I am encamped

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> is with his host at <placeName>Sughd</placeName>,

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
<head>The Answer of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> to the Letter of <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>The letter reached the Shah. It raised his crown
<lb/>and throne to <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>, and he prayed to God
<lb/>that this young Tree might come to bearing fruit ;
<lb/>then wrote with joy this letter of reply,

<lb/>like shining spring or <sic>jocund</sic> Paradise -—

<lb/><q> Now through the Maker of the sun and moon—
<lb/>the World-lord who <sic>bestoweth</sic> crown and throne—
<lb/>Mayst thou for ever have a joyful heart,

<lb/>one painless and untroubled, and therewith

<lb/>the cap of power and throne of majesty.

<lb/>Thou <sic>leddest</sic> forth an army to the war

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.562"/>

<lb/>and though thy lip still <sic>savoureth</sic> of milk

<lb/>the <sic>whippings</sic> of thy bow burst in the fight !
<lb/>May thy bright heart attain its every wish,

<lb/>and may thy person ever keep its prowess!

<lb/>Since thou hast won a victory repose

<lb/>is needed for a season, but disband not,

<lb/>albeit he <sic>possesseth</sic> crown and power,

<lb/>Affronting with his head the sun and moon.

<lb/>Be not in any haste to challenge fight ;

<lb/>and, if he cross <placeName>Jihun</placeName>, will trail his skirt

<pb n="231"/>

<lb/>in blood.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He sealed this, called the messenger,

<lb/>and gave it with injunctions to return.
<lb/>The messenger sped over hill and dale,
<lb/>and came to <persName>Siyawush</persName> who, when he saw
<lb/>the letter, was rejoiced and kissed the ground,
<lb/>put off the bondage of anxiety,
<lb/>and carefully observed the Shah’s commands,
<lb/>not swerving from his duty as a liege.

</p><p>

<lb/>Thereafter <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, the lion-man,
<lb/>approached the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName>, like dust,
<lb/>and told this grievous and unwelcome tale :—
<lb/><q>The chieftain <persName>Siyawush</persName> arrived at <placeName>Balkh</placeName>
<lb/>with <persName>Rustam</persName> as his <sic>marshaller</sic>, with troops
<lb/>past count, and many men of name and leading.
<lb/>They had full fifty men to one of ours—
<lb/>proud warriors, <sic>wielders</sic> of the buffalo-mace.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.563"/>
<lb/>Their footmen were like fire, and had shield, quiver, 
<lb/>and shaft. The eagle soared not o’er their dust.
<lb/>They had no drowsy heads, and this we proved
<lb/>three days and nights, and then our troops lost heart ;
<lb/>but with the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> he who needed rest
<lb/>retired forthwith from where the brave were fighting,

<lb/>and after having <sic>slumbered</sic> rose refreshed
<lb/>to make him ready for the fight again.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> raged like a fire. He quitted
<lb/>the stead of his tranquillity and slumber ;
<lb/>he glared at <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, and thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will sunder him in twain !</q>
<lb/>Then in a fury that he could not master
<lb/>he cried aloud and <sic>drave</sic> his brother out.
<lb/>Anon he bade a thousand of the lords
<lb/>be summoned and a festival prepared.
<lb/>They put up hangings over all the waste,

<pb n="232"/>

<lb/>and decked all <placeName>Sughd</placeName> with ornaments of <placeName>Chin</placeName>:
<lb/>the day thus passed away with happiness.
<lb/>Now when the Eye that <sic>lighteth</sic> earth had gone

<lb/>As night advanced <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> cried out,
<lb/>and shook upon his bed like one with ague,
<lb/>while slaves sprang up and sounded the alarm.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.564"/>

<lb/>Whenas the tidings came to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> :—
<lb/><q> The glory of the kingdom is obscured,</q>
<lb/>He hasted to the presence of the king,
<lb/>beheld him lying on the dusty floor,
<lb/>embraced him, questioned him, and said: <q>Come tell
<lb/>thy brother all.</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q> Ask me not,

<lb/>speak not to me till I regain some wits,
<lb/>but take and clasp me to thy breast awhile.</q>

<lb/>Anon on coming to himself he saw
<lb/>a world of lamentation and of hubbub.
<lb/>They lighted candles and he took his seat,
<lb/>still shaking like a bough, upon the throne,
<lb/>then said to him aspiring <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> :-—
<lb/><q> Unlock thy lips and tell us this strange thing.</q>

</p><p>


<lb/>He answered: <q> None will see a vision such
<lb/>as I have looked upon this <sic>darksome</sic> night:
<lb/>I have not heard of such from young or old.
<lb/>I saw in sleep a desert full of serpents,
<lb/>the sky all eagles and the ground all dust,
<lb/>and so parched up that thou hadst said: <q>The heaven
<lb/>hath not looked on it since the world began.</q>
<lb/>upon one side my tent-enclosure stood,

<pb n="233"/>

<lb/>and round it was a host of warriors.
<lb/>A dust-storm rose and laid my standard low,
<lb/>blood surged around, the tents and tent-enclosure
<lb/>were overthrown, while of my countless troops
<lb/>the heads were lopped, the bodies spurned aside.
<lb/>Came like a blast an army from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>what spears they bore and what artillery !
<lb/>There was a head impaled on every spear,
<lb/>another was in every horseman’s lap.
<lb/>A hundred thousand of them sable-clad,
<lb/>and wielding spears, came charging at my throne.
<lb/>They <sic>drave</sic> me from the place where I was sitting,
<lb/>made my hands fast, and hurried me along.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.565"/>
<lb/>I looked around me well and many a time, 
<lb/>but none of mine own kin was present there.
<lb/>A haughty and illustrious paladin
<lb/>bore me before <persName>Kaus</persName> the Shah in haste.
<lb/>A throne was there; its summit reached the moon,
<lb/>and on the throne was seated Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>the hero, while a youth with <sic>moonlike</sic> cheeks
<lb/>was seated near to him—a youth whose years
<lb/>had not yet reached fourteen, who, when he saw

<lb/>came rushing at me like a thundering cloud,
<lb/>and <sic>clave</sic> me to the middle with his sword.

<lb/>From far and near the <sic>learnéd</sic> in this lore

<lb/>The king gave audience, placed them in due rank
<lb/>before him, spake of matters great and small
<lb/>with each, and then addressed the company,
<lb/>the priests, the sages, and astrologers:— _

<lb/><q> Tell no one openly or as a secret

<lb/>this dream of mine, or what I now shall say.

<lb/>I will not leave the head upon the trunk

<lb/>that they might feel assured, then told his dream.

<lb/>asked in alarm protection at his hands,

<lb/>and said: <q>We <sic>cannot</sic> read this dream aright
<lb/>unless the king with his own mouth shall promise
<lb/>that he will do us justice when we tell

</p><p>

<lb/>He promised not to harm
<lb/>or to impute the ill to them. Their spokesman,

<lb/>an army cometh mighty and alert,
<lb/>the chiefs are brave, the leader is a prince
<lb/>with many world-experienced counsellors,

<lb/><q> None will seek vengeance if I fight him not;

<head>How <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> took Counsel with the Nobles</head>
<p>

<lb/>Now when the sky had half revolved, and when
<lb/>the shining sun displayed its face once more,
<lb/>the mighty men <sic>betook</sic> themselves to court
<lb/>with covered heads to offer their respects.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> convoked the experienced sages,

<lb/>and thus addressed them: <q>It hath been my lot
<lb/>to see no desert but that made by war,

<pb n="236"/>

<lb/>and many great ones of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>

<lb/>have perished by my hand upon the field.
<lb/>What cities have been turned to hospitals!
<lb/>What beds of roses into brakes of brambles!

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.568"/>

<lb/>What uplands have I made my battle-grounds!
<lb/>My troops have left their traces everywhere.

<lb/>It is because unjust kings rule the world

<lb/>that good of every kind is vanishing.

<lb/>No <sic>onagers</sic> are breeding in their season

<lb/>upon the plains; hawks rear a sightless brood ;
<lb/>milk <sic>faileth</sic> in the udders of the <sic>gaine</sic>;

<lb/>the water in the springs is turned to pitch,
<lb/>and they are drying up throughout the world;
<lb/>musk-bags no longer yield the scent of musk ;
<lb/>all that is right is frayed by villainy,

<lb/>and population <sic>faileth</sic> everywhere.

<lb/>My heart is satiate of strife and outrage:

<lb/>fain would I walk the path of godliness.

<lb/>Then be we just and wise again; let pleasures
<lb/>stand in the place of misery and travail.

<lb/>For our part let us give the world some respite ;
<lb/>death should not come upon men unawares.
<lb/>The more part of the world is at my feet:

<lb/>my court is in <placeName>Iran</placeName> and in <placeName>Turan</placeName>,

<lb/>for see how many of the mighty men

<lb/>bring heavy tribute to me year by year!

<lb/>Now if it be your minds I will dispatch

<lb/>an embassy to <persName>Rustam</persName>, and forthwith

<lb/>knock at the door of peace with <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and send him every kind of precious gift.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The chieftains gave their answers one by one:
<lb/>all were for peace and amity. They said :-—
<lb/><q>Thou art the monarch and we are thy slaves,
<lb/>with hearts devoted to perform thy <sic>hest</sic>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The councillors dispersed with minds intent
<lb/>on justice, with no thought of strife and turmoil.

<pb n="237"/>

<lb/>then said <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>:—

<lb/><q> Make all thy preparations for the journey
<lb/>with speed, and tarry not upon the road.

<lb/>Choose out two hundred horsemen from the host,
<lb/>and carry precious things to <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>from all the divers treasures in our hoard.

<lb/>Take <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steeds with golden furniture

<lb/>and Indian <sic>scimitars</sic> with golden sheaths,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.569"/>
<lb/>a crown of jewels that a king might wear, 
<lb/>a hundred camel-loads of carpeting, ,
<lb/>and take two hundred slaves both boys and girls.
<lb/>Say thus to him: <q>I have no quarrel with thee.</q>
<lb/>hold converse with him and <sic>bespeak</sic> him thus :—
<lb/><q>I do not set my face against <placeName>Iran</placeName>.

<lb/>All from the bank of the <placeName>Jihun</placeName> to <placeName>Chin</placeName>

<lb/>is mine, my home is <placeName>Sughd</placeName>—a realm distinct.

<lb/>In truth it is through <persName>Tur</persName> and valiant <persName>Salm</persName>
<lb/>that all the world is thus turned upside down,
<lb/>and since the innocent <persName>Iraj</persName> was slain

<lb/>our warriors' brains have lost their wits. <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>is not divided from <placeName>Turan</placeName>, but wars

<lb/>and feuds prevented friendship. Now I trust
<lb/>that God will give good days and joyful news.
<lb/>He raised thee from the country of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>and giveth thee the friendship of the brave.

<lb/>Let thy fair fortune dower the world with peace,
<lb/>let war and every evil disappear.

<lb/>Now <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> hath come to add his wits

<lb/>to thine, and as the valiant <persName>Faridun</persName>

<lb/>Erst shared the world among his gallant sons,

<lb/>so be it now. Let us adopt his <sic>rede</sic>,

<lb/>and turn our feet from battle and revenge.

<lb/>Thou art a Shah thyself; speak to the Shah:
<lb/>perchance his warlike purpose may relax.</q>

<lb/>speak also unto elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>

<lb/>in fair words, plying him with arguments,

<pb n="238"/>

<lb/>and, that the business may be carried through,
<lb/>give gifts to him like those to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>except a golden throne; no Shah is he;
<lb/>thrones are above a paladin’s degree.</q>

<lb/>So <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> with those rich gifts, which made

<lb/>earth’s face look gay, sped on to the <placeName>Jihun</placeName>,
<lb/>and there chose one to go to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>and say thus: <q> <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> hath come in state,
<lb/>hath crossed the river in a single day

<lb/>by boat, and hastened on the road to <placeName>Balkh</placeName>.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The envoy came and gave the prince the message.
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> called elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>discussed the matter from all points of view,

<lb/>and ordered <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> to be admitted,

<lb/>rose when he came and welcomed him with smiles,
<lb/>while <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> afar off kissed the ground,

<lb/>with downcast looks and terror in his heart.

<lb/>The prince, first seating him below the throne,
<lb/>asked eagerly about <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<lb/>and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> beholding as he sat

<lb/>the prince on his new throne, his head, and crown,
<lb/>spake unto <persName>Rustam</persName> thus: <q> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<lb/>as soon as he had tidings of thy coming,
<lb/>dispatched at once a keepsake to the prince,

<lb/>and I have brought it with me on my way.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He bade his followers to bring the gifts

<lb/>and pass along in front of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>All from the city’s gateway to the court
<lb/>were horses, <sic>drachms</sic>, boy-slaves, and troops. None knew
<lb/>the tale of <sic>diadems</sic>, dinars, high thrones,
<lb/>of slave-boys all with caps and girdles on,
<lb/>and women-slaves with bracelets and gold torques.

<pb n="239"/>

<lb/>the prince was gratified and smiling gazed

<lb/>upon them as he heard the embassage ;

<lb/>but matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q>Come, let us feast

<lb/>a week and then proceed to the reply,

<lb/>for this request must be considered well,

<lb/>and there are many to advise withal.</q>


</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.571"/><p>
<lb/>Far-sighted <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> on hearing this 

<lb/>did lowly reverence and kissed the ground.

<lb/>They draped a mansion with brocade for him

<lb/>and requisitioned cooks; but <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName> of the elephantine form

<lb/>withdrew and sat to canvass all the case,

<lb/>for <persName>Rustam</persName> had suspicions through the haste

<lb/>of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>; they hurried out their scouts

<lb/>and took precautions. Then said <persName>Siyawush</persName> :—

<lb/><q>Come, let us bring this mystery to light:

<lb/>what motives can they have for seeking peace ?

<lb/>Look for an antidote for this their bane—

<lb/>think of the names of five score noble men,

<lb/>close blood-relations of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;

<lb/>these let him send to us as hostages

<lb/>to clear the dark suspicions in our minds.

<lb/>Seest not how fear of us <sic>oppresseth</sic> him,

<lb/>and how he <sic>laboreth</sic> beneath the blanket ?<ref target="n.239.1"/>

<lb/>this done we must'send one to tell the Shah;

<lb/>may be he will abandon thoughts of war.</q>


</p><p>
<lb/><q>This is the proper method,</q> <persName>Rustam</persName> said,

<lb/><q>In this way only will a pact be made.</q>

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> made a Treaty with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>At daybreak <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> appeared at court,
<lb/>with covered head and girdle round his loins,
<lb/>and having been admitted kissed the ground,

<note xml:id="n.239.1">i.e. attempts to hide what is obvious,</note>

<pb n="240"/>

<lb/>and did obeisance unto <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>who said : <q> How was it with thee <sic>yesternight</sic>

<lb/>amid this great encampment and such din?</q>

<lb/>And added: <q> As for this affair of thine,

<lb/>I have considered fully thy proposal,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.572"/>
<lb/>and in our object we are both agreed—

<lb/>we both would wash out vengeance from our hearts.

<lb/>Send then this answer to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> :—

<lb/><q>Cease now to muse revenge. He that hath seen

<lb/>the sequel of wrongdoing should recoil

<lb/>from acting wrongfully. The heart adorned

<lb/>with wisdom is as '<sic>twere</sic> a hoard of gold

<lb/>and goods. If bane be not beneath these sweets,

<lb/>and thou <sic>intendest</sic> neither wrong nor hurt,

<lb/>then, since thou <sic>wishest</sic> for a stable league,

<lb/>dispatch to me by way of hostages,

<lb/>and as security for thy good faith,

<lb/>a hundred members of thy family,

<lb/>all warriors known to <persName>Rustam</persName>, who will give

<lb/>the list of names to thee; and furthermore

<lb/>whatever cities thou hast in <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>surrender, keep within <placeName>Turan</placeName> thyself,

<lb/>repose from wars and those that seek revenge,

<lb/>and let right only be between us two:

<lb/>it is not well to favour savage <sic>pards</sic>.

<lb/>I will dispatch a letter to the Shah: 

<lb/>he may perchance recall the host in peace.</q></q>


</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> dispatched a cavalier

<lb/>swift as a blast, and said: <q>Court not repose,

<lb/>but hasten to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> and say

<lb/>from me: <q>I have proceeded diligently,

<lb/>and have obtained the whole of what I sought ;

<lb/>but <persName>Siyawush</persName> <sic>demandeth</sic> hostages

<lb/>if thou wilt have him turn away from war.</q></q> 


</p><p>
<lb/>The messenger arrived and told the king

<lb/>what <persName>Siyawush</persName> and noble <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>

<pb n="241"/>

<lb/>had said, and when the king had heard the words
<lb/>he was exceeding troubled and in doubt.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.573"/>
<lb/>He thus bethought him: <q>If a hundred men 
<lb/>of mine own kin are taken from the host,
<lb/>we shall be worsted on the battlefield
<lb/>for want of those devoted to my cause;
<lb/>while if I say : <q>Demand no hostages,</q>
<lb/>mine overtures will seem to him dishonest.
<lb/>I e’en must send the hostages if he
<lb/>Insisteth thereupon. May be these ills
<lb/>will pass away from me: in any case
<lb/>I shall be better wise than otherwise.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch out of those whom <persName>Rustam</persName> named
<lb/>selected some five score of his own kin,
<lb/>and sent them unto <persName>Siyawush</persName>, bestowing
<lb/>upon them many gifts and benefits.
<lb/>He then bade sound the drums and <sic>clarions</sic>,
<lb/>he struck the royal tent, evacuated
<lb/>bukhara, <placeName>Sughd</placeName>, and <placeName>Samarkand</placeName>, and <placeName>Chach</placeName>,
<lb/>the land and ivory throne of <placeName>Sipanjab</placeName>,
<lb/>and led his troops upon the way to <placeName>Gang</placeName>
<lb/>without excuses, pretexts, or delays.
<lb/>As soon as <persName>Rustam</persName> heard of this retreat
<lb/>his mind was eased, he sought the prince and said :—
<lb/><q> All now is well, let <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> depart.</q>



</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> gave orders to prepare
<lb/>a present—armour, crown, and belt, a steed
<lb/>of <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> blood with golden furniture,
<lb/>besides an Indian <sic>falchion</sic> in a scabbard
<lb/>of gold. When <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> beheld them, thou

<lb/>He went his way with blessings on his tongue:

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> sent <persName>Rustam</persName> to <persName>Kaus</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> sat on the ivory throne,
<lb/>and hung the crown above it. He considered
<lb/>whom he should send, what man of courteous speech
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.574"/>
<lb/>whose words had scent and hue, a cavalier
<lb/>of valour and a favourite with the Shah.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q>On such a topic who

<lb/>his petulance <sic>increaseth</sic>: what if I
<lb/>approach him and make this dark matter clear ?
<lb/>I will rend earth at thy behest. I see
<lb/>in going naught but good.</q>


</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>rejoiced, and spake no more of messengers,
<lb/>but sat with <persName>Rustam</persName> and discussed the matter,
<lb/>then called a scribe and had a letter written
<lb/>on silk. There first he praised the Judge from whom
<lb/>he had his fortune, strength, and excellence—
<lb/><q>The Lord of understanding, time, and power,
<lb/>the Nourisher of wisdom in the soul.
<lb/>None can transgress His ordinance. The man
<lb/>who <sic>disobeyeth</sic> Him can look for naught
<lb/>but loss, for He is Author both of wealth
<lb/>and right. From Him who fashioned sun and moon,
<lb/>who <sic>illustrateth</sic> fortune, throne, and crown,
<lb/>be blessings showered upon our sovereign——
<lb/>the lord of earth, the chosen of the great,
<lb/>whose purview <sic>reacheth</sic> all things good and ill:
<lb/>may his tall form be wisdom’s pedestal.
<lb/>I came to <placeName>Balkh</placeName> this <sic>jocund</sic> spring, rejoicing ;
<lb/>but when <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had news of me
<lb/>the sparkling liquor darkened in his cup:
<lb/>he saw that he was in a strait; the world

<pb n="243"/>

<lb/>was black and fortune fallen. His brother came

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.575"/>
<lb/>with gifts and many fair slaves richly <sic>dight</sic> 
<lb/>to me to seek protection from the Shah,
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will yield the crown and throne
<lb/>of kings, content with his own realm; observe
<lb/>his station; never tread <placeName>Iran</placeName>’s dark soil;
<lb/>but wash all strife and vengeance from his heart,
<lb/>and send as hostages a hundred kinsmen.
<lb/>Great <persName>Rustam</persName> now hath come with this request—
<lb/>that as the Shah’s face is a pledge of love,
<lb/>he will show love toward <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> reached the royal court
<lb/>in fitting state with flag and retinue,
<lb/>while loyal <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> with all dispatch
<lb/>went to the presence of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>gave him a full account of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>He hath no match among the kings
<lb/>for beauty, mien, address, and common sense,
<lb/>good feeling, modesty, and energy :
<lb/>brave, affable, a gallant cavalier—
<lb/><q> His breast is wisdom’s home,</q> thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The monarch smiled and said : <q>To scheme, my friend !
<lb/>Is better than to fight. The dream alarmed me,
<lb/>foreboding, as I saw, my fall from power;
<lb/>so in distress I turned to artifice
<lb/>in order to relieve me of my woe:
<lb/>I schemed to work with coin and treasury ;
<lb/>thus everything hath turned out well for me.</q>

<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> <sic>guve</sic> the Message to <persName>Kaus</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Now on his side like flying dust came <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>the Lion-man, with folded arms before

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.576"/>
<lb/>the Shah, who met, embraced him, and inquired 

<pb n="244"/>

<lb/>about the prince, the progress of events,

<lb/>the warriors, the battles, and the host,

<lb/>and wherefore he had come. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> gave
<lb/>the letter, first extolling <persName>Siyawush</persName> ;

<lb/>a ready scribe then read it, and the face

<lb/>of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> was pitch-like: <q>I allow,</q>

<lb/>He said, <q>that he is young and all <sic>unversed</sic>

<lb/>in ill—no wonder—but thou art a man
<lb/>experienced, and hast witnessed good and bad

<lb/>of all kinds: thou hast not thy peer on earth,
<lb/>and Lions grow adept by fighting thee.

<lb/>Hast thou not seen <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>’s ill deeds—

<lb/>how he hath robbed us of food, rest, and sleep ?
<lb/>I should have gone myself but I forbore,
<lb/>although it was my wish to fight with him.

<lb/>I went not, for men said: <q>Go not thyself:
<lb/>remain here that the young prince may command.</q>
<lb/>when God had meant that vengeance should be taken,
<lb/>and ills had asked a recompense of ill,

<lb/>ye sought to gain a heritage thereby,

<lb/>and that it was which occupied your hearts.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> hath led your wits astray

<lb/>by riches plundered from the innocent.

<lb/>A hundred hapless, misbegotten <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>,

<lb/>who do not even know their fathers' names !

<lb/>He will think little of such hostages:

<lb/>they are to him as water in a stream.

<lb/>If ye have dealt unwisely I am not

<lb/>sick of the toils of war; I shall dispatch

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.577"/>

<lb/>a man endowed with wisdom and resource,

<lb/>to bid the young prince: <q>Put those <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' feet
<lb/>in fetters; burn the valuable things,

<lb/>retain not one, send me the men in bonds,

<lb/>and I will take their heads off. Lead thy host
<lb/>intent on fight up to the <sic>foemen</sic>’s gate,

<lb/>at once relax all discipline, and loose

<pb n="245"/>

<lb/>thy troops like wolves among the sheep; while thou

<lb/><sic>revengest</sic>, and thy soldiers sack and burn,

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will come to fight with thee,

<lb/>for ease and peace will yield him no delight.</q></q>


</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q>O Shah! be not so moved

<lb/>because of this. First hear what I shall say;

<lb/>and then—the world is under thy command.

<lb/>Thou <sic>saidst</sic>: <q>In fighting with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>cross not the river hastily, but wait

<lb/>till he <sic>attacketh</sic>, for he will not linger,</q>

<lb/>accordingly we waited his advance,

<lb/>but from the first he <sic>oped</sic> the door of peace;

<lb/>it would be vile to haste to fight with one

<lb/>intent on peace and mirth; and thy well-wishers

<lb/>would never wish the Shah to break a compact.

<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> obtained his victories

<lb/>he charged like some brave crocodile. What wouldst thou

<lb/>but signet, crown, and throne, the Iranian treasure,

<lb/>and safety? These thou hast; shun wanton strife;

<lb/>wash not a clear heart in a turbid stream.

<lb/>Suppose that when <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> consented

<lb/>he only <sic>purposed</sic> to break covenant:


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.578"/>
<lb/>we on our side are ready for the fight 

<lb/>with <sic>scimitars</sic> and lions' claws. Then thou

<lb/>and noble <persName>Siyawush</persName> upon the throne

<lb/>of gold shall laugh with gladness in <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>while I will lead a small force from <placeName>Zabul</placeName>,

<lb/>and leave <placeName>Turan</placeName> no throne or royal seat,

<lb/>but with the mace <sic>wherewith</sic> I fight will make

<lb/>the sunlight gloomy to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;

<lb/>for he and I have often fought, and he

<lb/>will scarcely care to try another bout.

<lb/>Require not then thy son to break the treaty,

<lb/>enjoin not what <sic>amounteth</sic> to a crime.

<lb/>Why should I hide the purport of my words?


<pb n="246"/>

<lb/>thy son will never break his promises,

<lb/>and this deed that the Shah is contemplating
<lb/>will horrify that most illustrious prince.

<lb/>Dim not his fortunes or it <sic>cannot</sic> be

<lb/><q>So then the truth is out at last! 'Twas thou

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> then warned a courier, called a scribe,

<lb/>and set him by the throne to write a letter

<lb/>of wrath and strife, as '<sic>twere</sic> a poplar shaft.

<lb/>He first gave praises to Almighty God—

<lb/><q> The Lord of peace and war, the Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs>,

<lb/>of <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>, and the moon, of good and ill,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.580"/>
<lb/>of <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and throne. The turning heavens obey 
<lb/>his <sic>hest</sic>, and everywhere His love <sic>extendeth</sic>.
<lb/>May health and fortune be for ever thine,

<lb/>o youth! together with the throne and crown.
<lb/>Although thou hast forgotten mine instructions,
<lb/>and foolishly neglected to attack

<lb/>the foe, yet thou hast heard how he entreated
<lb/><placeName>Iran</placeName> when he prevailed; side not with him

<lb/>in wantonness ; frown not upon this court ;

<lb/>let not thy head be snared through youth as thou
<lb/>wouldst 'scape destruction from the turning sky.
<lb/>Send me those hostages bound hand and foot,

<lb/>it is no wonder if <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>hath duped thee, if I judge him by his conduct
<lb/>toward myself; oft through his <sic>glozing</sic> words
<lb/>have I turned back from fight. Now I said naught
<lb/>of peace, and thou hast disobeyed for dalliance
<lb/>with pretty slaves; while as for <persName>Rustam</persName>, he

<lb/>ne’er hath enough of precious gear and treasure.
<lb/>Thou hadst no thought of war: thine only thought
<lb/>was to succeed to the imperial crown.

<lb/>Seek with thy sword the gate of full contentment,
<lb/>for provinces are glories to a king.

<lb/>As soon as <persName>Tus</persName> the general <sic>reacheth</sic> thee

<lb/>he will dispose all matters great and small.

<lb/>Set all the hostages without delay

<pb n="248"/>

<lb/>in heavy chains upon the backs of asses.
<lb/>It is high heaven’s purpose that thy life
<lb/>should perish by this peace. Then will <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>hear of the evil and our prosperous times
<lb/>be troubled. Go, prepare thee for revenge

<lb/>They sealed the letter, and the messenger
<lb/>received it and departed. <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>on hearing words so unacceptable,
<lb/>called in the messenger and questioned him
<lb/>till all was clear. The man detailed the words
<lb/>used by the Shah to <persName>Rustam</persName>, and described
<lb/>how <persName>Rustam</persName> raged against the Shah and <persName>Tus</persName>.
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> was much displeased with <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<lb/>If I shall now dispatch them to the Shah,

<lb/>he will not ask or think about their case,

<lb/>How shall I justify myself to God?

<lb/>without a cause I shall incur God’s wrath,

<lb/>was threatening us with five score thousand sabres.
<lb/>We sped as '<sic>twere</sic> a blast to seek the fray,

<lb/>but when they left the province, sending gifts

<lb/>and hostages, the <sic>archimages</sic> held

<lb/>that we should quit the field. Now if the Shah

<lb/>is merely fighting for aggrandisement

<lb/>he may have war and territory too,

<lb/>but why such wanton bloodshed, such revenge
<lb/>stirred up in others' hearts? The brainless head
<lb/>will ne'er know good from bad. <persName>Kubad</persName> came, died,
<lb/>and left the world; from that time all was lost.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.583"/>
<lb/>My deeds please not <persName>Kaus</persName>, who fain would harm me,
<lb/>requiring me to fight without a cause.





<pb n="250"/>

<lb/>I fear that I shall perish through mine oath,
<lb/>but still we must not turn from God, or fear
<lb/>to follow our forefathers' steps. The Shah
<lb/>would rob me of both worlds, and yield me up
<lb/>to <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>! If we should fight again
<lb/>who can foretell the fortune of the day ?
<lb/>Would I had died, or never had been born,
<lb/>since I am fated to endure such bale
<lb/>and taste of every poison in the world ;
<lb/>and yet the tree hath not attained full growth
<lb/>whose fruit is venom and the leafage loss!
<lb/>Such are the treaty and oaths sworn by God
<lb/>that, if I swerve from what is right, disaster
<lb/>will come on every side; I shall be blamed
<lb/>deservedly. The world hath heard that I
<lb/>have treated with the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>Will God approve or fortune profit me
<lb/>if I desert the Faith and fight again—
<lb/>a fall from heaven to earth? I will go look
<lb/>for some retreat to hide me from the Shah.
<lb/>Meanwhile the ordering of this bright age
<lb/>is in His hands Who is the Judge of all.
<lb/>Do thou, famed <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>!
<lb/>Prepare for toil; haste to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;
<lb/>give not thy head to sleep. The hostages,
<lb/>and all the precious things—dinars, crowns, thrones—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.584"/>
<lb/>convey to him and tell him what hath chanced.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He charged <persName>Bahram</persName> son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q>To thee,
<lb/>famed man! have I resigned the host and march,
<lb/>drums, camp, and elephants. Remain till <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>the general shall arrive, then give to him
<lb/>the treasures and the troops in perfect order,
<lb/>accounting unto him for everything.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> was sorely troubled when he heard,
<lb/>while <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName> wept blood,
<lb/>and cursed the country of <placeName>Hamavaran</placeName>,

<pb n="251"/>

<lb/>the two sat there together full of grief,
<lb/>distracted by the words of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> said: <q>Nay, not so: thou canst not live
<lb/>without thy sire. Write to the Shah and ask
<lb/>to have the elephantine hero back ;
<lb/>then, if <persName>Kaus</persName> still <sic>biddeth</sic> thee, fight on ;
<lb/>tis but a trifle if not trifled with.
<lb/>Or wouldst thou rest? It may be done with ease;
<lb/>to beg thy father’s pardon is no shame.
<lb/>If thou wilt send the hostages to him
<lb/>his heart and gloomy soul will smile; if thou
<lb/>art so concerned about them let them go,
<lb/>there is no hostage for thyself. This letter
<lb/>Commandeth war, and all may yet be well,
<lb/>for if <persName>Kaus</persName> doth bid us we will fight,
<lb/>and bring our foes to straits. Think not vain thoughts,
<lb/>but capture him by <sic>complaisance</sic>, and cause not
<lb/>bad times for us now that the tree of power
<lb/>is fruiting; fill not eyes and crown and throne
<lb/>with blood, and shrivel not the royal tree.
<lb/>Ill will befall throne, crown, host, camp, and court

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.585"/>
<lb/>without thee, for the brain-pan of <persName>Kaus</persName> 
<lb/>is as a Fane of Fire, his war and letter
<lb/>are both absurd; but if heaven’s purposes
<lb/>oppose my <sic>rede</sic>, why say I more?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The prince
<lb/>refused the counsel of those two wise men,
<lb/>so heaven willed. He said: <q>The Shah’s command —
<lb/>is higher than the sun and moon to me;
<lb/>yet none from straws to elephants and lions
<lb/>may brave God’s word, and he that <sic>disobeyeth</sic>
<lb/>hath troubled wits and is beside himself.
<lb/>Must I put forth my hand for shedding blood,
<lb/>and lead two kingdoms into war? Besides
<lb/>he is aggrieved about the hostages,
<lb/>and will demand again what I refused ;

<pb n="252"/>

<lb/>while if I quit the field, returning home
<lb/>without a fight, the Shah will be incensed
<lb/>and in his fury harm me. If your hearts
<lb/>are troubled by my action heed me not;
<lb/>I will be mine own guide and messenger,
<lb/>and quit the camp-enclosure on the waste.
<lb/>When one is no <sic>partaker</sic> in my gains
<lb/>why should he take to heart my pains?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>When thus

<lb/>he spake the souls of those two chieftains withered ;
<lb/>they wept at dread of parting and consumed
<lb/>as in fierce fire; they saw the evil eye
<lb/>of fortune secretly upon the prince,
<lb/>that they would never look on him again,
<lb/>and wept his case. Said <persName>Zanga</persName>: <q>We are slaves:
<lb/>love for our leader <sic>filleth</sic> both our hearts.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.586"/>
<lb/>Now may our souls and bodies ransom thee,
<lb/>and may our loyalty endure till death.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The gentle, prudent prince replied to <persName>Zanga</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Go tell <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> of what hath chanced.
<lb/>Say: <q>Through this peace my lot is one of war:
<lb/>thine are the sweets, the pang and poison mine,
<lb/>yet will I keep my covenant with thee
<lb/>albeit I shall lose the throne of might.
<lb/>God is my refuge, heaven my covering,
<lb/>the ground my throne. I rashly disobeyed
<lb/>and <sic>cannot</sic> face the Shah. Give me a cistern
<lb/>where God <sic>appointeth</sic> and I may not hear
<lb/>aught of the evil nature of my sire,
<lb/>but find for once a respite from his ire.</q></q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<head>How <persName>Zanga</persName> went to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>So <persName>Zanga</persName>, with a hundred noble horsemen,
<lb/>bore from the prince’s court the hostages,

<pb n="253"/>

<lb/>and all the goods that <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> had brought.

<lb/>When <persName>Zanga</persName> reached the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> monarch’s city

<lb/>a shout ascended and the watch espied him.

<lb/>A noble warrior <persName>Tuwurg</persName> by name

<lb/>went forth to welcome him. At audience

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> arose, embraced him warmly,

<lb/>and set him by the throne, where he presented

<lb/>the letter and delivered all the message.

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> was much <sic>disquieted</sic>

<lb/>and, having ordered fitting entertainment

<lb/>for <persName>Zanga</persName>, called his captain of the host,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.587"/>
<lb/>who came like smoke. Now when <persName>Piran</persName> arrived <ref target="n.253.1"/>

<lb/>the monarch cleared the room and spake with him

<lb/>about <persName>Kaus</persName> and his intemperate words,

<lb/>his evil nature and his warlike projects.

<lb/>Afrasiydéb looked grave, his heart was full

<lb/>for <persName>Siyawush</persName>. He told of <persName>Zanga</persName>’s coming,

<lb/>and asked: <q> What remedy shall I employ,

<lb/>how make a league in this embarrassment ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>O king! live happily

<lb/>while time shall be. Thou art more wise than we are,

<lb/>in treasure and in manhood mightier ;

<lb/>in apprehension, kindness, understanding,

<lb/>and counsel, none hath wit to supersede thee.

<lb/>All that have power to benefit this prince

<lb/>will grudge not toil and treasure. I have heard

<lb/>that there is no chief like him in the world

<lb/>in stature, countenance, and gentleness,

<lb/>in culture, counsel, and propriety.

<lb/>His prowess and his wisdom too exceed

<lb/>his noble birth. No monarch hath begotten

<lb/>another such; words <sic>cannot</sic> do him justice.

<lb/>He is a prince illustrious and right royal.

<lb/>If he possessed no virtue but this one—

<note xml:id="n.253.1">From this point <persName>Piran</persName>, <q>a <sic>verray</sic> <sic>parfit</sic> gentil knight,</q> plays an important part in the poem. Cf. vol. i. p. 55.</note>

<pb n="254"/>

<lb/>that he hath quarrelled with his sire to save
<lb/>our hundred nobles' lives, given up the throne
<lb/>and crown to meaner men, and gone his way,
<lb/>'<sic>twould</sic> not be politic to let him pass
<lb/>from us. Besides <persName>Kaus</persName> is hoary now;
<lb/>the time hath come for him to quit the throne;

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.588"/>
<lb/>but <persName>Siyawush</persName> is youthful, hath the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,
<lb/>and will succeed. The nobles would condemn thee,
<lb/>and <persName>Siyawush</persName> himself would be aggrieved.
<lb/>If now the king in wisdom shall see fit
<lb/>let him dispatch to this wise youth a letter
<lb/>entreating him as men <sic>entreat</sic> their children;
<lb/>prepare him here a dwelling, entertain him
<lb/>with fitting honour, give him a princess
<lb/>to wife, and let him be esteemed and cherished.
<lb/>If he remain thy realm will be in peace,
<lb/>if he go home thy fortune will be bettered,
<lb/>for he will be in favour with the Shah,
<lb/>and honoured by the nobles; both the hosts
<lb/>may rest, God making him the instrument.
<lb/>It would be worthy of the Maker's justice
<lb/>to rectify the age in this regard.</q>
<lb/>The monarch listened to <persName>Piran</persName> and, seeing
<lb/>what would result, took time to estimate
<lb/>the good and ill thereof; he then rejoined :—
<lb/><q>Thou <sic>counsellest</sic> well. Among the chosen chiefs
<lb/>and veterans thou art incomparable ;
<lb/>yet have I heard an adage to the point :—
<lb/><q>If thou <sic>shouldst</sic> make a lion’s whelp thy pet,
<lb/>and foster it however tenderly,
<lb/>still, when its teeth and claws are grown, regret
<lb/>will be thy lot. The brute will turn on thee.</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said: <q>Let the king of warriors look
<lb/>with wisdom on this matter. Can ill nature
<lb/><sic>befit</sic> one who hath not inherited
<lb/>the ill nature and <sic>perverseness</sic> of his sire ?

<lb/>dost thou not see that <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> is old

<lb/>thus wilt thou gain both realms, their crown and state:

<head>How <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> wrote to <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, when he had heard this, took

<lb/>a wise resolve, called an experienced scribe

<lb/>and spake to him at large about the matter.

<lb/>The scribe first dipped his pen in <sic>ambergris</sic>,

<lb/>then wrote the Maker’s praise, acknowledging

<lb/>his might and wisdom: <q>Since He is above

<lb/>both time and place how can His slaves' thoughts reach
<lb/>to Him—the Lord of wisdom, sense, and soul,
<lb/>whose justice is the <sic>provand</sic> of the sage ?

<lb/>His benediction be upon the prince—

<lb/>the lord of helm and mace and scimitar,

<lb/>the lord of modesty and reverence,

<lb/>pure from wrongdoing both in heart and hand.
<lb/>From wary <persName>Zanga</persName> son of <persName>Shawaran</persName>

<lb/>have I heard all thy message, and my heart

<lb/>is troubled that the world-lord is enraged

<lb/>so much against thee; but what seek the wise,
<lb/>whose fortunes are awake, save crown and throne ?
<lb/>Here everything hath been prepared for thee,

<lb/>e’en to the royal dignity and treasures,

<lb/>for all <placeName>Turan</placeName> will do thee reverence, -

<lb/>and I for my part long to have thy love.

<lb/>Then thou and I will be as son and sire—

<lb/>a sire who is a slave before his son.

<lb/>Know that <persName>Kaus</persName> hath never shown affection

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.590"/>
<lb/>for thee like mine, for I will <sic>ope</sic> my heart, 

<pb n="256"/>

<lb/>my hoards, and hand, provide thee with a home,
<lb/>protect thee like a son, and leave thee here

<lb/>as my memorial. Shouldst thou go elsewhere
<lb/>I should be blamed by high and low alike;

<lb/>and thou wilt find the going difficult,

<lb/>except by Providence and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> divine,

<lb/>for yonder thou must lose the sight of land,
<lb/>and cross the sea of <placeName>Chin</placeName>. If no constraint

<lb/>is put on thee by God come as a friend.

<lb/>Troops, treasure, gold, and city all are thine,
<lb/>and thou shalt need no pretext for departing,
<lb/>for when thou wouldst be friendly with thy sire,
<lb/>I will provide thee crown and throne and girdle,
<lb/>with soldiers to escort thee to <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>and bear thee company myself for love.

<lb/>The quarrel with thy father will not last ;
<lb/>at his age he will soon be sick of strife.
<lb/>If fire <sic>appeareth</sic> after sixty-five
<lb/>it cometh hardly from the <sic>damps</sic> of age.
<lb/><placeName>Iran</placeName> and host and treasure will be thine,
<lb/>and crown with sovereignty from <sic>clime</sic> to <sic>clime</sic> ;
<lb/>moreover I have sworn by holy God
<lb/>to labour, soul and body, for thy welfare.
<lb/>I will not harm thee by myself or others,
<lb/>or wrong thee even in thought.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>He sealed the letter,
<lb/>then bade his good friend <persName>Zanga</persName> gird his loins
<lb/>to go with speed, and gave him many gifts
<lb/>of gold and silver, and a steed caparisoned
<lb/>with massive gold. When <persName>Zanga</persName> gave his tidings
<lb/>the prince was glad and sorry too to make
<lb/>his foe a friend. Would fire give cooling breezes ?

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> gave up the Host to <persName>Bahram</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> wrote thus to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>
<lb/>to tell him all: <q>Though young I want not wits.
<lb/>While I have done no wrong, the world-lord’s temper
<lb/>hath burned my heart within me. First <persName>Sudaba</persName>
<lb/>occasioned trouble; I was forced to traverse
<lb/>a mount of fire; my heart’s blood bathed my cheeks,
<lb/>and in the wastes the deer wept sore for me.
<lb/>Then went I forth in shame and woe to face
<lb/>the claws of Crocodiles. Both kingdoms now
<lb/>enjoy repose, yet is the Shah’s heart like
<lb/>a sword of steel; my doings please him not,
<lb/>and if I bind or loose 'tis all the same.
<lb/>Since he is weary of me I will cease
<lb/>to trouble him. Ne’er may his heart lack joy.
<lb/>As for myself I seek the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s breath
<lb/>in sorrow, doubtful what the turning sky
<lb/>Intendeth for me—whether hate or love.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then said he to <persName>Bahram</persName>: <q>Now give thy name
<lb/>fresh glory in the world; I leave with thee
<lb/>the baggage and the camp, the cavaliers,
<lb/>the treasure, elephants, and kettledrums.
<lb/>When noble <persName>Tus</persName> shall come, resign thy charge
<lb/>to him, be vigilant and fortunate.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He chose three hundred doughty cavaliers,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.592"/>
<lb/>had brought to him such money as he needed, 
<lb/>with jewels fit for kings, a hundred steeds
<lb/>with golden furniture, a hundred slave boys
<lb/>with golden belts, and had a reckoning made
<lb/>of weapons, beasts, and girdles. Then he summoned
<lb/>the nobles, spake in many gracious words
<lb/>to them, and said: <q> <persName>Piran</persName> hath crossed the river.

<lb/>Sent by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> on secret business


<pb n="258"/>

<lb/>to me, because his people trust in him.
<lb/>I go to meet him; ye must tarry here,
<lb/>look to <persName>Bahram</persName> for orders and obey
<lb/>him loyally.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The chiefs all kissed the ground
<lb/>before the glorious <persName>Siyawush</persName>.

</p><p>
<lb/>At sunset,

<lb/>when air grew dark and earth <sic>ungenial</sic>,
<lb/>the prince, his face obscured by tears, marched forth
<lb/>toward <placeName>Jihun</placeName> with all his company,
<lb/>when he had reached <placeName>Tirmid</placeName>, doors, roofs, and streets
<lb/>were full of scent and colour like the spring
<lb/>up to the gates of <placeName>Chach</placeName> : thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>It is a bride with crown and necklaces.</q>
<lb/>At every stage were carpets laid and <sic>viands</sic>
<lb/>prepared, the whole way to <placeName>Kachar Bashi</placeName>,
<lb/>where he dismounted and remained a while.
</p><p>
<lb/>When <persName>Tus</persName> reached <placeName>Balkh</placeName> they told him bitter news :—
<lb/><q> The son of glorious <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> hath gone
<lb/>to join the leader of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host.</q>


</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> called in all the troops and marched them back


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.593"/>

<lb/>to court. The news made <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> turn pale ;
<lb/>he mourned and heaved a deep, cold sigh; his heart
<lb/>was full of fire, his eye of tears for wrath
<lb/>with <persName>Siyawush</persName> and with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;
<lb/>but, doubtful if the sky would prove a friend
<lb/>or enemy, he put away his anger,
<lb/>and thought no more of warfare and revenge.

</p><p>
<lb/>On hearing: <q><persName>Siyawush</persName> hath crossed the river
<lb/>with troops to us, his envoy hath arrived,</q>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> bade all the chief estates
<lb/>go forth with kettledrums to welcome him.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> chose out one thousand of his kin
<lb/>to meet the prince with gifts, apprised the host,
<lb/>and gat him ready four white elephants.
<lb/>One bore a turquoise throne backed by a flag

<pb n="259"/>

<lb/>of tree-like size, surmounted by a moon;
<lb/>the flag was gold-embroidered violet silk ;
<lb/>upon the golden throne were three gold seats,
<lb/>and each of them was covered with brocade.
<lb/>There were a hundred noble steeds whose saddles
<lb/>were jewelled gold. The host, thou wouldst have said,
<lb/>was like the earth when graced by heavens love.

<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> had heard: <q>A company
<lb/>hath come,</q> perceived the banner of <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>and heard the sound of elephants and steeds,
<lb/>he hurried forth, embraced <persName>Piran</persName>, inquired
<lb/>about the king and kingdom, and exclaimed :—
<lb/><q> Why hast thou vexed thy soul by coming hither,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.594"/>
<lb/>o captain of the host? My heart’s first wish 
<lb/>was to behold thee safe and sound.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>kissed his fair, charming face, his head and feet,
<lb/>and thus addressed the Maker: <q>Thou know’st all things,
<lb/>the open and the secret. Hadst Thou shown me
<lb/>his soul in dreams, in sooth mine <sic>agéd</sic> head
<lb/>had been made young.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He said to <persName>Siyawush</persName> :-—

<lb/><q> Now that I see thee radiant and robust
<lb/>I offer praises to Almighty God.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will be a father to thee,
<lb/>the chiefs this side the stream will be thy slaves.
<lb/>Above a thousand of my kin will wait
<lb/>on thee with earrings in their ears, my treasures
<lb/>are all thine own; be ever hale and happy.
<lb/>Draw not a single breath of discontent,
<lb/>for men and women are alike thy slaves,
<lb/>and, if thou wilt accept my hoary head,
<lb/>I too will gird my loins to do thee service.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They went with joy, discussing divers matters,
<lb/>while through the city there were sounds of harp

<pb n="260"/>

<lb/>and <sic>rebeck</sic> ; sleepy heads were roused ; the soil
<lb/>was blackened with fresh musk; the <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steeds
<lb/>all spread their wings. When <persName>Siyawush</persName> saw this
<lb/>tears rained from both his eyes, his thoughts were troubled,
<lb/>for he recalled the <sic>hocktide</sic> in <placeName>Zabul</placeName>
<lb/>when it was decked up to <placeName>Kabulistan</placeName>,
<lb/>and he had gone as guest to <persName>Rustam</persName> there
<lb/>with all the famous men for company,
<lb/>and how the folk had showered down gold and gems,
<lb/>and sifted musk and <sic>ambergris</sic> o’<sic>erhead</sic>.
<lb/>He thought about <placeName>Iran</placeName> and heaved a sigh,
<lb/>his heart burned with the memories of home.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.595"/>
<lb/>He turned his head to hide this from <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>albeit that chieftain marked the grief and pain:
<lb/>he understood the thoughts of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>grew sorrowful himself and bit his lips.
<lb/>They lighted at <placeName>Kachar Bashi</placeName> to breathe
<lb/>awhile. <persName>Piran</persName> scanned <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and marked
<lb/>with wondering eyes his speech, breast, neck, and shoulders,
<lb/>invoked God’s name, and said: <q>Illustrious prince!
<lb/>Thou art the memory of sovereigns,
<lb/>and hast three things that not a prince beside
<lb/>Possesseth. First, thou <sic>makest</sic> men discern
<lb/>the nature of the seed of <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>;
<lb/>while secondly, thou hast adorned thy tongue
<lb/>with such uprightness and such goodly speech ;
<lb/>and thirdly, one would say: <q>Thy face <sic>distilleth</sic>
<lb/>thy love on earth in showers.</q></q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The prince replied :—
<lb/><q>O venerable sage who <sic>sayest</sic> sooth,
<lb/>world-famed for thy sincerity and love,
<lb/>far from unkindness and from <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> !
<lb/>If thou wilt make a covenant with me
<lb/>I know that thou wilt keep it, and will make

<pb n="261"/>

<lb/>this land my home in love and confidence
<lb/>in thee, my friend! and, if my sojourn here
<lb/>is well, I need not weep for what I did:
<lb/>if otherwise command me to depart,
<lb/>and point me out the way to other realms.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied : <q>Have no such thought. Since thou
<lb/>hast left <placeName>Iran</placeName>, in no wise hasten from us,
<lb/>and lose our monarch’s love. Though his repute
<lb/>in this world is not good, he is a man
<lb/>of God, hath wisdom, prudence, and high <sic>rede</sic>,
<lb/>and <sic>turneth</sic> not in lightness to bad ways.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.596"/>

<lb/>He is my blood-relation <ref target="n.261.1"/> too; with him 
<lb/>I have, as paladin and counsellor,
<lb/>high rank, abundant treasures, thrones, and troops.
<lb/>Above a hundred thousand cavaliers
<lb/>obey me here. Twelve thousand of my kinsmen
<lb/>stand day and night before me. I have land,
<lb/>flocks, <sic>lassos</sic>, bows, steeds, implements of war,
<lb/>and hoarded treasure; I need no man’s aid.
<lb/>Let all this be thy ransom if thou wilt
<lb/>abide with us. I swear by Holy God
<lb/>that I will serve thee both with heart and soul.
<lb/>I will not suffer any ill to thee... 
<lb/>But no man <sic>knoweth</sic> high heaven’s purposes.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The prince rejoiced, his heart was freed from care.
<lb/>They sat and ate, and grew like sire and son,

<head>The Interview of <persName>Siyawush</persName> with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>On hearing: <q>Glorious <persName>Siyawush</persName> hath come,</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.597"/>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> descended to the street 

<note xml:id="n.261.1"><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> and <persName>Piran</persName> were cousins.</note>


<pb n="262"/>

<lb/>afoot with girded loins right eagerly.
<lb/>The prince beholding him got off his horse
<lb/>and ran to meet the king. The two embraced,
<lb/>and kissed each other’s head and eyes. Then said
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>: <q>Now evil is asleep
<lb/>throughout the world; henceforward war and tumult
<lb/>will cease; the deer and <sic>pard</sic> will drink together.
<lb/>The world was troubled by brave <persName>Tur</persName>, but now
<lb/>our realms are sick of strife; while they were filled
<lb/>with turmoil the world’s heart had no repose;
<lb/>peace is restored by thee; the age hath rest
<lb/>from battle and hot blood, all in <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>are now thy slaves, all hearts are full of love
<lb/>for thee ; in soul and body I am thine;
<lb/>piran the general is thy kinsman too.
<lb/>I will regard thee with a father’s fondness,
<lb/>and ever show to thee a face all smiles.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> with many blessings answered :—
<lb/><q>May justice be the fortune of thy race.
<lb/>Praise to the Lord, the Maker of the soul,
<lb/>from Whom are peace and battle and revenge.</q>

<lb/>The monarch, hand in hand with <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>sat on the throne of might, and as he gazed
<lb/>upon the prince, said: <q> None can equal him
<lb/>on earth in stature, looks, and kingly <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.598"/>

<lb/>Then to <persName>Piran</persName>: <q> <persName>Kaus</persName> is old and witless
<lb/>to lose sight of a son so tall and gifted
<lb/>as this. I marvelled, when I first beheld him,
<lb/>how any man with such a son could look
<lb/>at aught besides.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He made choice of a palace,

<lb/>laid cloth of gold for carpets, set a throne
<lb/>of gold with feet like heads of buffaloes,
<lb/>bedecked the palace with brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>and furnished it throughout, then bade his guest
<lb/>go thither and abide in full content.</p>


<pb n="263"/>

<p>
<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> arrived before the hall
<lb/>its dome reached <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>, he went in and sat
<lb/>upon the golden throne, his wise soul wrapped
<lb/>in thought, until the monarch’s board was spread,
<lb/>and he was summoned; there they talked together,
<lb/>and entered on a course of happiness.
</p><p>
<lb/>The banquet o’er they went with harp and minstrel
<lb/>to hold a drinking-bout. They sat and quaffed
<lb/>until the world grew dark and heads <sic>becaine</sic>
<lb/>bemused with wine, then <persName>Siyawush</persName> went home
<lb/>with glee, and in his cups forgot <placeName>Iran</placeName>.

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> gave heart and soul to him,

<lb/>and could not sleep for thinking. That same night


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.599"/>
<lb/>he said to Shida :<ref target="n.263.1"/> <q> When the morn shall come, 
<lb/>and <persName>Siyawush</persName> hath risen, go to him

<lb/>with mine own kinsmen and the paladins

<lb/>of highest rank, take with you noble steeds

<lb/>caparisoned with gold, and other gifts.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Accordingly the warriors presented
<lb/>to <persName>Siyawush</persName> gold coins and royal gems
<lb/>with courteous greetings, and the king too sent
<lb/>him many gifts. Thus was one <sic>sennight</sic> spent.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> displayed his Prowess before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>One night the king spake thus to <persName>Siyawush</persName> :-—
<lb/><q>To-morrow morning let us play at polo;
<lb/>I hear that none among the warriors
<lb/>can face thy mall on thine own ground.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><q>O king!</q>
<lb/>Said <persName>Siyawush</persName>, <q>be fortunate and ever
<lb/>beyond the reach of ill! Kings look to thee
<lb/>for teaching ; who <sic>surpasseth</sic> thee? Day <sic>shineth</sic>
<lb/>when I behold thee, from thee I accept
<lb/>both good and ill.</q>

<note xml:id="n.263.1"> His son.</note>




<pb n="264"/>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Myson! be ever glad and conquering.
<lb/>Thou art.a prince, the glory of the throne,
<lb/>a royal crown and backbone of the host.</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.600"/>

</p><p>


<lb/>They went out laughing to the Ground at morn
<lb/>in gallant trim. Then said <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>to <persName>Siyawush</persName> : <q> Let us be opposites,
<lb/>select our partners, and make up our sides.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He answered : <q> What will hand and mall avail ?
<lb/>I <sic>cannot</sic> play against thee. Take some other
<lb/>as thine antagonist, I am thy partner—
<lb/>one of thy horsemen on this spacious Ground.</q>



</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch was delighted at his words,
<lb/>Esteeming those of others only wind.
<lb/><q>Nay, by the life and head of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>,</q>
<lb/>Said he, <q>thou shalt be friend and opposite.
<lb/>Display thy prowess to the cavaliers,
<lb/>so that they may not say: <q>He chose amiss,</q>
<lb/>but give thee praise while I laugh out with wonder.</q>



</p><p>


<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> replied: <q>Tis thine to bid:
<lb/>the cavaliers, the Ground, and malls are thine.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> selected for his side
<lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName>, <persName>Pulad</persName>, <persName>Piran</persName>, <persName>Jahn</persName>, <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>with <persName>Nastihan</persName> the gallant, and <persName>Human</persName>,
<lb/>who would drive balls from water. Then the king
<lb/>sent over to the side of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>ruin, illustrious Shida, and <persName>Arjasp</persName>
<lb/>the mounted Lion, and <persName>Andariman</persName>
<lb/>the doughty cavalier.2. Said <persName>Siyawush</persName> :—
<lb/><q> Ambitious king! will any of these dare
<lb/>to face the ball? They side with thee, while I
<lb/>shall have to play alone and watch them too.
<lb/>So with the king’s leave I will bring to help me
<lb/>a few Iranian players on the Ground

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.601"/>
<lb/>in order that both sides may play the game.</q>

</p>

<note xml:id="n.264.1">Cf. p. 119.</note>
<note xml:id="n.264.2">For most of the above names see vol. i. p. 92.</note>

<pb n="265"/>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch heard the words, gave his consent,
<lb/>and from the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> <persName>Siyawush</persName> chose seven
<lb/>well skilled. The <sic>tymbals</sic> sounded, dust arose,
<lb/>while what with cymbal-clash and clarion-blare
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>The ground is all a-quake!</q>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> hit off and drove the ball
<lb/>up to the clouds just as it should be struck.

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> urged on his steed and smote
<lb/>the ball, or ever it could reach the ground,

<lb/>so stoutly that it disappeared from sight.
<lb/>Thereat the exalted monarch bade his men

<lb/>to give another ball to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>who as he took it kissed it, and there rose

<lb/>a flourish from the pipes and kettledrums.

<lb/>He mounted a fresh steed, threw up the ball,
<lb/>and drove it out of sight to see the moon.

<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The sky attracted it.</q>
<lb/>There was not on the ground his peer, and none,
<lb/>had such a beaming face. The monarch laughed,
<lb/>the nobles grew attentive and exclaimed :—

<lb/><q> We never saw a rider like this chief!</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The famous monarch said: <q>Of such a kind
<lb/>is each one gifted with the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of God ;

<lb/>but <persName>Siyawush</persName> hath bettered all report.</q>

<lb/>The attendants set a throne beside the Ground,
<lb/>the monarch beaming sat down with the prince,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.602"/>
<lb/>and told the company: <q>The Ground and balls 
<lb/>are at your service.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> played
<lb/>a match with the <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs>. Dust flew up
<lb/>with shouts as these or those bore off the ball;
<lb/>but when the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> played too angrily
<lb/>in their endeavours to obtain a goal,
<lb/>and when the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> intercepted them
<lb/>so that the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' efforts were in vain,
<lb/>displeased with his own people <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<pb n="266"/>


<lb/>cried to them in the olden Persian tongue :—
<lb/><q>Is this a playground, or would ye cause strife
<lb/>in our dependent and precarious state ?
<lb/>When ye are near the limits look aside
<lb/>and let the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> have the ball for once.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>His horsemen rode more gently after this
<lb/>and did not heat their steeds, then as the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>
<lb/>were shouting for a goal <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>perceived the purpose of the words, and said :—
<lb/><q>I have been told by one of mine own friends
<lb/>that <persName>Siyawush</persName> hath no peer in the world
<lb/>for archery and might of neck and shoulder.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Thereat the prince <sic>uncased</sic> his royal bow ;
<lb/>the monarch, having asked to see it first
<lb/>that one of his own kin might prove its strength,
<lb/>regarded it with wonder, and invoked
<lb/>full many a royal blessing, then presented
<lb/>the bow to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> the <sic>sworder</sic>, saying :—
<lb/><q> Bend thou this bow and string it.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>That malignant
<lb/>failed, to his great amazement. <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.603"/>
<lb/>took back the bow and sitting on his knees
<lb/>bent it and strung it, smiling. Said the king :—
<lb/><q> With this one might shoot over sky and moon!
<lb/>I too in days of youth had such a bow,
<lb/>but times are changed, and no one in our lands
<lb/>would dare to grasp this bow when war is toward,
<lb/>save <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and he with such a chest
<lb/>and arms would wish none other on his charger.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They placed a target on the riding-ground,
<lb/>and <persName>Siyawush</persName>, who challenged none to shoot,
<lb/>bestrode his wind-foot charger like a div,
<lb/>gripped with his legs, and shouted as he went.
<lb/>In sight of all the chiefs his arrow hit
<lb/>the bull’s eye. Then he set upon his bow
<lb/>another shaft, of poplar wood, four feathered,

<pb n="267"/>

<lb/>and in the same course hit the second time.

<lb/>Next wheeling to the right he hit the target

<lb/>just as he would. This being done he flung

<lb/>the bow upon his arm, approached the king,

<lb/>and lighted from his steed. The monarch rose :—

<lb/><q>Thy skill,</q> said he, <q>is witness to thy race.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Returning to the lofty palace thence

<lb/>they went with happy hearts as bosom-friends ;

<lb/>there took their seats, arranged a drinking-bout,

<lb/>and summoned skilful minstrels to attend.

<lb/>They quaffed no little wine, grew glorious,

<lb/>and drank the health of <persName>Siyawush</persName>. The king

<lb/>while sitting at the board arranged a gift—

<lb/>a horse and trappings, throne and diadem,

<lb/>uncut stuffs, such as none had seen before,

<lb/>gold coins, and silver coins in bags, <sic>turquoises</sic>,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.604"/>
<lb/>with many girl and boy slaves, and a cup 

<lb/>which brimmed with shining rubies. Then the king

<lb/>commanded to count up those precious gifts,

<lb/>and certain of the dearest of his kinsmen

<lb/>to bear them to the house of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.

<lb/>Thus said he to his troops: <q>In everything

<lb/>regard the prince as if he were your king.</q>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> said to the prince: <q>Come with me
<lb/>some day a-hunting to refresh our hearts,
<lb/>and banish all our troubles in the chase.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><q>Whene'er thou wilt,</q> he answered, <q> <sic>whereso</sic>’er
<lb/>thy heart <sic>disposeth</sic> thee to lead the way.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>One day they went. The king took hawks and cheetahs,
<lb/>and many of <placeName>Iran</placeName> and of <placeName>Turan</placeName>

<pb n="268"/>

<lb/>of all conditions hastened to the meet.

<lb/>The prince spied <sic>onager</sic> upon the plain,

<lb/>and, sped from his companions like the wind,

<lb/>with reins held lightly and feet firmly pressed

<lb/>he galloped o’er the hollows and the hills,

<lb/>and, having,cloven an <sic>onager</sic> in halves,

<lb/>made them the silver and his hands the scales,

<lb/>and found the two sides equal to a grain.

<lb/>The king and all his train watched eagerly,

<lb/>exclaiming : <q>What a noble swordsman this!</q>

<lb/>And one man to another called and said :—

<lb/><q>Tl from <placeName>Iran</placeName> hath come on us <sic>erewhile</sic>,

<lb/>and our brave leaders have been put to shame:

<lb/>now is the time to fight against the Shah.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Siyawush</persName> still chased his <sic>onagers</sic>

<lb/>and spread destruction over all the plain.

<lb/>He galloped over valley, hill, and waste,

<lb/>employing arrow, spear, and scimitar.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.605"/>

<lb/>Where’er he went he piled a heap of game,

<lb/>and killed enough for all the company.

<lb/>Thence to the palace of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>they took their way with gladness in their hearts.

</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch in his pleasures and his griefs

<lb/>held intercourse with none but <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>confided not in <persName>Jahn</persName> and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,

<lb/>or other such; he took no joy in them,

<lb/>but passed with <persName>Siyawush</persName> his days and nights

<lb/>in merriment. Thus while a year went by

<lb/>they shared all griefs and pleasures equally.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
<head>How <persName>Piran</persName> gave his Daughter to <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>One day <persName>Piran</persName> conversed with <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>and in the course of talk said: <q>In this land
<lb/>what man <sic>surpasseth</sic> thee? Our monarch’s love

<pb n="269"/>

<lb/>doth make him talk of thee e’en in his sleep.
<lb/>Know that thou art to him as <sic>jocund</sic> spring,
<lb/>his idol, and the solace of his griefs.
<lb/>Great art thou and the son of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>;
<lb/>thy many virtues raise thee to the moon;
<lb/>yet since thy sire is old, and thy heart young,
<lb/>see that thou lose not the imperial throne.
<lb/>Thou art a king both here and in <placeName>Iran</placeName>—
<lb/>a noble monument of former monarchs—
<lb/>yet see I none, among thy blood-relations,
<lb/>that <sic>looketh</sic> on thee with abundant love!
<lb/>Throughout <placeName>Turan</placeName> I find none fit to be
<lb/>thy peer, thy partner, or antagonist.
<lb/>Thou hast no brother, wife, or sister; thou
<lb/>art like a single rose-branch in a coppice.
<lb/>Look for a consort worthy of thyself,
<lb/>and cease to sorrow and regret <placeName>Iran</placeName>;
<lb/>it will be thine when <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> is dead,
<lb/>and thine will be the crown and warriors' throne.
<lb/>The curtains of the king conceal three maidens,
<lb/>all richly <sic>dight</sic>, such that the moon itself
<lb/>perforce must gaze upon, and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.606"/>
<lb/>hath also three of noble race on both sides 
<lb/>through <persName>Faridun</persName> related to the Shah,
<lb/>with crowns and high estate. I too have four—
<lb/>slaves if thou wilt. The eldest-born—<persName>Jarira</persName>—
<lb/>unmatched among the fair shall be thy handmaid.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName>: <q>I give thee thanks. Henceforth

<lb/>regard me as thy son. She is the <sic>meetest</sic>
<lb/>because for me alliance with thy house
<lb/>is best. She will rejoice my soul and body :
<lb/>I want none else; herein thou <sic>layest</sic> on me
<lb/>a life-long obligation.</q>


</p><p>


<lb/>When <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>left <persName>Siyawush</persName> he hasted to <persName>Gulshahr</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>Prepare <persName>Jarira</persName>’s wedding outfit

<pb n="270"/>

<lb/>in favour of the exalted <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>Shall not we joy to-day when we receive
<lb/>the grandson of <persName>Kubad</persName> as son-in-law ?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Gulshahr</persName> led forth her daughter, having set
<lb/>a coronet upon the maiden’s head,
<lb/>arrayed her with brocade, gold, <sic>drachms</sic>, dinars,
<lb/>adorned and scented her like <sic>jocund</sic> spring,
<lb/>and then presented her to <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>They thus espoused her to the prince, and set her
<lb/>like a new moon upon the throne. None knew

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.607"/>

<lb/>what wealth she brought, how many golden seats
<lb/>inlaid with gems. When <persName>Siyawush</persName> beheld
<lb/>her face she pleased him, and he laughed for gladness.
<lb/>He <sic>joyed</sic> in her by night and day: his heart
<lb/>forgot <persName>Kaus</persName>.

<lb/>Thus heaven revolved awhile,

<lb/>The good <persName>Piran</persName> said to the prince one day :—
<lb/><q>Thou <sic>knowest</sic> that the king our sovereign lord
<lb/>Exalteth o’er the dome of heaven his crown,

<lb/>and that by night and day thou art his soul,

<lb/>his heart and intellect, his might and wisdom ;

<lb/>thou wouldst increase in greatness with each breath.
<lb/>Now since my daughter hath become thy wife

<lb/>I tender all thy interests great and small,

<lb/>and though <persName>Jarira</persName> hath much charm, and thou
<lb/>didst choose her out of all, it would become thee

<lb/>to take a jewel from our monarch’s skirt.

<lb/>Of his fair daughters <persName>Farangis</persName> is best:

<pb n="271"/>

<lb/>thou wilt see nowhere else such face and hair.
<lb/>She <sic>bettereth</sic> the cypress-tree in stature ;
<lb/>her musky tresses form a sable <sic>erown</sic> ;
<lb/>her parts and knowledge pass her loveliness,
<lb/>while wisdom <sic>standeth</sic> as a slave before her.
<lb/>Thou <sic>mayst</sic> well ask her of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Where is a beauty like her in <placeName>Kashmir</placeName>,

<lb/>With thy permission I will speak to him,
<lb/>and thus win from him favour for myself.</q>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> gazed on <persName>Piran</persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>God’s word must be fulfilled ; none can withstand

<lb/>do as thou <sic>sayest</sic> and arrange a match,

</p><p>
<lb/>While thus he spake he heaved a deep, cold sigh,
<lb/>and filled the lashes of his eyes with tears.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> made answer: <q>Every man of wisdom

<lb/>Thou canst not scape the turning of the sky

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, thus having learned the prince’s wishes

<lb/>in merry pin, dismounted, was admitted,
<lb/>and stood awhile before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>until the king, who loved him well, spake thus :—
<lb/><q>Why <sic>standest</sic> thou before-me this long while ?
<lb/>What wish hast thou on earth? What is thy purpose ?
<lb/>My host, my treasures, and my gold are thine,
<lb/>for me thou <sic>profitest</sic> in every thing.

<q>I have grown blithe of heart and covet fame.

<lb/>Why lay upon thy soul a fruitless task ?
<lb/>Thou <sic>toilest</sic> to complete his excellence,
<lb/>but at his fruiting thou wilt cease to bear.
<lb/>His <sic>fosterer</sic> will be the first to feel
<lb/>his claws when he is strong enough to fight.</q>
<lb/>again, in presence of the mighty men,
<lb/>Archmages <sic>learnéd</sic> in astrology
<lb/>took observations with their <sic>astrolabes</sic>,
<lb/>and all gave utterance to the same effect
<lb/>that my child’s son would do me wondrous hurt,
<lb/>destroy my throne, my treasure, provinces,
<lb/>my host, and palace, and that I should find
<lb/>no place of refuge; he would seize the realm,
<lb/>and by his deeds bring evil on my head.
<lb/>Why should mine own hand plant a tree whose fruit
<lb/>is bane with <sic>colocynth</sic> for leaves? A child

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.611"/>
<lb/>sprung from <persName>Kaus</persName> and from <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> 
<lb/>would prove a fierce flame or an ocean-wave.
<lb/>I know not whether love will take the prince
<lb/>back to <placeName>Iran</placeName>, or fix all his regards
<lb/>on us; but why drink poison wittingly ?
<lb/>One must not lightly take a serpent’s breath.
<lb/>While he <sic>remaineth</sic> he shall be a brother
<lb/>to me, and if he <sic>goeth</sic> to <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>I will dispatch him to his sire in state
<lb/>on such wise as the All-just shall approve.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>O king! Let not thy heart
<lb/>be grieved <sic>hereat</sic>. Those born to <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>will be possessed of wits, reserved, and shrewd.
<lb/>Trust not what readers of the stars may say,
<lb/>deal with his case according to thy wisdom,
<lb/>for from this noble pair a prince will spring,
<lb/>whose head will be exalted to the sun





<pb n="274"/>

<lb/>as king both in <placeName>Iran</placeName> and in <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>Then those two kingdoms will repose from strife,
<lb/>the seed of <persName>Faridun</persName> and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>
<lb/>will ne’er produce a more illustrious Plant,
<lb/>while, if the sky shall purpose otherwise,
<lb/>no taking thought will make it love him more,
<lb/>what is to be will be beyond all doubt ;
<lb/>no caution <sic>minisheth</sic> what is to wax.
<lb/>See what a glorious enterprise is this !
<lb/>Ask what thou wilt of fortune and 'tis thine.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> replied: <q>Ill cometh never
<lb/>of thine advice. I order as thou <sic>wishest</sic> ;
<lb/>depart and carry out thy kindly purpose.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> bent low, did reverence, gave great praise,
<lb/>and so departed, came to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and told him all. That night the joyful pair

<lb/>Now when the sun upon the turning sky

<lb/>who was the chief wife of the paladin—
<lb/>a lady much esteemed and bright of mind.
<lb/>They chose the best things in the treasury—
<lb/>a thousand lengths of cloth of gold from <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>with emerald-studded plates, cups of turquoise
<lb/>filled with fresh aloe-wood and musk-deer’s glands,
<lb/>two crowns of jewels worthy of a king,

<lb/>two hundred servants bearing golden cups

<lb/>three hundred servants wearing crowns of gold,

<lb/>these with <persName>Gulshahr</persName> together with her sisters,
<lb/>in golden litters curtained with brocade,
<lb/>went in procession with the precious things.
<lb/>The lady took a hundred thousand coins—

<head>How <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> bestowed a Province on <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Thus passed the <sic>sennight</sic>, then the king prepared

<lb/>withal, helms, <sic>maces</sic>, <sic>lassos</sic>, and dinars,

<lb/>with purses full of <sic>drachms</sic>, suits of apparel,

<lb/>and things both great and small. They drew a list
<lb/>of lands and cities 'twixt the sea of <placeName>Chin</placeName>

<lb/>and their own march ; the region was in length

<lb/>a hundred leagues, its breadth no man could measure.
<lb/>For all that sovereignty in royal fashion

<lb/>they made the patent out on painted silk,

<lb/>which with a golden throne and golden crown

<lb/>the king sent to the house of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.

<pb n="277"/>

<lb/>he next prepared the hall of banqueting,
<lb/>and those that came to it from far and near
<lb/>found wine, and tables ready spread, and cooks;
<lb/>folks eat, and whatsoever each could carry
<lb/>he took away with him to his own home:
<lb/>the monarch’s guests thus passed a week in joy.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.615"/>
<lb/>He opened wide the dungeons' bolted doors, 
<lb/>exulting as the favourite of fortune.
<lb/>The eighth day <persName>Siyawush</persName> with brave <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>approached the king at dawn for leave to go
<lb/>to their own homes. Both offered compliments,
<lb/>and said: <q>O gracious <sic>worldlord</sic> ! may thy days
<lb/>be ever joyous and thy foes' backs bent.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Thence they returned rejoicing and their talk
<lb/>was all about the monarch of the world.

</p><p>

<lb/>Thus for a year in justice and in love
<lb/>the circling heaven turned and brought no care ;
<lb/>then from the presence of the monarch came
<lb/>a friendly messenger to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>The king saith : <q>O illustrious chieftain !
<lb/>I have bestowed upon thee all the realm
<lb/>from here to <placeName>Chin</placeName>: go round and view the lands.
<lb/>In any city where thou <sic>findest</sic> ease,
<lb/>contentment, and no more to be desired,
<lb/>abide in gladness and prosperity ;
<lb/>stint not thy soul one moment of delight.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName>, rejoicing at his words,
<lb/>struck up the pipes and drums, and packed the loads.
<lb/>A host accompanied him on the way
<lb/>with arms and treasure, signet-ring and crown.
<lb/>They fitted many litters and arranged
<lb/>the curtains for the ladies. In one litter
<lb/>the prince placed <persName>Farangis</persName> and, having loaded
<lb/>the baggage-train, led forth the company.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.616"/>
<lb/>They went with merriment toward <placeName>Khutan</placeName> 
<lb/>with all the famous men escorting them,



<pb n="278"/>

<lb/>because <persName>Piran</persName>, that general favourite,
<lb/>was of that state, and <persName>Siyawush</persName> had promised
<lb/>to spend a month with him. The days were passed
<lb/>in banqueting or in the hunting-field
<lb/>until the month was ended; then there rose
<lb/>the din of drum at cock-crow, and the prince
<lb/>went to his realm, preceded by <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>and followed by his troops. The news got wind,
<lb/>and all the nobles sought their overlord.
<lb/>They set forth from their homes with joyful hearts,
<lb/>and, as the custom was, bedecked the land,
<lb/>and there was such a <sic>bruit</sic> within that realm
<lb/>that thou hadst said: <q>The earth is raised to heaven.</q>
<lb/>Such were the din and blast of <sic>clarions</sic>
<lb/>that thou hadst said: <q>All hearts leap from their seats.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They found one day a cultivated tract:
<lb/>it was a goodly and well favoured site,
<lb/>on one side mountains, on another sea.
<lb/>Upon a third side was a hunting-ground,
<lb/>secluded, full of trees and rivulets—
<lb/>a place to make the old heart young again.
<lb/>Then to <persName>Piran</persName> spake <persName>Siyawush</persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>See what a noble site these fields afford :
<lb/>here will I fashion me a goodly seat
<lb/>to be my heart’s delight, a spacious city

<lb/>I will exalt the buildings to the moon,
<lb/>and make them worthy of the crown and throne.</q>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>O thou of goodly <sic>rede</sic>!
<lb/>Accomplish all that thy heart <sic>purposeth</sic>.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.617"/>

<lb/>If thou shalt bid, according to thy plans

<lb/>And <persName>Siyawush</persName> rejoined: <q>O <sic>blesséd</sic> one

<pb n="279"/>

<lb/>thou bring’st the tree of greatness into fruit.
<lb/>Thine are my weal and wealth ; I notice first

<lb/>Praise be to Him by Whom the world was wrought,

<lb/>Praise to the Prophet, and to those who bore

<lb/>and since the righteous flourish here no more
<lb/>speak not of taking this world for thy rest.

<lb/>Where are the heads and crowns of kings of kings ?

<lb/>Where are the doctors and the scientists ?

<lb/>Where are the labour-bearing <sic>annalists</sic> ?

<lb/>Where are the modest fair who charmed the sight,

<lb/>Where is the nestling of the mountain-height,

<lb/>Where he that touched the cloud-rack with his head,
<lb/>and whither is the lion-hunter gone ?

<lb/>They have but bricks and dust to form their bed,
<lb/>and he that sowed good seed is blest alone.

<lb/>From dust we come and shall return to dust,

<lb/>and all is dread, distraction, and distrust.

<pb n="280"/>

<lb/>the world will outlast thee ; its mysteries
<lb/>how wilt thou ken? 'Tis full of instances;
<lb/>shall we ignore them? Six and sixty years
<lb/>hast thou been scheming: turn thy face away
<lb/>from toil and emulation. Thy <sic>compeers</sic>
<lb/>left thee in multitudes while thou didst stay
<lb/>a greedy hand upon the world to lay,
<lb/>and shalt thou not at last be e’en as they ?
<lb/>List to the story of a bygone day.
<lb/>Since earth is void of those illustrious men
<lb/>why should ambition’s crown be sought by thee ?
<lb/>In their days justice ruled the world, and then
<lb/>earth flourished under their supremacy.
<lb/>So listen to the tale that I shall tell

<lb/>because the world hath not in any part
<lb/>another place so grateful to the heart
<lb/>as that which <persName>Siyawush</persName> built up of yore,
<lb/>and no small travail in its structure bore.

<lb/>If only one man harnessed for the fray

<lb/>The hills are stocked with game, the plains with deer.
<lb/>Once having seen it thou wilt tarry here,
<lb/>and in thy rambles o’er the higher ground
<lb/>will pheasants, peacocks, partridges be found.
<lb/>No winter’s frosts to summer’s heats succeed,
<lb/>there is no lack of food, repose, or mirth,
<lb/>thou wilt not see a single invalid ;
<lb/>in short it is a paradise on earth.
<lb/>The water here is wholesome, clear, and bright,
<lb/>the whole <sic>champaign</sic> in vernal garb is <sic>dight</sic>.
<lb/>Its length and breadth have thirty leagues extent
<lb/>according to the Persian measurement,
<lb/>and one league and a half in altitude:
<lb/>'Twould weary any one to scale the height,
<lb/>and when the place is from the summit viewed
<lb/>none ever saw a scene more exquisite.
<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> had visited the place
<lb/>he chose it out of all <corr><placeName>Turan</placeName></corr> to bear

<lb/>The prince endured much hardship <sic>thereabout</sic>
<lb/>all for the sake of greatness, throne, and crown,
<lb/>and made himself in that delightful spot

<lb/>his heart was full of pain, his eyes shed tears;

<lb/>Thou wilt prove just and true, but heaven’s purpose
<lb/>may not be thwarted. By a <sic>slanderer</sic>’s words,
<lb/>and evil fate, my blameless head will suffer.
<lb/><placeName>Iran</placeName> will be in conflict with <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>revenge will make life wretched, and the earth

<lb/>Thus hath the Almighty written in the sky
<lb/>by Whose decree seed sown will bear its fruit. . . .
<lb/>Come, let us give ourselves to joy and feast:
<lb/>when it is time for us to pass we pass.
<lb/>Why set thy heart upon this Wayside Inn ?
<lb/>Why toy with treasure? Why complain of toil?
<lb/>Our wealth will be another’s. Why should one,

<lb/>Whenas <persName>Piran</persName> had heard and taken thought
<lb/>his heart was filled with trouble at these words.
<lb/>He said: <q>I have brought evil on myself

<lb/>and scattered through the world the seeds of feud.
<lb/>I drew him to <placeName>Turan</placeName> by mine own efforts,

<lb/>and gave to him a province, crown, and wealth,

</p><p>
<lb/>And then his loving heart suggested this :—

<lb/>He surely must be thinking of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> with these words <sic>solaced</sic> his own heart,

<lb/>shouts rose, while drums and <sic>tymbals</sic> shook the ground,
<lb/>and troops from all sides gathered round <persName>Piran</persName>—
<lb/>a mighty army eager for the fray.
<lb/>Whenas the troops had mustered at his gate
<lb/>he bade farewell and marched, while <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>rich in dinars and goods of every kind,
<lb/>with well appointed steeds, remained behind.

<lb/>A <sic>cameleer</sic> brought from <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<lb/>in hottest haste about the time of sleep,

<lb/>to <persName>Siyawush</persName> a letter full of love,

<lb/>and <sic>blazoned</sic> like the starry sky: it ran :—
<lb/><q>Since thy departure I enjoy no pleasure,

<lb/>my thoughts permit me not a moment's peace.
<lb/>Moreover I have sought thee out a seat,

<lb/>such as thou wilt approve, within <placeName>Turan</placeName>.

<lb/>and <sic>griefless</sic> there, yet quit thy realm and bring

</p><p>
<lb/>The chieftain packed the baggage and set forth
<lb/>with all speed as the king commanded him.
<lb/>A thousand female camels with red hair
<lb/>they loaded up with various merchandise.
<lb/>He made a hundred camels carry treasures
<lb/>and <sic>drachms</sic>, while forty others bore dinars.
<lb/>Ten thousand swordsmen went along with him—
<lb/>picked horsemen from <placeName>Iran</placeName> and from <placeName>Turan</placeName> -—
<lb/>preceded by the baggage- train and litters
<lb/>with lovely ladies in their bravery.
<lb/>Of rubies and <sic>turquoises</sic> fit for kings,

<lb/>or torques and <sic>diadems</sic> inlaid with gems,

<lb/>of <sic>ambereris</sic>, of aloe-wood, and musk,

<lb/>of <sic>spicery</sic>, brocade, and silken cushions,

<lb/>from <placeName>Pars</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName> and <placeName>Misr</placeName> were thirty loads.

<lb/>The leader and his noble retinue

<lb/>proceeded till they came to blithe <placeName>Bahar</placeName>.

<lb/>When he arrived he pointed out a site

<lb/>two leagues in length and breadth. Thereon he built

<lb/>a city famous for its rosaries,

<lb/>its lofty palaces, and orchard-grounds.

<lb/>He <sic>limned</sic> within the hall full many a picture

<lb/>of kings, of battle, and of banqueting,

<lb/>and painted there <persName>Kaus</persName> with mace and <sic>armlets</sic>,

<lb/>crowned on his throne, with elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<lb/>with <persName>Zal</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and all that company.

<lb/>Elsewhere he <sic>limned</sic> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, his army,

<lb/>piran, and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> the vengeful one.

<lb/>That pleasant city was the talk of all

<lb/>At every corner was a cupola,

<head>How <persName>Piran</persName> visited <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Now when <persName>Piran</persName> returned from <placeName>Hind</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>all men were talking of the glorious city,
<lb/>for, founded on the auspicious day of Ard,
<lb/><placeName>Siyawushgird</placeName> was famed throughout <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>He heard of palace, orchard, garden, hall,
<lb/>plain, <sic>streamlet</sic>, hill, and dale, and longed to see
<lb/>what <persName>Siyawush</persName> had done with that fine site.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> took with him all his retinue—
<lb/>a thousand wise and valiant warriors—
<lb/>men fit to share with him in the rejoicings.
<lb/>On his approach the prince went with the host
<lb/>to welcome him. <persName>Piran</persName> on catching sight
<lb/>of <persName>Siyawush</persName> alighted, as did <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>who clasped him closely. Coming to the city
<lb/>they went around what <sic>erst</sic> had been a thorn-brake,
<lb/>but then lamp-bright with palace, hall, and pleasance.
<lb/>The chief <persName>Piran</persName> went everywhere, invoked
<lb/>full many a blessing om the prince, and said :—
<lb/><q>If <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and royal height and wisdom too
<lb/>were not thine own in this thine undertaking
<lb/>how could results like these have been achieved ?
<lb/>Be this thy monument among the brave
<lb/>and noble till the Resurrection-day,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.627"/>
<lb/>and may thy sons and sons' sons live rejoicing— 
<lb/>world-lords triumphant and magnanimous.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> surveyed part of that <sic>jocund</sic> city,
<lb/>then reached the hall and grounds of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and in high spirits and ambitious hopes

<pb n="288"/>

<lb/>proceeded to the home of <persName>Farangis</persName>.

<lb/>The daughter of the king met, greeted him,
<lb/>and proffered him a <sic>handsel</sic> of dinars.

<lb/>When, seated on the throne, he looked around,
<lb/>and saw the crowds of servants standing by,
<lb/>he uttered many words of thankfulness,

<lb/>and praised the Maker; then they fell to feasting
<lb/>with wine, cup-bearers, meats, and <sic>minstrelsy</sic>,
<lb/>and thus they passed a <sic>sennight</sic> wine in hand,
<lb/>now blithe and joyous-hearted, now bemused.
<lb/>On the eighth day <persName>Piran</persName> produced the presents
<lb/>brought from abroad, and other fitting gifts
<lb/>of rubies, royal jewelry, dinars,

<lb/>brocade, crowns all inlaid with precious stones,
<lb/>and steeds with golden furniture, the saddles
<lb/>of poplar-wood, their <sic>pummels</sic> leopard-skin.
<lb/>He gave a coronet to <persName>Farangis</persName>,

<lb/>with earrings, bracelets, and a jewelled torque,
<lb/>then went upon his way toward <placeName>Khutan</placeName>

<lb/>in order to attend his sovereign.
</p><p>
<lb/>On reaching home he spake thus to <persName>Gulshahr</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Whoe’er hath seen not <sic>jocund</sic> Paradise,
<lb/>and known what things <rs type="divinity">Rizwan</rs><ref target="n.288.1"/> hath planted there,
<lb/>should see this splendid place, this paradise

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.628"/>
<lb/>the wise and glorious, <sic>sitteth</sic> like the sun
<lb/>inside the palace of the blest <rs type="divinity">Surush</rs>.

<lb/>Allow thyself the pleasure of a visit ; -

<lb/>the lord is <sic>goodlier</sic> than his city; thou
<lb/>wouldst say: <q>He <sic>lighteth</sic> up the Occident!</q> -
<lb/>see <persName>Farangis</persName>—all loveliness and lustre,

<lb/>as '<sic>twere</sic> a two weeks' moon beside the sun.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Swift as a bark that <sic>speedeth</sic> o’er the sea
<lb/>he went thence to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, and told
<lb/>what he had done, what tribute he had brought,

<note xml:id="n.288.1">See p. 39, note.</note>

<pb n="289"/>

<lb/>how he had battled in the land of <placeName>Hind</placeName>,
<lb/>and laid ill-doers' heads upon the dust.
<lb/>The monarch asked how <persName>Siyawush</persName> had prospered,
<lb/>and of his city, province, crown, and throne.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied : <q> Whoever shall behold
<lb/>the <sic>springtide</sic>-gaiety of Paradise
<lb/>may in good sooth mistake this place for that,
<lb/>and this illustrious monarch for the sun.
<lb/>I saw a city such that none will see
<lb/>its like on earth in <placeName>Chin</placeName> or in <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>What with its wealth of gardens, halls, and streams,
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>There wisdom mixed with mind !</q>
<lb/>one must dismiss fault-finding where is naught
<lb/>to blame. When from afar I saw the palace
<lb/>of <persName>Farangis</persName> 'twas like a hoard of jewels
<lb/>as bright as light. If now <rs type="divinity">Surush</rs> should come
<lb/>from Paradise he would not have the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,
<lb/>the majesty, the common sense, the splendour,
<lb/>and ordered <sic>usance</sic> of thy son-in-law,

<lb/>Both realms too rest from strife and stir, like men

<lb/>The monarch gladdened at the words on hearing
<lb/>that this his Bough of promise was in bearing.

<lb/>as well as jewelled thrones, brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,

<head>The Birth of Farad the Son of <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>At that time came to <persName>Siyawush</persName> like wind

<lb/>a cavalier who brought good tidings, saying :—
<lb/><q>The daughter of the captain of the host

<lb/>hath borne a babe as '<sic>twere</sic> the shining moon—
<lb/>a glorious child, whom they have named Farad,
<lb/>and when <persName>Piran</persName> at night received the news


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.631"/>
<lb/>he bade me and another cavalier :— 
<lb/><q>Go bear the joyful tidings to the prince.</q>

<lb/>the mother also of the precious babe—

<lb/><persName>Jarira</persName>, chief among the high-born dames—
<lb/>commanded from her couch the slaves to smear
<lb/>the infant’s hand with saffron, and to take

<lb/>the impression on this letter’s back, and said :—
<lb/><q> Bear this to <persName>Siyawush</persName>, whose wish is granted,
<lb/>and tell him : <q>Stricken though I be in years,
<lb/>yet notwithstanding God hath made me glad.</q></q></q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> thus answered: <q>May this babe

<lb/>And gave the messenger so many <sic>drachms</sic>

<lb/><q> <persName>Piran</persName> to-day is equal to a king.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They sought the house of <persName>Farangis</persName> with joy
<lb/>and told her those glad tidings. <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>beheld her sitting on her ivory throne,

<lb/>a crown set with turquoise was on her head,
<lb/>while many slaves with golden caps were standing
<lb/>with moon-like cheeks in presence of the Moon.

<pb n="292"/>

<lb/>she came down from her throne and, greeting him,
<lb/>inquired about his <sic>longsome</sic> journey’s toil ;

<lb/>and thus he thought: <q>Let but a year pass thus

</p><p>

<lb/>He writhed but hid his feelings, and exclaimed

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> played at Polo</head>
<p>

<lb/>Now when the bright sun made the distance clear,

<lb/>and showed its face from heaven to all the land,

<lb/>the prince went from his palace to the Ground

<lb/>to play at polo. <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> came up

<lb/>and drove the ball, which <persName>Siyawush</persName> pursued

<lb/>and caught it fairly with the polo-stick,

<lb/>while his opponent only found the dust.

<lb/>The ball struck by the prince was seen no more:

<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>The sky hath drawn it up!</q>

<lb/>Then to his eager followers he said:

<lb/><q>I leave the ball and sticks and Ground to you.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Whenas the warriors came upon the Ground

<lb/>the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> in the tussle took the ball,

<lb/>while <persName>Siyawush</persName> rejoiced at their success,

<lb/>and looked as '<sic>twere</sic> a noble cypress-tree.

<lb/>He bade a golden throne be set and contests

<lb/>with javelins to take place, both princes sitting

<lb/>upon the throne to watch the combatants.

<pb n="293"/>

<lb/>the cavaliers rushed on the Ground like dust
<lb/>and, dart in- hand, began to strive for honour.
<lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> spake thus to <persName>Siyawush</persName> :—
<lb/><q>O king renowned, the Memory of kings!
<lb/>Thy prowess is still greater than thy birth:
<lb/>vouchsafe to let the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> witness it :

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.633"/>
<lb/>display before them just for once what thou 
<lb/>can’st do in javelin-play and archery.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The prince, who laid his hand upon his breast
<lb/>at this, arose and mounted on his horse.
<lb/>They bound together coats of mail five thick—
<lb/>coats any one of which would tire a man—
<lb/>and set them up at one end of the Ground,
<lb/>while all the troops stood looking. Siyd4wush
<lb/>took up a royal spear <sic>wherewith</sic> his father
<lb/>fought in <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> and slaughtered lions.
<lb/>He went upon the Ground, this spear in hand,
<lb/>and plied his reins like some mad elephant.
<lb/>He pierced the coats of mail and bore them off,
<lb/>the links and joints alike had given way.
<lb/>The charge thus made he raised his spear erect
<lb/>and flung the coats of mail about at will.
<lb/>Then valiant <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> and other horsemen
<lb/>went on the Ground with their long javelins,
<lb/>and many gathered round those coats of mail,
<lb/>but found not one whose fastenings had not yielded.
<lb/>The prince then called for four shields of <placeName>Gilan</placeName>,
<lb/>with two <sic>cuirasses</sic> also of bright steel,
<lb/>and likewise for his bow and poplar shafts.
<lb/>With six thrust through his belt and three in hand
<lb/>he set another on his bow and gripped
<lb/>his saddle firmly. Then in sight of all
<lb/>he shot the ten shafts, piercing every time
<lb/>the shields and both <sic>cuirasses</sic>. Old and young
<lb/>applauded and invoked the name of God.
<lb/><q>Thou hast, O prince!</q> said <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> to him,

<pb n="294"/>

<lb/><q>No equal in <placeName>Iran</placeName> or in <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>Come now! Let us two go upon the Ground
<lb/>before this company, there let us grasp
<lb/>each other’s leathern belt as warriors
<lb/>would do in battle. I have not a peer
<lb/>among the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>, thou wilt see few steeds


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.634"/>

<lb/>like mine, and thou in the [<sic>rénian</sic> host
<lb/>art matchless both in prowess and in stature.
<lb/>If I shall take thee from thy charger’s back,
<lb/>and throw thee to the ground, acknowledge me
<lb/>superior both in prowess and in might,
<lb/>while if thou <sic>layest</sic> me upon the earth
<lb/>I wheel no more upon the battlefield.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Siyawush</persName> made answer: <q>Speak not thus,
<lb/>thou art a prince, a Lion of the fray ;
<lb/>besides thy charger is a king to mine,
<lb/>thy helmet is <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs> to me.
<lb/>Make choice of some one else out of <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>to strive with me, but not by way of fight.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>: <q>O seeker of renown!
<lb/>No harm will come of pastime such as this.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Siyawush</persName> replied: <q>It is not well:
<lb/>I <sic>cannot</sic> fight thee. Two opposed in sport
<lb/>fight on in earnest; anger <sic>filleth</sic> them
<lb/>although they smile. Thou art the monarch’s brother,
<lb/>and tread’st the moon beneath thy horse’s hoofs;
<lb/>I will perform thy bidding but not break
<lb/>our good relations by an act like this.
<lb/>Call from thy friends some Lion of the fray,
<lb/>let him be mounted on this swift-paced steed,
<lb/>and if thou art resolved that I should fight,
<lb/>and lay the heads of proud ones in the dust,
<lb/>I will endeavour not to be disgraced
<lb/>before thy presence, O illustrious prince!</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Ambitious <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> was flattered, smiled,
<lb/>and thus addressed the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>: <q>Noble men!

<pb n="295"/>

<lb/>who is there fain to make his mark on earth ?
<lb/>Who will be matched with <persName>Siyawush</persName> and lay
<lb/>the chief of all the nobles in the dust!</q>

<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> heard him and their lips were locked.
<lb/>At length <persName>Gurwi</persName> the son of <persName>Zira</persName> said :—
<lb/><q>I am prepared to fight if <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>hath no antagonist.</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.635"/><p>
<lb/>The prince’s face 

<lb/>was full of frowns and sternness at the words,
<lb/>but <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> said unto him: <q>O prince!
<lb/>No warrior in our host can match <persName>Gurwi</persName>.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName>: <q>I hold it but a trifle
<lb/>to fight with any noble but thyself:
<lb/>two warriors should be chosen out of these
<lb/>to strive with me upon the battlefield.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>There was another noble <sic>hight</sic> <persName>Damur</persName>,
<lb/>who had no equal in <placeName>Turan</placeName> in strength.
<lb/>He, when he heard the words of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>came and made ready swift as smoke for fight.
<lb/>They wheeled about, and <persName>Siyawush</persName> began
<lb/>by snatching at the girdle of <persName>Gurwi</persName>,
<lb/>and holding by the buckle lifted him
<lb/>and flung him on the plain, but used no mace
<lb/>or lasso. Then he turned upon <persName>Damur</persName>
<lb/>and, catching him about the neck and body
<lb/>in firm embrace, unhorsed him with such ease
<lb/>that all the chiefs were lost in wonderment.
<lb/>The prince thus bore him safe to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> ;
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>He <sic>carrieth</sic> a bird!</q>
<lb/>Then, having lighted down and disengaged,
<lb/>he sat down laughing on the golden throne ;
<lb/>but <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> was <sic>wroth</sic> at that exploit ;
<lb/>his heart was sullen and his cheek was pale.
</p><p>
<lb/>They <sic>hied</sic> them homeward from their golden seats,
<lb/><q>Raised,</q> thou hadst said, <q>o’er <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> in the ascendant,</q>

<lb/>They sat and talked in private. <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>

<lb/>said to his brother: <q><persName>Siyawush</persName>, O king!

<lb/>Hath wholly changed, the envoys of <persName>Kaus</persName>

<pb n="297"/>

<lb/>come often secretly, he <sic>correspondeth</sic>
<lb/>with <placeName>Rum</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>, and <sic>drinketh</sic> to his father.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.637"/>
<lb/>Moreover he hath gathered many troops, 
<lb/>and soon will vex the king’s soul. Had not <persName>Tur</persName>
<lb/>become so fierce he had not wronged <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>but now our hearts resemble fire and water
<lb/>opposed; thou <sic>wouldest</sic>, but in vain, unite them,
<lb/>and keep the tempest hidden out of sight.
<lb/>Had I withheld this trouble from thy knowledge
<lb/>I should have <sic>smirched</sic> my name before the world.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The king was grieved and said to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> :—
<lb/><q>The bond of blood between us <sic>moveth</sic> thee.
<lb/>We will take counsel with ourself three days
<lb/>for more assurance; if the case be clear
<lb/>it shall be thy part to undo the coil.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The fourth day <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> appeared at court
<lb/>with helmet on and tightly girded loins.
<lb/>The monarch called him to an interview,
<lb/>talked much about the case of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>O thou memorial of <persName>Pashang</persName> !
<lb/>Whom have I in the world at hand but thee ?
<lb/>I must disclose the secret of my mind;
<lb/>observe what thoughts occur to thine. My heart
<lb/>was troubled at that evil dream, my brain
<lb/>affected somewhat, yet I kept from war,
<lb/>and <persName>Siyawush</persName> for his part hurt me not.
<lb/>When he <sic>farewelled</sic> the throne of might he made
<lb/>my love the weft across his wisdom’s warp.
<lb/>He was obedient and I used him well.
<lb/>I gave to him a province and my treasure,
<lb/>but kept my griefs and sorrows for mine own.
<lb/>I bound him to me by the ties of blood,
<lb/>foregoing thoughts of vengeance on <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.638"/>
<lb/>and did not grudge my treasures or my child, 
<lb/>but trusted him with both my precious Eyes,
<lb/>now, after all these pains and benefits,

<pb n="298"/>

<lb/>and sacrifice of province, crown, and wealth,

<lb/>for me to purpose ill to <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>would raise no little <sic>outery</sic>. If I do

<lb/>an injury however slight to him

<lb/>the mighty men will cry out shame on me,

<lb/>and I shall be a butt for every one.

<lb/>Of beasts the lion hath the sharpest teeth,

<lb/>his heart is not afraid of <sic>scimitars</sic>,

<lb/>and if a whelp of his shall be aggrieved

<lb/>he will lay all the meadow desolate ;

<lb/>moreover if we persecute the guiltless

<lb/>how shall the Judge of sun and moon approve ?

<lb/>I know none else that I can take to me,

<lb/>yet now I will dismiss him to his father.

<lb/>So, if he <sic>seeketh</sic> throne and signet-ring,

<lb/>he will not make our coasts the scene of strife.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> : <q>O king! treat not so lightly

<lb/>this grave affair. If he <sic>departeth</sic> home

<lb/>he will bring desolation on our coasts,

<lb/>for when an alien is made a kinsman

<lb/>he <sic>learneth</sic> all thy secrets great and small.

<lb/>A sage once spake a proverb as to this :—

<lb/><q>Domestic storms that burst externally

<lb/>will prove but travail and distress to thee,

<lb/>and dissipate wealth, fame, and family.</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.639"/>
<lb/>dost thou not know that he who <sic>reareth</sic> leopards

<lb/>will get no recompense but pain and strife ?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, when he had mused awhile

<lb/>and thought that <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> had spoken rightly,

<lb/>Repenting of his own advice and conduct,

<lb/>and owning that his policy had failed,

<lb/>thus answered <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>: <q>From this affair

<lb/>I see no good appear in any way.

<lb/>Let us be patient till the turning sky

<lb/>shall make its aspects known. In everything

<lb/>delay is better than <sic>precipitance</sic> ;

<pb n="299"/>

<lb/>wait till the sun hath shone on this awhile ;
<lb/>I shall discern God’s purpose, and to whom
<lb/>the bright cheek of revolving heaven is turned,
<lb/>and then if I recall him to the court
<lb/>I shall discover what his secret is.
<lb/>All will no doubt be clear in course of time,
<lb/>and if his villainy be manifest,
<lb/>so that my heart must needs be pitiless,
<lb/>no one will blame me afterward, for naught
<lb/>but evil fitly <sic>recompenseth</sic> evil.</q> ~


</p><p>

<lb/>Then vengeful <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>: <q> Discerning king,
<lb/>whose words are righteous! <persName>Siyawush</persName> <sic>possesseth</sic>
<lb/>grace, stature, <sic>maces</sic>, swords, and god-like hands;
<lb/>he will not come to court without a host,
<lb/>but make both sun and moon turn dark to thee.
<lb/>He is much changed, his crown is raised to heaven,
<lb/>and <persName>Farangis</persName> thou wouldst not recognize,
<lb/>but say: <q>This world can give her nothing more.</q>
<lb/>thy troops will all go over to his side,
<lb/>and when there is no flock there is no shepherd.
<lb/>An army having seen a king like him,
<lb/>so generous, so beaming, and so wise,
<lb/>thenceforth would never have thee for their king ;
<lb/>the <rs type="heavenlybody">Ram</rs> would be his throne and thine the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Fish</rs>.
<lb/>Moreover wilt thou call on him to quit
<lb/>the noble city and the prosperous seat

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.640"/>
<lb/>that he hath built, and bid him: <q>Be my slave, 
<lb/>content with meanness and obscurity ?</q>
<lb/>none <sic>seeth</sic> lions couch with elephants,
<lb/>or flames upon the surface of a stream.
<lb/>If one should take a lion’s whelp <sic>unsuckled</sic>
<lb/>as yet, should bring it up on milk and sugar,
<lb/>and nurse it on his bosom constantly,
<lb/>it will revert to nature when full-grown
<lb/>and fear no furious elephant’s assault.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch’s heart was straitened at his words ;

<pb n="300"/>

<lb/>he grew despondent, anxious, and distressed,
<lb/>but judged it best to pause, for prudent men
<lb/>win in the end, while those of windy pate
<lb/>obtain no praise. A wise man spake this saw :—

</p><p>
<lb/><q>A tempest that hath not been unforeseen
<lb/>thou <sic>mayst</sic> encounter with untroubled mien,
<lb/>while Feather-brains will be in evil plight
<lb/>albeit cypress-tall and men of might.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Unrest and talk went on; their hearts were full
<lb/>of vengeance for the wrongs of ancient days,
<lb/>for ever and anon came <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>—

<lb/>the villain full of malice—to the king,
<lb/>concocting lying tales of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>and stirring the Turanian monarch’s heart,
<lb/>until he was possessed by care and vengeance.
<lb/>One day the king in private conference

<lb/>with <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> declared his purposes,

<lb/>and said: <q>Thou must go hence. Hold intercourse
<lb/>with <persName>Siyawush</persName> for long, then speak him fairly
<lb/>from me, and say: <q>Thou in thy happy home
<lb/>hast no desire to look on any one ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.641"/>
<lb/>but my heart <sic>resteth</sic> not for love of thee.
<lb/>Arise! Come hither, thou and <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/>awhile, because we yearn to look upon thee,
<lb/>with thy shrewd mind so full of excellence.
<lb/>We too have game upon our hills, we too
<lb/>quaff wine and milk in cups of emerald.

<lb/>Thus let us pass a season and be glad,

<lb/>and, when thou longest for thy prosperous city,
<lb/>go thou with singing and with happiness.
<lb/>Why are the wine and cup denied to us ?
<lb/>Think not about thy throne of majesty,

<lb/>but <sic>straitly</sic> gird thy loins and come to me.</q></q>

<head>How <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> returned to <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>The crafty, vengeful <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> made ready.
<lb/>When he drew near <persName>Siyawush</persName> he bade
<lb/>a fluent speaker: <q>Go to <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>and say: <q>Famed son of an aspiring sire!
<lb/>By our king’s life and head, and by the life,
<lb/>the head, and royal crown of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>leave not thy throne to meet me on the way,
<lb/>because thou art so great in dignity,
<lb/>in fortune, <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, crown, throne, and lineage,
<lb/>that every wind should have to gird its loins
<lb/>to make thee quit that royal dwelling-place.</q></q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The messenger approaching kissed the ground
<lb/>and told the words of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>; the heart
<lb/>of <persName>Siyawush</persName> was pained, he sat and mused
<lb/>awhile, then said: <q> Here is some mystery !
<lb/>I know not what my good friend <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>hath said about me to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>When <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> arrived the prince went out
<lb/>afoot to him, asked of the king’s affairs,
<lb/>of throne and crown and host, and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.642"/>
<lb/>then gave the message which made <persName>Siyawush</persName> 
<lb/>rejoice, and thus he said: <q>For his dear sake
<lb/>I would not turn away from swords of steel.
<lb/>Lo! I will bind my girdle on to go,
<lb/>and link my rein to thine; but we will tarry
<lb/>within this pleasance <sic>arabesqued</sic> with gold
<lb/>three days and hold a revel, for this world
<lb/>is fleeting by in pain and toil. Alas
<lb/>for him whose little life is passed in sorrow!</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Revengeful <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> writhed when he heard
<lb/>the prudent prince’s words: <q>If <persName>Siyawush</persName>,</q>
<lb/>He thought, <q><sic>departeth</sic> with me to the king,

<pb n="302"/>

<lb/>with his astuteness and his lion-strength
<lb/>the prince will trample on my bow, my words
<lb/>will tarnish, and the king will deem my plan
<lb/>a fraud; I must devise a scheme to urge
<lb/>the heart of <persName>Siyawush</persName> to evil courses.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He fixed an earnest gaze on <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>in silence, while his eyes shed tears of gall
<lb/>to further his intent. The prince beheld
<lb/>those swimming eyes as of one greatly moved,
<lb/>and gently said: <q>My brother! what is this?
<lb/>Is it a nameless grief, or hath the king
<lb/>by his unkindness caused thy tears to flow ?
<lb/>Lo! I will go along with thee and fight
<lb/>thy battle with the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>will find out why he <sic>useth</sic> thee so ill,
<lb/>and <sic>treateth</sic> thee as his inferior,
<lb/>while if it is an open enemy
<lb/>that <sic>causeth</sic> thee insufferable grief
<lb/>and trouble, lo! I am thy friend in all,
<lb/>and will provide thee with the means to fight.
<lb/>But if the royal favour is <sic>bedimmed</sic>,
<lb/>not by thy fault but through some <sic>slanderer</sic>’s lies,
<lb/>or one hath ousted thee, confide in me,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.643"/>
<lb/>that I may make all well, assuage thy griefs,
<lb/>and purge the monarch of his faults herein.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> replied : <q>O man of fame!

<lb/>It is no question with me of the king,

<lb/>nor am I troubled by a foe. My courage

<lb/>and wealth dispense with schemes. I mused on questions

<lb/>of race, and called to mind true tales of old;

<lb/>the wrong began with <persName>Tur</persName> who lost the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,

<lb/>and made feud with <persName>Iraj</persName>, who did not brawl.

<lb/>Beneath <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> and <persName>Minuchihr</persName>

<lb/><placeName>Turan</placeName> hath been like water and <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>like fire ; they mingled not but broke away

<pb n="303"/>

<lb/>from wisdom’s bonds; <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> is worse
<lb/>than <persName>Tur</persName>; this wild bull still is in his hide.
<lb/>In truth thou <sic>knowest</sic> not his evil moods,
<lb/>but wait until a little time hath passed.
<lb/>First judge him by the guiltless <persName>Ighriras</persName>,
<lb/>his brother in full blood, whom he destroyed
<lb/>with his own hand in very wantonness,
<lb/>while afterward full many a famous man
<lb/>was slaughtered by him for no fault at all.
<lb/>My chief anxiety is now for thee,
<lb/>for thou art shrewd of heart and stout of frame,
<lb/>and, since thou <sic>camest</sic> to our land, hast done
<lb/>no wrong to any, but adorned the world
<lb/>with wisdom, seeking right and manliness.
<lb/>Malignant <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>, who <sic>parteth</sic> hearts,
<lb/>hath seared the king’s through thee, and it is all

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.644"/>
<lb/>revenge and grief at thee! God’s will I know not, 
<lb/>but thou dost know me as thy friend, thy partner
<lb/>in weal and woe, and thou must not suspect
<lb/>hereafter that I knew of all this coil.
<lb/>I therefore tell thee of the monarch’s case,
<lb/>which it had been a fault in me to hide.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> : <q>Have no concern <sic>hereat</sic>,
<lb/>the Maker of the world is mine ally ;
<lb/>I did hope otherwise than that the king
<lb/>would turn my day to night; had he been <sic>wroth</sic>
<lb/>with me he had not raised me over others,
<lb/>or given me a province, crown, and throne,
<lb/>domain, his daughter, treasure, and a host.
<lb/>Now will I go with thee to court and make
<lb/>his dim moon <sic>shiné</sic> again. Where’er truth <sic>shineth</sic>
<lb/>the light of falsehood <sic>waneth</sic>. I will show him
<lb/>this heart of mine, a heart that doth outshine
<lb/>the sun in heaven. Be happy then, reject
<lb/>suspicion, for whoever <sic>suffereth</sic>
<lb/>that dragon’s breath <sic>departeth</sic> from God’s way.</q></p>

<pb n="304"/>
<p>
<lb/>But <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> made answer: <q>My dear friend!
<lb/>He is much changed. So long as heaven shall turn
<lb/>he will be harsh and wear a frowning face.

<lb/>Not e’en the wisest <sic>knoweth</sic> of the wiles

<lb/>that lift on his horizon. Thou thyself,

<lb/>with all thy learning and thy prudent heart,
<lb/>thy towering stature and high purposes,
<lb/>Discernest not 'twixt artifice and love:

<lb/>may no ill fortune ever come to thee!

<lb/>He dealt in charms and spells with thee, and sewed
<lb/>the eyes of wisdom up by his devices,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.645"/>
<lb/>first, when he named thee son-in-law, thy joy
<lb/>was ill advised. Next when he sent thee forth
<lb/>he made a feast for thee, and called his lords,

<lb/>in hope that thou wouldst take some liberty,
<lb/>and give occasion to the world to talk.

<lb/>Besides thou art not closer unto him

<lb/>by any ties than prudent <persName>Ighriras</persName>,

<lb/>whom he cut down, and filled the nobles' hearts
<lb/>with terror. Since his purposes are clear,
<lb/>accept the fact; trust not the ties of blood.

<lb/>Now like the shining sun have I displayed

<lb/>my thoughts, my trade, and wit. Thou hast rejected
<lb/>a father in <placeName>Iran</placeName>, and in <placeName>Turan</placeName>

<lb/>hast <sic>builded</sic> cities, yielding to the words

<lb/>and sharing in the troubles of the king.

<lb/>It is an ill tree that thy hand hath planted,
<lb/>with poisonous fruit and leaves of <sic>colocynth</sic>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He spake <sic>deceitfully</sic> with running eyes
<lb/>and sighing lips, while <persName>Siyawush</persName> in tears,
<lb/>regarding him with wonder, called to mind
<lb/>his own sad fate that heaven’s love should cease,
<lb/>and that though young his life was well nigh sped.

<lb/>His heart was pained, his cheeks turned pale, he sighed

<lb/>in heaviness of soul, and said: <q>I find not
<lb/>that I deserve <sic>requital</sic> for ill done,

<pb n="305"/>

<lb/>for nobody hath heard a fault of mine

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.646"/>
<lb/>in word or deed. Good sooth if I have squandered 
<lb/>his treasure my heart is wrung at his displeasure,
<lb/>but come what may I never will transgress 
<lb/>his wishes or commands. Now let me go 
<lb/>with thee, without an escort, and discover
<lb/>the reason of the anger of the king.</q>


</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> replied: <q> Aspiring one!
<lb/>It is not well to go. No need to walk
<lb/>thus into fire, or to expose thyself
<lb/>to breakers; 'tis but rushing into danger,
<lb/>and sending smiling destiny to sleep;
<lb/>I surely shall suffice to mediate
<lb/>and fling cold water on the flames; but write
<lb/>a letter telling all things fair or foul,
<lb/>and if I find him free from vengeful thoughts,
<lb/>and in a lucid interval of good,
<lb/>I will dispatch a cavalier and make
<lb/>thy gloomy counsels bright. I trust in God,
<lb/>who <sic>knoweth</sic> all things, that <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>will turn to good and shun perverse, bad ways :
<lb/>but if I find him rash and obstinate
<lb/>I likewise will dispatch a camel-post
<lb/>in haste; then make thee ready instantly,
<lb/>illustrious monarchs and their realms are near
<lb/>at hand, it is but six score leagues to <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>and only seventeen score to <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>where all are friendly and prepared to serve thee.
<lb/>On that side too thou hast a yearning father,
<lb/>a host attached to thee, and loyal cities.
<lb/>Dispatch a lengthy letter to all parts,
<lb/>and haste to get thee ready.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>gave credence to the words of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>so much was his shrewd intellect asleep,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.647"/>
<lb/>and answered: <q>I will do as thou hast said, 



<pb n="306"/>

<lb/>and not transgress thy counsel and advice.
<lb/>Make intercession for me with the king:
<lb/>and show me the right course in everything,</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="50">
<head>The Letter of <persName>Siyawush</persName> to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>A ready scribe was called to whom the prince
<lb/>gave full instructions. First invoking God—
<lb/>the Assuager of His servant’s grief—he spake
<lb/>the praise of wisdom, blessed the king, and said :—
<lb/><q>O king victorious and fortunate !
<lb/>May time ne'er prove thine only monument.
<lb/>Thou <sic>calledst</sic> me and I rejoiced <sic>thereat</sic> :
<lb/>may thy seat be amongst the <sic>archimages</sic>.
<lb/>Moreover thou didst summon <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/>and fill her heart with love and loyalty,
<lb/>but <persName>Farangis</persName> is ailing at this present
<lb/>with weakness and the loss of appetite,
<lb/>she <sic>cannot</sic> rise and will not let me leave
<lb/>her side (I see her lying 'twixt two worlds)
<lb/>although my heart desired to look on thee,
<lb/>and thy words gave new lustre to my spirit.
<lb/>When <persName>Farangis</persName> is well she shall become
<lb/>the ransom of the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName>;
<lb/>her sufferings are also mine excuse,
<lb/>for I am privy to her pains and griefs.</q>

<lb/>He gave the letter, when it had been sealed,
<lb/>at once to evil-natured <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>who boldly made request for three fleet steeds,
<lb/>and rode without a halt both day and night.
<lb/>He traversed in three days the long, hard road
<lb/>o’er hill and vale, and on the fourth day reached
<lb/>the monarch’s court, a villain bent on ill,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.648"/>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, on seeing him thus pressed,

<pb n="307"/>

<lb/>and full of hurry, questioned him at large :—

<lb/><q>Why hast thou come in haste,</q> the <sic>voonarch</sic> said,

<lb/><q>Why didst thou make a journey of such length ?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> replied: <q> When fortune <sic>loureth</sic>,

<lb/>it is not well to put thy trust therein.

<lb/>Now <persName>Siyawush</persName> showed no regard for me,

<lb/>nor even came to meet me on the way,

<lb/>would hear no words, would not peruse thy letter,

<lb/>but set me on my knees below his throne.

<lb/>He had much correspondence with <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>and kept his city’s portals shut on us.

<lb/>What with a host from <placeName>Rum</placeName> and one from <placeName>Chin</placeName>

<lb/>there is a constant <sic>bruit</sic> within the land.

<lb/>Unless thou <sic>actest</sic> promptly thou wilt have

<lb/>naught left but wind. While thou art hesitating

<lb/>he will attack thee, and obtain both realms,

<lb/>for should he lead his army toward <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>what man would dare come forth to challenge him ?

<lb/>My purpose in forewarning thee is this

<lb/>that thou <sic>mayst</sic> suffer by no act of his.</q>

<lb/>Whenas <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had heard these words
<lb/>the feelings of old days returned to him.
<lb/>His heart grew full of fire, his head of wind,
<lb/>he could not answer <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> for wrath,
<lb/>but in his fury bade pipes, cymbals, trumpets,
<lb/>and Indian bells be sounded, and troops summoned.
<lb/>He flung away the letter all unread,
<lb/>and, through the words that wicked <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>had spoken, set another tree of feud.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.649"/><p>
<lb/>Now, while the <sic>guileful</sic> <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> was toiling

<lb/>went pale and trembling to his ladies' bower.
<lb/><q>Chief of the lion-clutch!</q> said <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/><q>Why is thy favour changed?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><q> My fair!</q> he answered,
<lb/><q>Mine honour hath been blackened in <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>I know not how to answer thee, for I
<lb/>am all confounded at the case myself;
<lb/>but, if the words of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> be true,
<lb/>my share is point and not circumference.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Farangis</persName> plucked at her tresses, rent
<lb/>with filbert-nails her cheeks of <sic>cercis</sic>-bloom,
<lb/>blood drenched her locks of musky hyacinth,
<lb/>her heart was full of fire, her face all tears,
<lb/>which fell in showers upon the silver hills.

<lb/>She bit with pearly teeth her tulip lips,

<lb/>she tore her hair out by the roots, and wept
<lb/>for what <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had said and done.

<lb/>She said to <persName>Siyawush</persName>: <q>O noble king !

<lb/>What wilt thou do? Make haste to tell me all.
<lb/>Thy father is enraged, thou <sic>durst</sic> not speak
<lb/>about <placeName>Iran</placeName>; 'tis <sic>longsome</sic> hence to <placeName>Rum</placeName>,

<lb/>and thou wouldst be ashamed to go to <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>Whom wilt thou take to be thy refuge now ?
<lb/>Thy refuge is the Lord of sun and moon.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>He answered her: <q> My good friend <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>will come with joyful tidings from the king,
<lb/>who surely will forgive through tenderness,
<lb/>and turn his vengeance into clemency.</q>

</p><p>

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> had a Dream</head>
<p>

<lb/>For three days <persName>Siyawush</persName> wept bitterly
<lb/>by reason of this treacherous turn of fate.

<pb n="309"/>

<lb/>the fourth night as the prince lay fast asleep,
<lb/>clasped to the breast of moon-faced <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/>he shuddered, woke in fright, and cried as '<sic>twere</sic>
<lb/>a maddened elephant. The fair one clung
<lb/>to him, exclaiming: <q>For love’s sake, O king!
<lb/>What <sic>aileth</sic> thee?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>When he called out they lit
<lb/>the lamps and kindled aloe-wood before him,
<lb/>and <sic>ambergris</sic>. The lady asked again :—
<lb/><q>O prudent prince! what <sic>sawest</sic> thou in sleep?</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> made answer: <q> Tell not thou
<lb/>this dream of mine to any of the folk.
<lb/>My dream was this, O <sic>silvern</sic> Cypress-tree !
<lb/>I saw a mighty river stretching far,
<lb/>and on the further bank a mount in flames;
<lb/>the river-side was held by men in mail.
<lb/>On one side was the swiftly rolling fire—
<lb/>a fire whereby <persName>Siyawush</persName> was burned.
<lb/>Here fire, there water, while <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>stood right before me with his elephants,
<lb/>he looked upon me with a <sic>louring</sic> face,
<lb/>and blew the already fiercely burning flames.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The lady answered him: <q>It <sic>bodeth</sic> well,
<lb/>unless thou <sic>slumberest</sic> for this one night.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName> assembled all his guards
<lb/>and posted them about the court and hall;
<lb/>he mounted in full armour, sword in hand,
<lb/>and sent out scouts upon the road to <placeName>Gang</placeName>.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.651"/>
<lb/>Whenas the more part of the night had passed 
<lb/>there came a scout on horseback from the waste,
<lb/>who said: <q> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> with many troops
<lb/>Appeareth in the distance, pressing forward.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then came a messenger from <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>who said: <q> Gird up thy loins to save thy life.
<lb/>My words have proved to be of no avail,
<lb/>I see black smoke although I see no fire:

<pb n="310"/>

<lb/>consider now what course thou <sic>shouldest</sic> take,

<lb/>and how thou <sic>mayest</sic> best dispose thy troops.</q>
<lb/>But <persName>Siyawush</persName>, who knew not the design,

<lb/>believed in <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>. Then <persName>Farangis</persName>

<lb/>said: <q>O wise king! take no account of us,




<lb/>but mount upon a <sic>courser</sic> fleet of foot,

<lb/>and trust not to the country of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.

<lb/>I fain would see thee in security

<lb/>abiding here, but save thyself and flee.</q>

<head>The Parting Words of <persName>Siyawush</persName> to <persName>Farangis</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>He said to <persName>Farangis</persName>: <q>That dream of mine
<lb/>hath come to pass: my glory is <sic>bedimmed</sic>.

<lb/>For me existence <sic>draweth</sic> to an end,

<lb/>the misery of bitter days hath come.

<lb/>My palace may reach <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>, yet death’s poison
<lb/>hath to be drunk; though life should be prolonged
<lb/>twelve hundred years dark dust is our last home;
<lb/>some are the food of lions, some of vultures

<lb/>or eagles. Nobody possessed of wisdom
<lb/>Expecteth any brightness from the night.

<lb/>This is the fifth month of thy pregnancy

<lb/>with our illustrious and growing babe:

<lb/>this precious Tree of thine will bring forth Fruit,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.652"/>

<lb/>a glorious monarch; name him <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>and in thy sorrowing find peace in him,

<lb/>none from the bright sun to the <sic>darksome</sic> dust,
<lb/>from gnat’s wing to the mighty elephant’s foot,
<lb/>and from the well-spring to the river <placeName>Nile</placeName>,

<lb/>can scape the justice of All-holy God.

<lb/>Turdénian soil will be my grave, and none

<lb/>will say : <q>His dust <sic>reposeth</sic> in <placeName>Iran</placeName>,</q>

<lb/>may not men call this old world new whose sky

<pb n="311"/>

<lb/>so quickly <sic>altereth</sic>? My <sic>jocund</sic> fortune

<lb/>will sleep henceforward by the king’s command.
<lb/>They will strike off this guiltless head of mine,
<lb/>and lay my diadem in my heart’s blood.

<lb/>For me no bier, shroud, grave, or weeping people,
<lb/>but like a stranger I shall lie in dust,

<lb/>a trunk beheaded by the scimitar ;

<lb/>while thee, thy head unveiled, thy body bare,
<lb/>the guards shall drag in shame along the road.
<lb/>Then will <persName>Piran</persName> the chieftain reach the court,
<lb/>plead with thy sire to spare thy blameless life,
<lb/>and bear thee to his palace in thine anguish.
<lb/>There in the house of that old, honoured man
<lb/>wilt thou bring forth illustrious <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>and there will come a saviour from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>one with his loins girt up by God’s command,
<lb/>who will convey thee and thy son in haste
<lb/>toward the <placeName>Jihun</placeName>. Thy son will have the throne,
<lb/>and rule o’er fowl and fish. A host will come


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.653"/>
<lb/>for vengeance from <placeName>Iran</placeName> and shake the world. 
<lb/>Such is the process of the fickle sky, 
<lb/>which <sic>cottoneth</sic> to no man out of love! 

<lb/>Ob! what a mighty host will don their mail
<lb/>to vindicate mine honour! Battle-shouts
<lb/>will rise, and <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> will vex the age;
<lb/>then <persName>Rustam</persName>’s <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> will trample earth, despising
‘iranian folk, and thou wilt see no vengeance
<lb/>ta’en for me till the Resurrection-day
<lb/>save by the mace and trenchant scimitar.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The noble hero turned himself to her,

<lb/>bade her farewell, and said: <q> Fair spouse! I go;
<lb/>be strengthened by my words, and think no more
<lb/>of luxury and throne.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He left the palace,
<lb/>heart-broken, pale, lamenting sore. O world 1)
<lb/>I wot not why thou <sic>nurturest</sic> men if they


<pb n="312"/>

<lb/>whom thou hast nurtured are to be thy prey !
</p><p>
<lb/>The lady tore her cheeks, plucked out her hair,
<lb/>sent two streams pouring from her eyes, and hung
<lb/>upon him as he spake the words of woe.
</p><p>
<lb/>With cheeks and eyes which ran with his heart’s blood
<lb/>he sought the stables of his <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steeds,

<lb/>and led forth from its stall night-<sic>hued</sic> <rs type="horse">Bihzad</rs>,
<lb/>which overtook the wind in days of battle.

<lb/>He groaned, he clasped its head upon his breast,
<lb/>and took the halter and the <sic>headstall</sic> off,

<lb/>long while he whispered in his charger’s ear,
<lb/>and said: <q> Be prudent, have to do with none.
<lb/>When to avenge me <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> shall come

<lb/>it is on thee that he must put the bridle,

<lb/>so now renounce the stable once for all,

<lb/>for thou shalt carry him to his revenge.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.654"/>
<lb/>Be thou his charger, trample on the world,

<lb/>and with thy hoofs sweep <sic>foemen</sic> from the earth.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He hamstrung all the other steeds and slashed
<lb/>their legs like rushes with his scimitar.

<lb/>As for the riches in the treasury,

<lb/>his palace, and rose-garden, his brocade,

<lb/>dinars, pearls, jewelry, the diadem,

<lb/>sword, belt, and helm, he burned and wasted them.

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> was taken by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>This done, he with his chiefs marched toward <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>lost in amazement at his evil fortune,

<lb/>and with his cheeks suffused by tears of blood
<lb/>fared half a league then met <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<lb/>beheld an armoured host with sword and mace,
<lb/>and, buckling up his mail, thought: <q><persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>hath told the truth, a truth too evident!</q>
</p>

<pb n="313"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now <persName>Siyawush</persName> feared for his life what time
<lb/>the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName> drew nigh. His troops
<lb/>partook his fears. The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> occupied

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.655"/>
<lb/>all hills and roads, and each host eyed the other, 
<lb/>for hate had been a stranger to their hearts.
<lb/>Through fear of <persName>Siyawush</persName> the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> horsemen
<lb/>sought not to fight but hung back cautiously.
<lb/>With things at such a pass the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> cried
<lb/>to <persName>Siyawush</persName> : <q>O monarch of the world !
<lb/>Why should they slay us with impunity
<lb/>and drag us o’er the plain? Think this no trifle
<lb/>but let them witness the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>' prowess.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName>: <q>This is not well, for we 7
<lb/>have neither room nor force to fight. To offer
<lb/>my sovereign battle would disgrace my stock.
<lb/>The turning sky is bent on my destruction,
<lb/>though guiltless, by the hands of wicked men,
<lb/>and I can make no bold attack to-day,
<lb/>for none can strive with God. What said the sage,
<lb/>that man of prudence? <q> Brave not adverse fate.</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> said <persName>Siyawush</persName> :— 
<lb/><q>O full of virtues, great and glorious king!
<lb/>Why hast thou come to battle with thy host ?
<lb/>Why wouldst thou slay me in mine innocence ?
<lb/>Thou wilt embroil the forces of two realms,
<lb/>and fill the earth and age with <sic>malisons</sic>.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Said <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> the <sic>insensate</sic>: <q>Do these words
<lb/><sic>befit</sic> thee? If thou art so innocent
<lb/>why hast thou come thus mail-clad to the king ?
<lb/>Men come not to receive their sovereigns
<lb/>with gifts of bow and mail.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>on hearing answered: <q> Villain! through thy words
<lb/>I left the right path in my heedlessness,
<lb/>thou <sic>saidst</sic>: <q>The monarch is enraged at thee!</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.656"/>
<lb/>now guiltless men in thousands will be slaughtered 

<pb n="314"/>

<lb/>through what thou <sic>saidst</sic>, but punishment will come
<lb/>at last. As thou hast sown so shalt thou reap.</q>
<lb/>Then <sic>tothe</sic> king: <q>Let not thine anger burn.
<lb/>It is no jest for thee to shed my blood,
<lb/>and wage a war against the innocent.
<lb/>Give not thyself and kingdom to the winds
<lb/>for what that miscreant <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> hath said.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>But <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> the double-dealer watched
<lb/>and, while the prince was speaking to the king,
<lb/>grew <sic>wroth</sic> and cried: <q>O king! what <sic>aileth</sic> thee?
<lb/>Why <sic>shouldst</sic> thou hold a parley with thy foe?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Now when the king had heard what <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>had spoken, and it being then broad day,
<lb/>he bade his soldiers draw their trenchant swords,
<lb/>and raise a shout like Resurrection-morn ;
<lb/>but <persName>Siyawush</persName>, still constant to his pledge,
<lb/>put not his hand to sword and javelin,
<lb/>and let not one of his companions
<lb/>advance a foot to battle with the foe.
<lb/>Malevolent and fell <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>then wrought upon that chieftain of <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>gross outrage, saying: <q> Give them to the sword,
<lb/>and float a ship in blood upon the plain.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The Iranian army was a thousand strong,
<lb/>all men of name and doughty warriors,
<lb/>who perished on the field and made the earth
<lb/>like tulips with their gore. Amid the <sic>mellay</sic>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.657"/>
<lb/>the prince fell from his sable steed, sore wounded
<lb/>by shaft and dart. Gurwf the son of <persName>Zira</persName>
<lb/>bound both his hands, as he was lying senseless,
<lb/>behind his back firm as a rock, while others
<lb/>placed on his neck a yoke. The blood ran down
<lb/>those cheeks of <sic>cercis</sic>-bloom ; he ne’er had seen
<lb/>a day like that! The executioners
<lb/>urged him and dragged him on the road afoot
<lb/>with troops around him toward <persName>Siyawush</persName>.

<pb n="315"/>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> commanded, saying: <q>Take him
<lb/>beside the road and let him be beheaded

<lb/>on some bare spot where grasses never grow,
<lb/>and pour his blood upon the burning earth.
<lb/>Let there be no delay and have no fears.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>The soldiers said: <q> What fault hast thou discerned ?
<lb/>Wilt thou not say, O king! how he hath wronged thee
<lb/>that thou <sic>shouldst</sic> steep thy hands thus in his blood ?
<lb/>Why wilt thou slay a man for whom the crown
<lb/>and ivory throne will weep with bitterness ?
<lb/>Plant not in times of happiness a tree
<lb/>whose <sic>fruitage</sic> fortune will convert to bane.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>But <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, that man of evil note,
<lb/>was in his folly on the murderers' side,
<lb/>and fain would shed the-blood of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>through dudgeon ever since the day of contest.<ref target="n.315.1"/>
<lb/>there was a warrior younger than <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>his brother and his noble peer, by name
<lb/><persName>Pilsam</persName>, a bright, accomplished youth, who reasoned
<lb/>thus with the king: <q>The <sic>fruitage</sic> of this shoot
<lb/>is pain and grief. I have heard sages say,
<lb/>and wisdom too <sic>agreeth</sic> <sic>therewithal</sic> :—
<lb/><q>How can deliberation cause regret?</q>
<lb/>and: <q>Reason is the medicine of the angry.</q> 

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.658"/>
<lb/>And: <q>Haste and ill are works of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>— 
<lb/>pain and remorse to body and to soul.</q> 
<lb/>it is not reason to behead thy subject
<lb/>so recklessly ; keep him in bonds till time
<lb/>shall give its teaching ; when the breath of wisdom
<lb/>shall breathe upon thy heart thou <sic>mayst</sic> behead him,
<lb/>but give no order now, be not in haste,
<lb/>for <sic>hastiness</sic> is rooted in regret.
<lb/>It is not fit to sever, O wise king!
<lb/>A head whose covering will be the crown;
<lb/>and if thou shalt behead a guiltless man,

<note xml:id="n.315.1">See § 47.</note>



<pb n="316"/>

<lb/>one whom <persName>Kaus</persName> and <persName>Rustam</persName> will avenge—
<lb/>the Shah’s own son whom <persName>Rustam</persName> hath brought up
<lb/>and nourished fondly—we shall see the wrong
<lb/>revenged, and thou wilt suffer for this day.
<lb/>Bethink thee of the sword with flashing blade,
<lb/>the sword whereby the world is filled with blood,
<lb/>and those famed leaders of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>whose wrath <sic>confoundeth</sic> earth, as <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>the son of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, the ravening Lion,
<lb/>whom none e’er yet saw satiate of fight ;
<lb/>that hero too and snorting Elephant,
<lb/>great <persName>Rustam</persName>, in whose eyes a host is vile,
<lb/>then will <persName>Gudarz</persName>, Gurein, <persName>Farhad</persName>, and <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>make fast the drums upon the elephants' backs,
<lb/>gird up their loins to take revenge, and fill
<lb/>the wide <sic>champaign</sic> with spearmen. I, my peers,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.659"/>
<lb/>and our best warriors <sic>cannot</sic> <sic>countervail</sic>.
<lb/>Good sooth <persName>Piran</persName> will come at dawn, the king
<lb/>will also hear what he hath got to say,
<lb/>and seeing that there is no urgency
<lb/>Dispread not such a carpet of revenge
<lb/>upon the world. Enjoin not haste herein,
<lb/>for it will be the ruin of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> was softened by these words,
<lb/>but <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> his brother had no shame,
<lb/>and said: <q>Check not thy purpose, man of wisdom !
<lb/>Because of this youth’s talk. The plain is full
<lb/>of vultures feeding on the Iranian dead,
<lb/>and if thou <sic>fearest</sic> vengeance there is cause.
<lb/>Should <persName>Siyawush</persName> cry out earth would appear
<lb/>all mace and scimitar from <placeName>Rum</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>Hath he not done thee wrong enough that thou
<lb/>Shouldst listen weakly to what others say ?
<lb/>The snake’s tail thou hast crushed and bruised its head ;

<lb/>now wilt thou deck its body with brocade ?

<pb n="317"/>

<lb/>if thou shalt spare his life I will depart
<lb/>to some retreat and perish.</q>


</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Damur</persName>
<lb/>went with <persName>Gurwi</persName>, both writhing with <sic>aftfright</sic>,
<lb/>before the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName> and said :—
<lb/><q>Mind not the blood of <persName>Siyawush</persName> so much,
<lb/>because 'tis vile to rest with all to do,
<lb/>but hearken to the words of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>the counsellor, and sweep away thy foe.
<lb/>Since thou hast laid the snare and captured him
<lb/>slay him at once, and tarnish not thy glory
<lb/>through folly. Holding him is <sic>aot</sic> enough;
<lb/>'Tis needful that we break our <sic>foemen</sic>’s hearts.
<lb/>Thou hast destroyed his troops! <rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs> how the prince

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.660"/>
<lb/>will now regard thee. Had none injured thee 
<lb/>Aforetime water could have purged this fault ;
<lb/>now policy would have him seen no more
<lb/>at large or in restraint.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The king replied :-—

<lb/><q>I have myself beheld no fault in him ;
<lb/>albeit astrologers declare that ill
<lb/>will come to me through him, and if I shed
<lb/>his blood revenge will raise dust in <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>and dim the sun. That day will daze the wise.
<lb/>Misfortune is upon me and my realm ;
<lb/>affliction, pain, and bondage are at hand,
<lb/>yet freeing him is worse than slaying him,
<lb/>though slaying him will cause me pain and anguish.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>But neither sage nor villain can make sure
<lb/>what new expedient heaven may have in store.

<lb/>girt with a bloody cord, her moon-like face
<lb/>Besmirched with blood; she came in fear and trembling,

<lb/>Why wilt thou bring me to such misery ?
<lb/>Why hast thou wrapped thy heart up in deceit ?
<lb/>Dost thou not from thy height perceive the abyss ?
<lb/>Take not a monarch’s and a guiltless head ;

<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> departed from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>he did thee homage—thee of all the world—

<lb/>She as she spoke caught sight of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/><q>O king! O brave! O chief! O sovereign!
<lb/>O lion proud of head! O man of might!
<lb/>Thou hast left home and country in <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and recognised my father as thy king,
<lb/>yet art thou <sic>haled</sic> afoot with bounden hands!
<lb/>Where are the crown and throne of high estate,
<lb/>where all the royal oaths and covenants
<lb/>that made the Sun and Moon and <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> quail ?
<lb/>Where would be Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> and his proud chiefs
<lb/>if at this moment they beheld thee thus?
<lb/>Where are the mighty <persName>Rustam</persName>, <persName>Tus</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName>,

<lb/>His heart was all a-fire against his daughter,

<lb/>he shut the eye of wisdom recklessly.

<lb/>Within the lofty palace was one chamber

<head>How <persName>Siyawush</persName> was slain by <persName>Gurwi</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> glanced at <persName>Gurwi</persName>; that villain
<lb/>turned round and going up to <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>showed no observance and humanity,
<lb/>but grasping with his hand the prince’s beard
<lb/>dragged him, O horror! vilely through the dust,
<lb/>while <persName>Siyawush</persName> thus prayed Almighty God :—
<lb/><q>O Thou that art above the change of time!
<lb/>Cause from <sic>iny</sic> seed an Offshoot to appear,
<lb/>in all men’s eyes as '<sic>twere</sic> a shining sun,
<lb/>who will avenge me of my foes, maintain
<lb/>my precedents, exhibit all achievement
<lb/>and manliness, and reinstate the world.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Pilsam</persName> came following <persName>Gurwi</persName> with tears
<lb/>of blood in anguish. <q>Fare thee well,</q> the prince
<lb/>exclaimed, <q>Be thou the woof and be the world
<lb/>thy warp. Jarewell <persName>Piran</persName> for me and say :-—
<lb/><q>The fashion of the world hath changed!</q> I hoped
<lb/>much otherwise of him, for his advice
<lb/>was like the breeze and I was like the willow.
<lb/>He told me: <q>I with five score thousand men,
<lb/>all cavaliers in mail on <sic>barded</sic> steeds,
<lb/>will be thy helper when the day shall come,

<pb n="321"/>

<lb/>will be thy pasturage at feeding-time.</q>
<lb/>now hurried on in front of <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,

<lb/>afoot thus in my shame and gloom of soul,
<lb/>I see no friend or one to wail for me.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>When he was past the city and the host
<lb/>they bore and dragged him bound upon the plain,
<lb/>and then <persName>Gurwi</persName> received from <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>
<lb/>a blue-steel dagger for the bloody deed.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.664"/>
<lb/>He dragged the prince on by the hair afoot 
<lb/>and when he came to where the mark had stood
<lb/>the day that <persName>Siyawush</persName> and <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,

<lb/>that lion-taker, had the shooting-bout,

<lb/>the son of <persName>Zira</persName>, villain that he was,

<lb/>flung to the ground the mighty Elephant,

<lb/>and showed no shame or reverence for rank,

<lb/>but set a golden basin on the ground,

<lb/>turned up the prince’s face as '<sic>twere</sic> a sheep's,
<lb/>cut off the silver Cypress' head and filled

<lb/>the bowl with blood. <persName>Gurwi</persName> took up the bowl
<lb/>and emptied it where he had been commanded.
<lb/>From that blood presently there sprang a plant,
<lb/>which I will teach thee how to recognise,

<lb/>for it is called <q>The Blood of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Now when the Sun had left the Cypress-stem,
<lb/>and when the prince’s head had fallen asleep,
(And what a sleep! For how much time hath passed
<lb/>and he hath never stirred, hath never <sic>waked</sic> !)
<lb/>a tempest with a cloud of <sic>darksome</sic> dust
<lb/>arose enveloping the sun and moon,

<lb/>and no man could discern his neighbour’s face,
<lb/>then all of them began to curse <persName>Gurwi</persName>.

</p><p>

<lb/>I turn me left and right and all around, 
<lb/>but knowledge of this world have I not found.
<lb/>One man doth much amiss but good alone
<lb/>is his, the world and fortune are his own;

<lb/>another <sic>walketh</sic> this earth righteously


<pb n="322"/>

<lb/>yet <sic>withereth</sic> away in misery.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.665"/>
<lb/>From every anxious care thy soul release,
<lb/>and let thy sorrow over this world cease,
<lb/>for 'tis a fickle thing, not ever sure,

<lb/>and will be so till time shall be no more.
<lb/>But this is certain—<sic>whatso</sic>’er thy lot

<lb/>may be in this world it <sic>abideth</sic> not.

</p><p>

<lb/>A cry rose from the halls of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>for <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> had filled the world with tumult ;
<lb/>the slaves all rent their hair, and <persName>Farangis</persName>
<lb/>plucked off and bound a long and musky tress
<lb/>around her, tore her cheeks of <sic>cercis</sic>-bloom,
<lb/>and cursed with tears and shrieks her father’s soul,
<lb/>who hearing how she wailed and cursed him, said
<lb/>to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> the villain: <q> Bring her forth,
<lb/>drag her outside the curtains by the hair,
<lb/>and tell the guards and executioners
<lb/>to take her by the tresses, strip, and beat her,
<lb/>until she <sic>casteth</sic> on Turanian soil
<lb/>the seed of vengeance, for I will not have
<lb/>a tree or bough or leaf or crown or throne
<lb/>come from his root.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then all the nobles present
<lb/>began to curse <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, and said :—
<lb/><q>From king or minister or warrior
<lb/>none e’er heard such a sentence!</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>With his cheeks

<lb/>blood-stained, his spirit seared, his face all tears,
<lb/><persName>Pilsam</persName> approached <persName>Lahhak</persName> and <persName>Farshidward</persName>.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.666"/>
<lb/><q>E'en Hell is better than <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>’s
<lb/>throne!</q> he exclaimed. <q>No rest or sleep for us
<lb/>in this land! We must hasten to <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>in sorrow and concern about the captives.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>They put the saddles on three noble steeds:
<lb/><q> They roll the earth before them,</q> thou hadst said.
<lb/>Now these three horsemen, when they reached <persName>Piran</persName>,

<pb n="323"/>

<lb/>their faces blood-stained and their souls all thorns,
<lb/>recounted to him what had come to pass,
<lb/>and how the ills of fortune had begun.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, when he had diligently heard
<lb/>their words, fell from his throne and swooned away.
<lb/>He rent his clothes, threw dust upon his head,
<lb/>plucked out the hair, and in his bitter anguish

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.667"/>
<lb/>exclaimed: <q> Alack! thou worthy of the crown ! 
<lb/>For ivory throne will never see thy like.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Lahhak</persName> said: <q>Haste! oh! haste! or greater grief
<lb/>will come, for they have carried <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/>her body all a-quiver like a, tree,

<p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> on hearing this cried out in wrath,

<lb/>brought forth ten <sic>roadsters</sic> up to warriors' weight,

<lb/>and with the brave <persName>Ruin</persName> and <persName>Farshidward</persName>

<lb/>sent up the dust forthwith.<ref target="n.323.1"/> He reached the court

<lb/>about the portal, <persName>Farangis</persName> bereft

<lb/>with sword in hand, and all the court in uproar;

<lb/>all hearts were full of grief, all eyes of tears,

<lb/>all tongues of curses on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.

<lb/>The populace—men, women, and young children—
<lb/>were talking at the palace-gate and saying :—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.668"/>
<lb/><q>It were a cruel, fearful, shocking deed

<note xml:id="n.323.1">No doubt <persName>Pilsam</persName> and <persName>Lahhak</persName> were with them, as the mention. of ten horses looks like a re-mount for each man. <persName>Ruin</persName> was the son of <persName>Piran</persName>.</note>

</p><p>

<lb/>At that moment came <persName>Piran</persName>

<lb/>like wind, and all the men of wisdom <sic>joyed</sic>.
<lb/>When noble <persName>Farangis</persName> saw him her cheeks
<lb/>were hidden by a flood of tears, she said :—
<lb/><q>Ill hast thou dealt with me! Why hast thou flung me
<lb/>while living into fire?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> dropped off
<lb/>his steed, he rent the raiment that he wore
<lb/>as paladin, and bade the officers
<lb/>to hold awhile. He sought <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>in haste, grief-stricken, and with tearful eyes,
<lb/>to whom he said: <q>O king! live <sic>prosperously</sic>,
<lb/>be evil’s hand afar! What hath occurred,
<lb/>my gracious king! to turn thy face to ill
<lb/>to-day? Why hath the foul <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> gained thy heart,
<lb/>and robbed it of its reverence for God ?
<lb/>Thou hast slain <persName>Siyawush</persName> though innocent,
<lb/>and flung his name and kingship to the dust.
<lb/>News of this wrong will reach <placeName>Iran</placeName> and vex
<lb/>our prosperous times, for many a paladin
<lb/>will march in anguish and revenge against us.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.669"/>

<lb/>The world reposed from ill, the way of God
<lb/>was clear until the wily <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> from Hell
<lb/>smote to the heart the monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName>;
<lb/>and rightly be that <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> accursed,
<lb/>who turned thy counsels to an evil course.
<lb/>Thou wilt repent of this for many a day,
<lb/>and surely writhe and burn in agony.
<lb/>I know not whose ill words have prompted this,
<lb/>or what the Maker's purpose is herein!
<lb/>Now, quit of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, thou hast ill-treated
<lb/>thine own child, and hast madly left thy throne
<lb/>to make a day of woe! She <sic>wisheth</sic> not
<lb/>for fortune, royal state or throne or crown.

<pb n="325"/>

<lb/>make not thyself a butt to all the world
<lb/>by what thou <sic>docst</sic> to thy pregnant child,
<lb/>else while thou <sic>livest</sic> thou wilt be accursed,
<lb/>and when thou <sic>diest</sic> Hell will be thy portion.
<lb/>If now the king would make my spirits bright,
<lb/>let him send <persName>Farangis</persName> to mine abode.
<lb/>If there be apprehension through this babe,

<lb/>Have patience only till the child is born ;

</p><p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Do as thou hast said, for thou
<lb/>hast made me cease to wish to shed her blood.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> rejoiced, his heart was eased from fear.
<lb/>He sought the court-gate, rescued <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/>bestowing many a curse upon the guards,

<lb/>unhurt, amid the applause of camp and court.

<head>The Birth of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>One dark and moonless night, while birds, wild beasts,
<lb/>and cattle slept, <persName>Piran</persName> in dream beheld

<lb/>a splendour that outshone the sun itself,

<lb/>while <persName>Siyawush</persName>, enthroned and sword in hand,
<lb/>called loudly to him, saying: <q> Rest no more!

<lb/>Throw off sweet sleep and think of times to come,

<pb n="326"/>

<lb/>for from to-day new feasts and customs date,

<lb/>because to-night is born Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> Khusrau!</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The chieftain roused him from his sweet repose :

<lb/><persName>Gulshahr</persName> the sunny-featured woke. Pfran

<lb/>said unto her: <q>Arise! Betake thyself

<lb/>to minister to <persName>Farangis</persName>, for I

<lb/>saw <persName>Siyawush</persName> in sleep a moment since,

<lb/>surpassing both the sun and moon in lustre,

<lb/>and crying: <q>Sleep no more, but join the feast

<lb/>of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, the monarch of the world.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Gulshahr</persName> came <sic>hasting</sic> to the Moon and saw

<lb/>the prince already born; she went with cries

<lb/>of joy that made the palace ring again

<lb/>back to <persName>Piran</persName> the chief. <q>Thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say,</q>

<lb/>She cried, <q>that king and Moon are fairly matched !

<lb/>Oh! hasten and behold a miracle—

<lb/>the Maker's greatness and His providence—

<lb/>for thou wilt say: <q>The babe hath need of naught

<lb/>but crown, mail, mace, and lands to- devastate.</q></q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The chieftain visited the royal babe,

<lb/>and offered many praises to the Almighty

<lb/>for that tall stature and those arms and neck.

<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The child is twelve months old!</q>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>’s eyes filled with tears for <persName>Siyawush</persName> ;

<lb/>he uttered curses on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.671"/>

<lb/>and thus addressed the noble company :—

<lb/><q> Although the king shall break my soul therefor

<lb/>I will not suffer him to touch the child,

<lb/>not though he fling me to the crocodiles !</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>When gloomy murk was sleeping, and the sun

<lb/>displayed its rays, the captain of the host,

<lb/>'Twixt fear and hope, went to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>in haste, but waited till the court had cleared ;

<lb/>then came <sic>anear</sic> the famous throne and thus

<lb/>addressed the king: <q>O <sic>sunlike</sic> sovereign

<pb n="327"/>

<lb/>and world-lord, shrewd and versed in magic arts !
<lb/>Thy lot last night was bettered by one slave,
<lb/><q>Dowered by the moon,</q> as thou wouldst say, <q>with sense.</q>
<lb/>he hath engrossed all beauty: thou wouldst say :—
<lb/><q>It simply is the moon inside the cradle!</q>
<lb/>if <persName>Tur</persName> could have his lifetime o’er again
<lb/>he would desire to see this infant’s face.
<lb/>None <sic>looketh</sic> on a picture in a palace
<lb/>so fair. The royal <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> is fresh in him,
<lb/>and thou wouldst say: <q>'Tis valiant <persName>Faridun</persName>
<lb/>in <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and countenance, in hana and foot.</q>
<lb/>now purge thy mind from every thought of ill,
<lb/>exalt thy heart, and illustrate the crown.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>God gave the king a better mind. He banished
<lb/>thoughts of injustice, harshness, and revenge :
<lb/>his spirit <sic>sorrowed</sic> for his evil deed.
<lb/>Then from his heart he heaved a sigh, <sic>repenting</sic>
<lb/>of evil done, and putting by revenge
<lb/>replied : <q> Much evil will befall me now :
<lb/>that is the gist of everybody's words.
<lb/>The age will be <sic>disquieted</sic> by war,
<lb/>for an adviser hath reminded me
<lb/>that from the seed of <persName>Tur</persName> and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>
<lb/>a king of noble birth will lift his head,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.672"/>
<lb/>the world will seek his love and all men pay 
<lb/>him homage in <placeName>Iran</placeName> and <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>What is to be will be, no anxious thought
<lb/>will aught avail; rear not the child at home,
<lb/>but send him to the shepherds on the mountains
<lb/>that he may know me not or why I sent him
<lb/>to them, not know the truth about his birth,
<lb/>but be in ignorance of all the past.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He spake upon the matter as he thought,
<lb/>and deemed this old world young! Canst thou do aught ?

<pb n="328"/>


<lb/>there is no remedy. The world is vast,
<lb/>no hooks or nets of thine will hold it fast ;
<lb/>but if misfortune’s ills thou hast to feel
<lb/>there is instruction also for thy weal.

</p><p>
<lb/>The paladin went forth with joy, his heart
<lb/>full of glad thoughts, began to bless the Maker,
<lb/>and sing the praises of the infant king ;

<lb/>then journeyed to his palace musing thus :—
<lb/><q>This little gift—what will it prove to us?</q>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.673"/>

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="59">
<head>How <persName>Piran</persName> entrusted <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> to the Shepherds</head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> had shepherds called from Mount <placeName>Kalur</placeName>,
<lb/>to whom he spake about the infant prince,
<lb/>then trusted to their care his Heart and Eyes—
<lb/>the child that was so good and admirable—
<lb/>and said: <q>Entreat him like your souls. No wind
<lb/>or dust must see him. Keep him from mischance
<lb/>e’en at the cost of your own eyes and hearts.</q>

<lb/>They said: <q> We will obey.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He furnished them,

<lb/>and sent a nurse to tend the royal babe ;
<lb/>they laid their fingers on their eyes and heads,
<lb/>and took the young prince with them to the mountains.
<lb/>The heavens revolved awhile with matters thus,
<lb/>and looked upon Khusrau with loving face.
<lb/>Now when the brave young prince was seven years <sic>vlc</sic>
<lb/>his prowess told the secret of his birth;
<lb/>he made a bow of wood and string of gut
<lb/>looped at both ends, he made an arrow blunt
<lb/>and <sic>featherless</sic>, and would go on the plain
<lb/>to hunt; at ten he was a valiant warrior,
<lb/>who fought with boars and wolves, anon with lions
<lb/>and leopards, armed with that rude weapon only,

<pb n="329"/>

<lb/>and thus he fared until as time went on
<lb/>his teacher came to ask for fresh directions.
<lb/>The shepherd left the mountains and the waste,
<lb/>and came before <persName>Piran</persName> with loud complaints :—
<lb/><q>I come complaining to the paladin
<lb/>Anent this noble Lion running loose:

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.674"/>
<lb/>he hunted antelopes at first, attacked 
<lb/>no leopards, and avoided lions' tracks,
<lb/>but now to fight fierce lions is the same
<lb/>for him as following the antelope,
<lb/>and yet I must not let him come to harm!
<lb/>The noble paladin <sic>expecteth</sic> this
<lb/>of me.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> on hearing smiled and said :—
<lb/><q> High birth and excellence will show themselves.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He mounted on an easy-going nag
<lb/>to seek the <sic>sunlike</sic> Lion, and observed
<lb/>the stalwart youth as he approached like wind.

<lb/>He kissed <persName>Piran</persName> upon the hand, who, seeing

<lb/>such <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and such a countenance, shed tears,

<lb/>and long and lovingly embraced the youth

<lb/>in secret commune with all-holy God.

<lb/>Khusrau said: <q>O thou pure of Faith! <sic>mayst</sic> thou
<lb/>Illume the country of <placeName>Turan</placeName>, for all

<lb/>that know thee call thee friend! Thou dost embrace
<lb/>a shepherd’s son and <sic>feelest</sic> not ashamed !</q>

<lb/>The heart of wise <persName>Piran</persName> grew hot, his cheeks
<lb/>flushed, he replied: <q>Thou memory of the great,
<lb/>so good and yet defrauded of the world!

<lb/>There is no shepherd that is kin to thee,
<lb/>and on this matter I have much to tell.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He had an <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> steed brought for the youth,
<lb/>clothed him in royal robes and carried him
<lb/>home to the palace, thinking mournfully

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.675"/>
<lb/>of <persName>Siyawush</persName>. He cherished <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, 
<lb/>rejoiced in him, and spent a happy time,

<pb n="330"/>

<lb/>but lost food, rest, and sleep through tenderness,
<lb/>and terror of the anger of the king.

</p><p>

<lb/>With matters thus the heavens turned above

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="60">
<head>How <persName>Piran</persName> brought <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/>One night <persName>Piran</persName> received a messenger,
<lb/>who bade him wait upon <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>The monarch spake about the past: <q>My heart,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>is vexed by thoughts and grief too hard
<lb/>to put aside; this child of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>hath, so to speak, o’<sic>ercast</sic> my day; but will
<lb/>high policy allow a shepherd-swain
<lb/>to rear one of the race of <persName>Faridun</persName> ?
<lb/>Ifill through this child hath been written for me
<lb/>no caution will avert it; 'tis God’s doing.
<lb/>But while the child <sic>suspecteth</sic> not the past
<lb/>let him be glad and we too will rejoice ;
<lb/>still, if he <sic>showeth</sic> any evil bent,
<lb/>he, as his father did, must lose his head.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>O king! thou <sic>needest</sic> none
<lb/>to teach thee. This boy is as mad folk are!
<lb/>What notions can he have about the past ?
<lb/>A child brought up by shepherds on the mountains
<lb/>is like wild animals; what can he know ?
<lb/>The foster-father told me <sic>yester</sic>-night :—
<lb/><q>The boy is comely but devoid of wits.</q>
<lb/>in spite of beauty, stature, form, and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,
<lb/>the prince’s head yet <sic>lacketh</sic> understanding ;
<lb/>vex not thyself and think no more hereof.
<lb/>What said the sage—a man exceeding wise ?

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.676"/>
<lb/><q>More potent than the sire the nurse will prove,
<lb/>but the great secret is the mother’s love.</q>

<pb n="331"/>

<lb/>if at this time the king shall order me,
<lb/>I will present this lauded youth to him,
<lb/>but make me easy by a promise first
<lb/>and swear by such an oath as kings employ.
<lb/>Shah <persName>Faridun</persName>, when he affirmed a matter,
<lb/>swore by his crown and throne and diadem ;
<lb/>tur, who enjoyed both fortune and high state,
<lb/>swore by the Ruler of the universe ;
<lb/>and that great king Zadsham, thy grandsire, swore
<lb/>by Him that <sic>ruleth</sic> <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>, <rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs>, and Sun.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The wits of fierce <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> were lulled
<lb/>at hearing this, he swore a royal oath
<lb/>by white day and by sombre night, by God—
<lb/>the Omnipotent, the Maker of the world,
<lb/>the Maker of the sky, the soul, and beasts :—
<lb/><q>No harm shall come upon the boy through me,
<lb/>and I will never breathe sharp breath on him.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> then kissed the ground and said: <q>O king,
<lb/>who <sic>judgest</sic> justly and art wed to justice !
<lb/>Be wisdom evermore thy guide to good,
<lb/>be earth and time the dust beneath thy feet.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>He came in haste to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> with cheeks
<lb/>like <sic>cercis</sic>-blossom, glad exceedingly,
<lb/>and said: <q> Put wisdom from thee. If the king
<lb/>shall talk to thee of fight, talk thou of feast.
<lb/>Appear before him as an alien
<lb/>and speak insanely, show no kind of sense,
<lb/>and thus thou <sic>mayst</sic> perchance outlive the day.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> equipped him with a royal crown
<lb/>and belt, and called for him a pretty palfrey
<lb/>whereon the shrewd, young hero sat and rode
<lb/>toward the palace of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Tears filled the eyes of all on his account,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.677"/>
<lb/>and shouts were raised before him: <q>Clear the way:

<lb/>When he arrived <persName>Piran</persName> the general

<pb n="332"/>

<lb/>took him before the king. The grandsire’s cheeks
<lb/>grew wet with tears of shame, meanwhile <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>shook like a willow, fearing for Khusrau.
<lb/>The king remembering his pledge and spurning
<lb/>all fell designs, gazed in astonishment
<lb/>upon that royal neck, the young man’s hands,
<lb/>his gait, his bearing, and his dignity.
<lb/>There was a pause. The monarch’s face relaxed,
<lb/>and love at length prevailed within his heart.
<lb/><q>O youthful shepherd!</q> said <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/><q> Describe to me thy life by day and night.
<lb/>On what wise hast thou shepherded thy flock ?
<lb/>What is the number of thy sheep and goats?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Khusrau thus answered him: <q>There is no game:
<lb/>besides I have not arrow, bow, or string.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch asked him next about his teacher,
<lb/>and whether he was prosperous or not.
<lb/>Khusrau replied: <q> Where’er there is a leopard
<lb/>the hearts of valiant warriors are rent.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> the third time questioned him
<lb/>about <placeName>Iran</placeName>, his parents, and his home.
<lb/><q>The rending lion,</q> thus he made reply,
<lb/><q>Is not o’er-powered by a fighting-dog.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>The king said: <q> Wilt thou go hence to <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>to him who is the monarch of the brave ?</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Khusrau thus answered him: <q> Two nights ago
<lb/>a horseman passed me on the hills and plains.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch smiled and blossomed like a rose,
<lb/>then asked of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> in.gentler tones :—
<lb/><q> Dost thou not wish to learn to write? Hast thou
<lb/>no wish for vengeance on thine enemies ?</q>

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.678"/><p>
<lb/>He said: <q>There is no cream upon the milk:
<lb/>I fain would drive the shepherds from the plain.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The monarch smiled at what Khusrau had answered,
<lb/>and turning to the captain of the host
<lb/>said thus to him: <q>The fellow is a fool:

<pb n="333"/>

<lb/>I ask of heads; he <sic>answereth</sic> of feet !

<lb/>In sooth no good or ill will come from him :

<lb/>of other <sic>stutf</sic> are they that seek revenge.

<lb/>Go! Send him by the hand of some good man,
<lb/>and let his mother have him back to her.
<lb/>Dispatch him to <persName>Siyawush</persName>, allow

<lb/>no evil teachers to resort to him,

<lb/>but furnish him with treasure, money, steeds,
<lb/>attendants, and <sic>whate</sic>’er may serve his needs.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="61">
<head>How <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> went to <persName>Siyawush</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/><q> Bestir thyself,</q> <persName>Piran</persName> said to the prince,
<lb/>then took him from the presence of the king,
<lb/>and went back to his palace, flushed with joy
<lb/>and triumph, since the eye of ill was closed.
<lb/>He said: <q>A new Tree <sic>fruiteth</sic> in the world
<lb/>through Him that <sic>ruleth</sic> over destiny.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>He <sic>oped</sic> the portals of his ancient hoards
<lb/>and furnished all that <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> required—
<lb/>brocade, dinars, and precious stones, with pearls,
<lb/>steeds, implements of war, and crowns and girdles,
<lb/>besides a throne and purses full of <sic>drachms</sic>,
<lb/>with <sic>carpetings</sic> and matters great and small.
<lb/>He brought them all to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> with speed,
<lb/>and with the present gave his blessing also,
<lb/>then sent both son and mother to the seat
<lb/>that good king <persName>Siyawush</persName> had built. They went
<lb/>their way <sic>rejoicingly</sic> toward the place,
<lb/>which had become by then a brake of thorns.
<lb/>When <persName>Farangis</persName> and <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> arrived
<lb/>much folk from every side appeared to greet them,
<lb/>while all the city’s tongues were full of praise :

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.679"/>
<lb/><q>Thus then,</q> they said, <q>hath fortune made a Shoot 
<lb/>sprout from the razed roots of a noble Tree!

<pb n="334"/>


<lb/>far be the eye of evil from the king,
<lb/>and may light fill the soul of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>The brambles of the city turned to box,
<lb/>the meadow-grass to noble cypresses ;
<lb/>the very beasts rejoiced and all the folk
<lb/>felt solace for the death of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>since <sic>cloudward</sic> from the dust that drank his blood
<lb/>there rose an Evergreen of sweet perfume,
<lb/>upon whose leaves his likeness was portrayed,
<lb/>exhaling through his love the scent of musk,
<lb/>and flourishing in winter as in spring
<lb/>would be a prayer-place for the sorrowful.
<lb/>This is the process of the ancient sky—
<lb/>it <sic>robbeth</sic> infants of their mother’s breast,
<lb/>and to the dust <sic>deposeth</sic> suddenly
<lb/>a heart by fondness for the world possessed.
<lb/>Brave not the world but seek its joys to win ;
<lb/>it <sic>hideth</sic> evils more than thou canst know,
<lb/>yet treat it as a garden and therein
<lb/>abstain from sniffing at the leaves of woe,
<lb/>for whether thou art king or shod by want
<lb/>in any case thy length of days is scant.
<lb/>Vex not thy soul, this home is but a cheat,
<lb/>thy sole possession is a narrow bier ;
<lb/>what <sic>needeth</sic> thine amassing? Sit and eat;
<lb/>god is thy treasurer, thou need’st not fear.
<lb/>Albeit here much happiness is found
<lb/>the world hath no real love for anyone.
<lb/>'Twill raise a head one moment to the sun,
<lb/>and in the next will lay it underground.
<lb/>It is the process of the lofty sky
<lb/>to bring down princes and set slaves on high.

<div type="textpart" subtype="part" n="5"><head>Part V: how <persName>Rustam</persName> avenged <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and how <persName>Giv</persName> brought <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> to <placeName>Iran</placeName></head>

<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>

<p>The poet, after bewailing the approach of old age, tells of the arrival in <placeName>Iran</placeName> of the news of the death of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, of the remorse of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, and of the wrath of <persName>Rustam</persName>, who slays <persName>Sudaba</persName>, invades <placeName>Turan</placeName>, expels <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, and rules there himself for seven years; after which he retires to <placeName>Sistan</placeName>. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> returns, recovers his authority, and wars with success against <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</p>

<p>At this juncture <persName>Gudarz</persName> is warned in a dream to have search made for <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, the son of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, who is kept as a prisoner of state by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName> departs on the quest. His adventures are described, and he ultimately returns to <placeName>Iran</placeName> in company with <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> and his mother <persName>Farangis</persName> in spite of all the efforts of <persName>Piran</persName> and <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> to stop them.</p>

<p>Subsequently a quarrel takes place between <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName> as to whether <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> or <persName>Fariburz</persName> shall be associated as joint Shah with <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, who puts the matter to the test and <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> is successful.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>

<p>The most conspicuous character in this part is <persName>Giv</persName>, a word which means <q>warrior.</q> The feats which he is described as performing would he more than worthy of <persName>Rustam</persName> himself, who, after his withdrawal <sic>trom</sic> <placeName>Turan</placeName>, is relegated for a time to the background. We must conceive, as the <rs type="ethnic">Persians</rs> themselves would, that <persName>Giv</persName>, employed on the sacred mission of discovering and bringing to <placeName>Iran</placeName> the destined prince, was favoured with divine assistance in his enterprise.</p>

<p>§ 31. The quarrel between <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>, as to the respective claims of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> and <persName>Fariburz</persName> to be associated as Shah with <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, bears important results in the next reign. <persName>Tus</persName> was the


<pb n="336"/>



son of <persName>Naudar</persName>, and he and his brother <persName>Gustaham</persName> were deliberately passed over after the death of that Shah, and again after the death of <persName>Garshasp</persName>, when <persName>Kai Kubad</persName> was fetched from Mount <placeName>Alburz</placeName> to fill the vacant throne.<ref target="n.336.1"/> <persName>Tus</persName> can never forget that he is the direct representative of the line of the Pishdadian Shahs, and, despairing of ever becoming Shah himself, he on this occasion attempts to obtain power indirectly by advocating the claims of a candidate of his own.</p>

<p>§§ 34, 35. In the account of the expedition of <persName>Fariburz</persName> and <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> to <placeName>Ardabil</placeName> we have another proof of the truth of the view, often advanced in the present work, that the true seat of the legends of the <persName>Shahnama</persName> is to be looked for in the regions lying between the <placeName>Euxine</placeName> and the <placeName>Caspian</placeName>. <placeName>Ardabil</placeName> is in Azarbdaijan, a land exposed to invasions from the north through the Pass of
<lb/><placeName>Darband</placeName>, and where the numerous fire-springs doubtless gave rise to the legend of the heat which distressed the host of <persName>Fariburz</persName> in the neighbourhood of the castle of <persName>Bahman</persName>.</p>

<lb/>When matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> heard his senses fled ;

<lb/>a wail rose from <placeName>Zabul</placeName>, <persName>Zal</persName> tore his cheeks,

<lb/>and scattered dust upon his crown and shoulders,

<lb/>thus passed a week in heaviness and mourning,

<lb/>but on the eighth day rose the trumpet-blast,

<lb/>and at the gate of elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>

<lb/>troops gathered from <placeName>Kashmir</placeName> and from <placeName>Zabul</placeName>.

<lb/>Blood in his eyes and vengeance in his heart

<lb/>he marched toward the court of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>.

<lb/>On coming near <placeName>Iran</placeName> he rent his robe

<lb/>of office, swearing by the Almighty Judge :—


<lb/><q>I will not rest from arms and war or wash

<lb/>dust from my face, whereat we need not grieve,

</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.683"/><p>
<lb/>All dust from head to foot he came before

<lb/><q>The noxious weeds that thou hast sown, O king!
<lb/>Are fruiting now! Thy passion for <persName>Sudaba</persName>,

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> perceived on <persName>Rustam</persName>’s countenance

<lb/>how great his love was by his tears of blood,
<lb/>and out of shame said nothing in reply,

<lb/>but poured down scalding tears. The chief departed

<lb/>He dragged her from the bower by her hair,
<lb/>dragged her all bleeding from her throne and <sic>clave</sic> h

<lb/>while Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> sat passive on his throne;

<lb/>this done, the matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> felt a pang

<lb/>yet keener in his heart, he sought his palace

<lb/>in pain and woe, with blood-drops in his eyes,

<lb/><q>I stake heart, soul, and body on revenge,

<lb/>for in this world there is no man of name

<lb/>in arms like <persName>Siyawush</persName> the cavalier.

<lb/>Treat not the matter lightly. None can deem

<lb/>and make the earth run like <placeName>Jihun</placeName> with blood.
<lb/>By God! while I am living in the world

<lb/>I will not cease to grieve for <persName>Siyawush</persName>.

<lb/>I fain would chafe my face and eyes; perchance

<lb/>he beat the <sic>tymbals</sic>, marched out to the desert,

<lb/>so that cuirass and buckle brake, and took him
<lb/>in such a fashion from the poplar saddle
<lb/>that thou hadst said: <q> He <sic>dealeth</sic> with a fly!</q>
<lb/>Flung him upon the dust and then dismounting,

<lb/>cut off the head of his illustrious foe,

<lb/><q>See the first head of our revenge! The seed

<lb/>They gave up all the country to the flames,
<lb/>the reek rose to high heaven, and <persName>Faramarz</persName>
<lb/>wrote to his sire respecting <persName>Warazad</persName> :—
<lb/><q>I opened wide the door of war and vengeance,
<lb/>I took him from his sell of poplar wood,

<head>How <persName>Surkha</persName> led his Troops to fight with <persName>Rustam</persName></head>

<lb/>A runner came and told <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> :—
<lb/><q> The elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> hath come forth
<lb/>to war, the Iranian chieftains are assembled;
<lb/>they have, <sic>alack</sic>! beheaded <persName>Warazad</persName>,
<lb/>and robbed the marches of <placeName>Turan</placeName> of breath ;

<lb/>and given up his country to the flames,</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> was grieved and called to mind
<lb/>the ancient prophecy that he had heard
<lb/>from wise <sic>archmages</sic> and astrologers ;<ref target="n.344.1"/>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.689"/>
<lb/>he summoned all the nobles, paid his troops,
<lb/>gave <sic>largess</sic> from his treasures, and brought home
<lb/>all herds of horses that were on the waste,
<lb/>he took his minister’s and treasurer’s keys
<lb/>to <sic>ope</sic> his magazines, and furnished swords,
<lb/>horse-armour, <sic>maces</sic>, and artillery,
<lb/>dinars, gold, gems, crowns, torques, and golden belts,
<lb/>and strewed the palace and the ground with <sic>drachms</sic>.
<lb/>With troops equipped and treasure lavished on them
<lb/>he sounded <sic>kettledrum</sic> and Indian gong,
<lb/>and then the horsemen turned their thoughts to war.
<lb/>He marched from <placeName>Gang</placeName>, and, having reached the open,
<lb/>called <persName>Surkha</persName> and spake much of <persName>Rustam</persName>, saying :—
<lb/><q> Lead thirty thousand Sabres swift as wind
<lb/>to <placeName>Sipanjab</placeName>, ignoring rest and pleasure,
<lb/>for <persName>Faramarz</persName> is there. Send me his head;
<lb/>but ware the son of <persName>Zal</persName>! Thou hast no peer

<lb/>Thou art mine own son and my loyal subject,

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.690"/><p>
<lb/>When <persName>Surkha</persName> left the presence of his sire

<lb/>he took the troops and standard to the plain,

<lb/>and marched along like wind to <placeName>Sipanjab</placeName>,

<lb/>intent on war. The outposts saw the dust,

<lb/>turned round, and hurried in to <persName>Faramarz</persName>.

<lb/>The din of drums rose from the Iranian troops,

<lb/>whose dust transformed the earth to ebony ;

<lb/>the clamour of the cavaliers and chargers

<lb/>rose from the plain, out-topping Sol and <rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs> ;

<lb/>the bright steel <sic>falchions</sic> flashed like diamonds,

<lb/>the <sic>spearpoints</sic> fed on blood. Thou wouldst have said :—

<lb/><q> An exhalation <sic>riseth</sic> from the earth,

<lb/>and giveth fuel to the flames of war.</q>

<lb/>The earth from end to end was heaped with slain ;

<lb/>their severed heads were scattered everywhere.

<lb/>As <persName>Surkha</persName> marked the progress of the fight

<lb/>he saw the spearhead of prince <persName>Faramarz</persName>,

<lb/>then gave the rein to his high-crested steed,

<lb/>and, giving up the bow, charged with the spear,

<lb/>while <persName>Faramarz</persName>, abandoning the centre,

<lb/>came forth with lance in hand to counter him,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.691"/>
<lb/>and by a thrust swift as <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs> 

<lb/>laid him unseated on his horse’s neck,

<lb/>while with the impetus and that rude shock

<lb/>the lance was shivered. Then the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> chiefs

<lb/>advanced intent on battle and revenge,

<lb/>while <persName>Surkha</persName> in the anguish of defeat

<lb/>fled. Fardmarz, like some mad elephant,

<lb/>pursued him, brandishing an Indian sword,

<lb/>the Iranian horse rushed after him like <sic>divs</sic>,

<lb/>and shouted. Fardmarz came up with <persName>Surkha</persName>

<lb/>and, like a leopard springing, seized his girdle,

<lb/>unseated him, and hurled him to the ground,



<pb n="346"/>

<lb/>then, driving him afoot, brought him to camp,
<lb/>disgraced, With that the flag of matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>was seen approaching mid the tramp of troops
<lb/>and elephants ; the prince went to his father
<lb/>as quick as dust and told of his success.
<lb/>In front was <persName>Surkha</persName> with his hands in bonds,
<lb/>there lay the severed neck of <persName>Warazad</persName> ;
<lb/>the plain and hollows were all filled with slain,
<lb/>the foe in full retreat. The soldiers blessed
<lb/>the brave, young paladin, while peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>gave blessings to him also and bestowed
<lb/>great <sic>largess</sic> on the poor. Of <persName>Faramarz</persName>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.692"/>
<lb/>spake elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q> He whose head
<lb/>is raised o’er others must have noble nature,
<lb/>instruction, prowess, and befriending wisdom:
<lb/>his nature using these will bring the world
<lb/>beneath his feet by virtue of his manhood.
<lb/>Thou <sic>seest</sic> naught but brightness in a flame,
<lb/>yet he is burned that <sic>toucheth</sic>. 'Tis not strange
<lb/>that <persName>Faramarz</persName> should triumph, for the heart
<lb/>oF steel is full of fire, and when steel <sic>fighteth</sic>
<lb/>with flint the secret of its heart is shown.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Then elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> looked on <persName>Surkha</persName>—
<lb/>a noble Cypress of the garth was he,
<lb/>his breast was like a lion’s, and his cheeks
<lb/>were like the spring, cheeks where black musk was traced

<lb/>on roses—bade men bear him to the plain,
<lb/>and executioners with bowl and dagger,
<lb/>to make his hands fast in the lasso’s coils,
<lb/>to throw him like a sheep upon the ground,
<lb/>behead him as was done to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>and let the vultures be his winding-sheet.
<lb/>When <persName>Tus</persName> the general heard he went in haste
<lb/>to do the bloody deed, Then <persName>Surkha</persName> said :—
<lb/><q>O most exalted king! why slay me guiltless,

<pb n="347"/>

<lb/>for <persName>Siyawush</persName> was of my years, my friend ?

<lb/>My soul was full of pain and grief for him,

<lb/>by day and night my eyes o’<sic>erflow</sic> with tears ;

<lb/>I ever <sic>oped</sic> my lips to curse the man

<lb/>by whom the prince’s head was stricken off—

<lb/>the man that brought the dagger and the bowl.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The heart of <persName>Tus</persName> was very pitiful

<lb/>for that illustrious but luckless prince.


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.693"/>
<lb/>He went to <persName>Rustam</persName> and repeated to him 

<lb/>the pleading of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> monarch’s son,

<lb/>but <persName>Rustam</persName> answered: <q> If there be a king

<lb/>who should be thus heart-seared and sad, then may

<lb/>the heart and spirit of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>be ever full of pain, his eyes of tears.

<lb/>This youth, engendered by those <sic>recreant</sic> loins,

<lb/>will but employ fresh stratagems and guile.

<lb/>As <persName>Siyawush</persName> was laid upon the ground

<lb/>with shoulders, breast, and hair <sic>bedrenched</sic> with blood,

<lb/>so by the head and life of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,

<lb/>the glorious, noble ruler of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>I swear that every <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> that I find

<lb/>throughout my life, be he a king or slave,

<lb/>so he be of these marches and this folk,

<lb/>I will behead.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>And <sic>therewithal</sic> that Lion

<lb/>looked at <persName>Zawara</persName> and commanded him

<lb/>in peremptory tones to do the deed

<lb/>of blood. He took the dagger and the bowl,

<lb/>and gave the youth to executioners,

<lb/>who cut his throat—a cry, and all was over.

<lb/>What wouldst thou, world! with those whom thou hast fed ?

<lb/>Fed! Say thy broken-hearted slaves instead !
</p><p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> took the head off, hung the trunk

<lb/>feet upward on a gibbet, and flung dust

<pb n="348"/>

<lb/>in vengeance on the corpse, which afterwards
<lb/>the soldiers hacked to pieces with their swords.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<head>How <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> led forth the Host to avenge his Son</head>
<p>

<lb/>When the Turanian troops returned from battle,

<lb/>their bodies bloody and their heads all dust,

<lb/>they said: <q>The noble chieftain hath been slain,

<lb/>his eager fortune hath been overturned,

<lb/>and they have set his severed head and body

<lb/>blood-<sic>boltered</sic> upside down upon a gibbet!

<lb/>The people of <placeName>Iran</placeName> are all in arms,

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> hung down his head and crown,

<lb/>plucked out his hair, shed tears, and rent his robes,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.694"/>
<lb/>cast dust upon his head, and cried aloud :—

<lb/><q>Q prince! O gallant heart! O warrior!

<lb/>O chief! O <sic>manofname</sic>! Ohero! King!

<lb/>Woe for that <sic>moonlike</sic> cheek of <sic>cercis</sic>-bloom !

<lb/>Woe for that royal breast and mien and stature!

<lb/>Thy sire shall ne’er seek rest unless it be

<lb/>upon his charger’s saddle on the field.</q>

<lb/>Then to his men: <q>Our ease and feasts are over.

<lb/>Keep ye your eyes wide open for revenge,

<lb/>and make your jerkin and cuirass your bed.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Rose at his gate the din of kettledrums:

<lb/>his warriors armed. Upon the elephants

<lb/>the trumpets blared, the world was like a sea

<lb/>of indigo, and when they bound the drums

<lb/>upon the elephants heaven kissed the earth.

<lb/>Then said the king: <q> Ye chiefs and warriors!

<lb/>When both sides sound the drum he is no soldier

<lb/>that <sic>laggeth</sic>. Let our hearts be full of vengeance,

<lb/>full as the bodies of our foes with javelins !</q></p>

<pb n="349"/>

<p>Thus spake he to the troops, then bade to sound
<lb/>the <sic>clarions</sic>, cymbals, and the Indian bells.
<lb/>Arose the war-cry and the blare of trumpets,
<lb/>the din of cornet, pipe, and <sic>kettledrum</sic>,
<lb/>earth shook beneath the trampling of the steeds,
<lb/>the <sic>shoutings</sic> of the soldiers reached the clouds.


</p><p>

<lb/>Now when that army’s dust rose from the plain
<lb/>one came to vengeful <persName>Rustam</persName> and spake thus :—
<lb/><q> <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> the chieftain is at hand ;
<lb/>his troops move like a vessel o’er the sea.
<lb/>All have prepared for combat and revenge,
<lb/>and set their hands to blood.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Now when he heard :—
<lb/><q>The monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName> hath come in sight,</q>
<lb/>The troops marched forth with <persName>Kawa</persName>’s flag; the air
<lb/>turned blue with warriors' swords; a shout arose

<lb/>from both sides and the world was filled with fighters. 
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The sun and moon are darkened,

</p><p>

<lb/>The monarch of <placeName>Turan</placeName> arrayed his men,

<lb/>Upon the right <persName>Bahman</persName> came proudly on

<lb/>and in the centre was the king in person.
<lb/>On his side <persName>Rustam</persName> too arrayed his host,
<lb/>and earth was lost in dust. He took the centre
<lb/>with <persName>Faramarz</persName> in front and in the rear
<lb/><persName>Zawara</persName>; on the left he placed <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Hajir</persName>, and other chiefs. He stationed <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>and <persName>Tus</persName>—those wary horsemen—on the right
<lb/>with trump and drum, then armed himself for battle,

<lb/>Unless thou here <sic>forbiddest</sic> me the use

</p><p>

<lb/>The king rejoiced

<lb/>Thereat and raised his spearpoint o’er the sun,

<lb/>In sooth no elephant will conquer thee.
<lb/>If thou dost take that elephantine chief
<lb/>the age will rest from strife, and not a man

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> was grieved and, coming to the king,
<lb/>said to him: <q>This young man in his rash youth
<lb/>is laying violent hands upon himself,
<lb/>for, if he combat with the matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>he will but lay his own head in the dust.
<lb/>The king will share in his disgrace, 'twill break

<lb/>my younger brother, and my love for him

<pb n="351"/>

<lb/>is greater than an elder brother's love.</q>

<lb/><persName>Pilsam</persName> rejoined: <q>My heart doth not <sic>misgive</sic> me,
<lb/>and, if I fight this warlike Crocodile,
<lb/>by thy good fortune I will bring no shame
<lb/>upon the king. Thou once beheld’st my prowess

<lb/>and verily my strength is greater now.
<lb/>It is not right of thee to break my spirit ;
<lb/>the enterprise is well within my reach:
<lb/>haunt not the portal of an evil star.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The monarch, hearing what <persName>Pilsam</persName> replied,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.697"/>
<lb/>gave him a <sic>barded</sic> charger, helm, cuirass,

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, furious at the challenge, drew his sword

</p><p>

<lb/>The champions closed. <persName>Pilsam</persName>

<lb/>struck with his spear at <persName>Giv</persName>, who in dismay
<lb/>lost both his stirrups. Fardmarz saw this,
<lb/>and went at once to aid his gallant comrade;
<lb/>he struck athwart <persName>Pilsam</persName>’s spear with his sword,
<lb/>and cut it like a reed; he struck once more,

<lb/>who wheeled like some fierce lion’on the plain

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.698"/>

<lb/>And thought: <q> Assuredly his time hath come,

<lb/>He spake thus to his troops: <q> Let none advance
<lb/>a single step from where he <sic>standeth</sic> now.
<lb/>I go to prove the prowess of <persName>Pilsam</persName>,
<lb/>and try his <sic>lustihood</sic>, his strength, and spirit.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He took a weighty spear, gripped fast his steed
<lb/>with both his legs, and, putting on his helmet,
<lb/>pressed on the stirrups, let the reins hang loose,
<lb/>and lowered the shining spear-head to his eye,
<lb/>he wheeled about and foaming at the lips
<lb/>rushed from the centre toward the <sic>foemen</sic>’s lines,
<lb/>and cried: <q>O famed <persName>Pilsam</persName>! thou called’st me

<lb/>and ne’er turn rein toward a battle more,
<lb/>my heart is burned with pity for thy youth:

<lb/>He spake and urged his charger on. He came

<lb/>and took him from the saddle like a ball,

<lb/>exclaiming : <q> Dress it in brocade of gold,
<lb/>for now 'tis <sic>lapislazuli</sic> with dust !</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then wheeling round he went back to the centre.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> rained tears; the body of <persName>Pilsam</persName>
<lb/>was past a leech’s skill. The heart of all

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.699"/>
<lb/>a shout rose from both hosts; the din of chiefs

<lb/>Earth trembled with the chargers' tramp, the hills
<lb/>were seas of blood, the plains were hills of slain.
<lb/>The cries and blaring <sic>clarions</sic> shook the sky,

<lb/>the stones were coral and the dust was gore;

<lb/>the heads of many chieftains were laid low,

<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q>The sky is raining blood.</q>
<lb/>It was no time for love 'twixt sire and son.

<lb/>A breeze arose upon the battlefield,

<lb/>and murky dust usurped the firmament.

<lb/>Then both hosts charged with fury o’er the plain

<lb/>of <persName>Wisa</persName>, saved him from that <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s clutch.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.701"/>

<lb/>The hero-flinging crown-<sic>bestower</sic> followed

<lb/><persName>Human</persName> in furious haste but caught him not,

<lb/>his time had not yet come. Shouts rose to heaven,
<lb/>and massive <sic>maces</sic> whirled. There came to <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>some of the army of <placeName>Iran</placeName> lest harm

<lb/>might fall upon him, and the noble <persName>Tus</persName>

<lb/>made question of him: <q>Felt the Elephant

<lb/>the impact of the Onager’s assault ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He answered: <q> Neither heart of stone nor anvil
<lb/>can bear the buffets of a massive mace
<lb/>when wielded by a man with chest and arms;

<lb/>as for that mace <sic>wherewith</sic> <persName>Human</persName> struck me—
<lb/>call it not iron; it was merely wax.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName>’s <sic>foeman</sic> turned and fled the troops
<lb/>all gave a shout and raised their spearheads <sic>cloudward</sic>.
<lb/>If slain and wounded covered not the ground
<lb/>it was a field of tulips and of saffron ;

<lb/>the horses trampled blood, the elephants

<lb/>had feet <sic>incarnadined</sic>. The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> fled,
<lb/>swift as the wind, because the arm of <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>did execution on them. For three leagues

<lb/>that matchless hero like a raging dragon
<lb/>pursued the foe. Then he returned to camp,
<lb/>and thou hadst said that heaven befriended him;
<lb/>the soldiers came back satiate with spoil ;

<lb/>and iron, gold, and silver, weapon, rein,
<lb/>spearhead, and girdle covered all the plain.

<lb/>The king, on hearing that a host pursued him,

<lb/>marched. his own forces to the sea of <placeName>Chin</placeName>;

<lb/>the broad expanse of earth was narrowed to him.
<lb/>He went across the sea to where he would,

<lb/>and thus addressed <persName>Piran</persName>: <q> Advise me well

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>We must not rashly slay him,

<lb/>and fix his residence within <placeName>Khutan</placeName>.

<lb/>We must not give occasion to ill-doers

<lb/>The king replied: <q>O master of wise <sic>rede</sic>!
<lb/>Thou art my guide to good. Use all dispatch ;
<lb/>'Tis not a matter that will brook delay.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> at once sent off a prudent man

<lb/>he gave unstinted praise, did reverence,

<lb/>Khusrau, bewildered, sped to tell his mother :—

<lb/>folk saw no cultured tract. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>

<lb/>no horses, treasures, crowns, or thrones were there,
<lb/>there was no verdant leafage on the trees;
<lb/>the world had been consumed with fire, and all

<lb/>and sprung from Tir upon the mother’s side,

<lb/>thus heaven hath ordained thee to remove

<lb/>Howbeit from his loins God caused to shoot

<lb/>At His command <persName>Giv</persName> girded up his loins,

<lb/>he took no comrade with him, but resigned
<lb/>to God his body used to luxury ;
<lb/>if, when he reached the marches of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>he found a man alone <persName>Giv</persName> questioned him

<lb/>to slay him, hitch him in the lasso’s noose,
<lb/>drag him aside, and cover him with dust,
<lb/>that no one might discover his own secret,
<lb/>or hear his name or any news of him.
<lb/>He had awhile a countryman as guide
<lb/>from whom he hid the object of his quest.
<lb/>At length he said: <q>I fain would ask a question

<head>The Finding of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName></head>
<p>

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> like a madman roamed about to find
<lb/>some traces of the prince. While seven years passed
<lb/>his loins were galled by sword and leathern girdle.
<lb/>He fed on <sic>onagers</sic> and wore their skins,
<lb/>at times had brackish water and green herbs,
<lb/>and went about the desert and the mountains
<lb/>in travail and in hardship far from men,

</p><p>
<lb/>Now at the time when <persName>Rustam</persName> led his host
<lb/>across the river to the Iranian side

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> returned to <placeName>Gang</placeName>, Tuirdn


<pb n="370"/>

<lb/>came to his hand again, and then he bade
<lb/>piran : <q> Bring hither ill-starred <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>back from <placeName>Machin</placeName> and give him to his mother,
<lb/>but have the roads well watched.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> dispatched
<lb/>a messenger upon a noble camel,
<lb/>and had the son of <persName>Siyawush</persName> brought back—
<lb/>a prudent and a life-inspiring youth—
<lb/>and gave him to his mother. Passed a while.

</p><p>
<lb/>As gallant <persName>Giv</persName> was roaming o’er <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>in melancholy case, it so fell out

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.717"/>

<lb/>one day that, full of anxious thoughts, he came
<lb/>within the precincts of a famous wood,
<lb/>and wandered woe-begone along the mead ;
<lb/>the world was <sic>jocund</sic> but his heart was sad.
<lb/>He saw the earth all verdant, brooks a-brim,
<lb/>and all the scene right apt for rest and sleep.
<lb/>Dismounting from his horse he turned it loose,
<lb/>and laid him down but with an anxious heart.
<lb/>He said: <q> The foul <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> verily possessed
<lb/>the paladin when he beheld that dream.
<lb/>I find no traces here of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> :
<lb/>what do I gain by all my wanderings ?
<lb/>Now while my comrades are engaged in war,
<lb/>and while my friends are sitting at the feast,
<lb/>these seeking pleasure, those in quest of fame,
<lb/>my lot is throwing walnuts on a dome !
<lb/>I do but spend my soul in vain, 'tis like
<lb/>a bended bow; Khusrau hath not been born
<lb/>at all, or fate hath flung him to the winds.
<lb/>I get but toil and hardship by my quest:
<lb/>blest is the man that <sic>perisheth</sic> by poison.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>With heart all sorrowful he roamed about
<lb/>those meadows in his search, and spied afar
<lb/>beside a sparkling stream a beauteous youth
<lb/>of cypress-height, a wine-cup in his hand,

<pb n="371"/>

<lb/>and on his head a bright, sweet wreath. His mien
<lb/>Betokened <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and wisdom. Thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>'Tis <persName>Siyawush</persName> upon his ivory throne,
<lb/>and turquoise-crowned ; his looks exhale the scent
<lb/>of love itself, his locks adorn the crown.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> thought: <q> This is none other than the prince!
<lb/>Naught but a throne <sic>befitteth</sic> such a mien.</q>


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.718"/>
<lb/>Dismounting from his charger he advanced 
<lb/>on foot and, as he drew <sic>anear</sic>, the bolts
<lb/>were loosened on the portal of his travail,
<lb/>and all his splendid treasure came in sight.
<lb/>When <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> looked from beside the stream
<lb/>he smiled, while gladness made his heart to throb,
<lb/>and thought: <q>This warrior is none else but <persName>Giv</persName>:
<lb/>this land hath not a chief of such a stamp.
<lb/>He is engaged in making quest for me
<lb/>to bear me to <placeName>Iran</placeName> to make me Shah.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>As that <sic>redoubted</sic> warrior approached,
<lb/>Khusrau the prince moved forward from his place,
<lb/>and said to him: <q>O <persName>Giv</persName>! thou art well come;
<lb/>thy coming here is wisdom’s fitting gift.
<lb/>How didst thou make thy passage to this land ?
<lb/>What tidings hast thou touching <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>and Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>? Are they in happiness,
<lb/>and do they in their hearts think of Khusrau ?
<lb/>How is it with the elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>the aspiring one, with <persName>Zal</persName>, and all the rest ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> heard the words amazed, invoked the name
<lb/>of God, and answered: <q>O exalted chief!
<lb/>All yearn for thee. Methinketh that thou art
<lb/>the son of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, of royal race,
<lb/>and wise; but say, thou head of upright men!.
<lb/>Who told thee of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <persName>Giv</persName>, and <persName>Kishwad</persName> ?
<lb/>May <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and happiness be thine.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He answered :—

<lb/><q>O lion-man! my mother told me this—

<pb n="372"/>

<lb/>that when my father by the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of God
<lb/>entrusted unto her his last commands,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.719"/>
<lb/>he said: <q>Whatever mischief may befall me,
<lb/>still in the end will <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> appear,
<lb/>and bring a key to open all the locks.

<lb/>When he hath grown a noble warrior

<lb/>the doughty <persName>Giv</persName> will come forth from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and bear him to the throne among the nobles
<lb/>and lion-men. His valour will restore

<lb/>the world, and execute revenge for me.</q></q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> said: <q>O head of all the chiefs! what mark
<lb/>hast thou to indicate the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of kingship ?
<lb/>The mark of <persName>Siyawush</persName> was manifest
<lb/>as '<sic>twere</sic> a drop of pitch upon a rose-bed,
<lb/>uncover then and show to me thine arm,
<lb/>because thy mark is known to every one.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The prince made bare his arm and <persName>Giv</persName> perceived
<lb/>the black mark on it. Now this mark had been
<lb/>a birth-mark from the time of <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>—

<lb/>a clear distinction of the <rs type="ethnic">Kaian</rs> race.

<lb/>When <persName>Giv</persName> beheld that mark he did obeisance,
<lb/>and weeping told his errand. <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>embraced him, giving thanks with joy, and asked
<lb/>about <placeName>Iran</placeName>, the imperial throne, <persName>Gudarz</persName>,

<lb/>and <persName>Rustam</persName>, lover of the fray. <persName>Giv</persName> said :—
<lb/><q>O royal world-lord, noble, fortunate,

<lb/>and wise! were God, who <sic>knoweth</sic> good and ill,
<lb/>to give to me the whole of Paradise,

<lb/>the seven climes and sovereign sway withal,
<lb/>the seat of greatness and the crown of might,
<lb/>my heart would not exult therein so much

<lb/>as in beholding thy face in <placeName>Turan</placeName>.

<lb/>Who <sic>knoweth</sic> in <placeName>Iran</placeName> if I am living,

<lb/>or if I have been laid in dust or burned,

<lb/>or have encountered <persName>Siyawush</persName> alive,

<lb/>thanks be to God that fate <sic>determineth</sic>

<lb/>Together they departed from the wood
<lb/>while <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> asked after Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>about <persName>Giv</persName>’s seven years of grief and pain,
<lb/>his lodging, sleep, and food. <persName>Giv</persName> answered all,
<lb/>and spake about the purpose of the Lord,
<lb/>the vision of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, his own long toil,
<lb/>his victuals, clothes, and rest, his pains and pleasures ;
<lb/>how years had spent the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>and how he was distracted for his son;
<lb/>how all was dark and scentless in his palace,
<lb/>and 2 ow the desolation was complete.
<lb/>The heart of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> burned at these woes,
<lb/>his two cheeks flamed like fire. He said to <persName>Giv</persName>:—
<lb/><q>Fate giveth thee for travail rest and ease ;

<lb/>to any one, and note what time will bring.</q>

<lb/>and that brave warrior preceded him

<lb/>and leave not one of us, at large or hiding,

<lb/>Hear mine advice, my son endowed with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> !
<lb/>There is a meadow near out of the track

<lb/>of <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> cavaliers; be there at dawn,

<lb/>and have this saddle and black bridle with thee.
<lb/>Thou wilt behold a mountain whereupon
<lb/>clouds fret their faces. Having scaled the height
<lb/>thou wilt behold the mead like <sic>jocund</sic> spring,
<lb/>all rivulets and <sic>purling</sic> streams: the soul
<lb/>Reviveth at the sight. When it is noon,

<lb/>and thou art eager for repose, the herds

<lb/>at pasture there will water at the streams.
<lb/>Show to <rs type="horse">Bihzad</rs> the saddle and the bridle,

<lb/>and, if he <sic>proveth</sic> tractable, advance,

<lb/>go quickly to him, let him see thy face,

<lb/>caress him with thy hand and speak to him.
<lb/>When <persName>Siyawush</persName> had given up all hope

<lb/>of this world, and his day was turned to night,
<lb/>he spake thus to <rs type="horse">Bihzad</rs> his sable steed :—

<lb/><q> Be thou henceforth free as the wind itself.
<lb/>Remain upon the mountains and the meadows,
<lb/>and when Khusrau shall come in quest of thee
<lb/>be thou his charger, tramp the whole world thro’,
<lb/>and sweep the earth of <sic>foemen</sic> with thy shoe.</q></q>

<lb/>The valiant chieftain mounted on his steed
<lb/>with <persName>Giv</persName> in front on foot. They set their faces

<lb/>toward the heights as men who seek for safety.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.722"/>

<lb/>Now when the herds came down to watering,

<pb n="375"/>

<lb/>and having drunk their fill turned to depart,

<lb/>illustrious Khusrau went hastily

<lb/>toward the stream and, to attain his wish,

<lb/>showed to <rs type="horse">Bihzad</rs> the saddle and the reins.

<lb/>The steed looked at him, recognised a master,

<lb/>and stirred not from the stream, but gazed with sighs

<lb/>upon the <sic>pard</sic>-skin seat of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>the lengthy stirrups, and the poplar saddle.

<lb/>This <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> observed and hurried up.

<lb/>Meanwhile the noble black stood still and wept.

<lb/>Moreover <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName> wept too,

<lb/>as though they had been burning in fierce flame,

<lb/>and while they shed tears from their eyes their <sic>tongucs</sic>

<lb/>were full of curses on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.

<lb/>Khusrau caressed the horse’s eyes and face,

<lb/>stroked down his chest and shoulders, scratched his hide,

<lb/>put o’er his head the bridle, saddled him,

<lb/>and spake the while with grief of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>then mounting gripped his legs; the mighty beast

<lb/>sped like a blast out of the sight of <persName>Giv</persName>,

<lb/>who troubled and amazed invoked God’s name.

<lb/><q> This,</q> he exclaimed, <q>is subtle <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>

<lb/>appearing in the likeness of a horse!

<lb/>The prince’s life is lost and my toil too,

<lb/>my toil—the only treasure that I had!</q>

<lb/>When <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> had traversed half the mountain
<lb/>he drew his black reins and remained till <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>o’<sic>ertook</sic> him, then the shrewd and valiant prince
<lb/>exclaimed: <q>Shall I inform the paladin
<lb/>what I perceived was passing in his thoughts ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> said to him: <q>O most exalted prince!
<lb/>All secrets should be open unto thee :

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.723"/>
<lb/>thou with thy <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> divine and <rs type="ethnic">Kaian</rs> stature 
<lb/>canst penetrate a hair and see within it.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He said: <q>Thou didst mistrust this noble steed,

<pb n="376"/>

<lb/>and think: <q>Now <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> hath got the youth,
<lb/>who hath gone off and turned my toil to wind:
<lb/>my spirit <sic>mourneth</sic> and the <sic>divs</sic> rejoice.</q></q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The veteran <persName>Giv</persName> dismounted from his horse,
<lb/>invoking blessing on the warrior-prince,
<lb/>and said: <q>May day and night be fortunate
<lb/>to thee, thy <sic>foemen</sic>’s hearts be rooted out,
<lb/>since God hath given to thee worth and birth,
<lb/>with throne and stature, state and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> divine.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>They left the heights, and set off toward the palace
<lb/>with brains absorbed in thought and scheming minds ;
<lb/>on reaching <persName>Farangis</persName> they much discussed
<lb/>the <sic>toilsome</sic> journey, and the way to keep
<lb/>the project secret. When she saw <rs type="horse">Bihzad</rs>
<lb/>her face was hidden by a flood of tears,
<lb/>she laid her cheek against his mane and chest,
<lb/>and called upon the soul of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>When she had wept she hurried to her hoards,
<lb/>for in the palace was a secret treasure—
<lb/>known but to her—of jewels and dinars,
<lb/>of iron <sic>maces</sic> and horse-furniture,
<lb/>as well as daggers, swords, and massive <sic>sparths</sic>.
<lb/>With cheeks that ran with tears of blood, and liver
<lb/>pierced by her grief, she showed her son the treasure,
<lb/>and said to <persName>Giv</persName>: <q>O veteran in toil!
<lb/>Choose what thou <sic>pleasest</sic> from this treasury—
<lb/>dinars and jewels fit for kings to wear,
<lb/>and crowns with patterns wrought in precious stones.
<lb/>We are the keepers and the hoard is thine;
<lb/>thine are the toil and risk.</q>

</p><milestone unit="vullers" n="V.724"/><p>
<lb/>He kissed the ground,

<lb/>and said: <q>O chief of dames! thou <sic>makest</sic> earth
<lb/>a Spring in Paradise, and, as thou <sic>willest</sic>,
<lb/>the sky <sic>apportioneth</sic> both good and ill.
<lb/>Be all the world a slave before thy son,
<lb/>and be the heads of all thy foes wrung off.</q></p>

<pb n="377"/>

<p>When <persName>Giv</persName>’s eye fell upon those precious things
<lb/>he chose the mail of valiant <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>They then selected all the choicest gems,
<lb/>and bare away as much as they could carry
<lb/>as well as helms, rich armour for the steeds,
<lb/>and weapons suited to a paladin,
<lb/>then having locked the hoard the prince in haste
<lb/>made ready for the journey through the waste.

</p><p>
<lb/>Thus went the brave young band

<lb/>commanded by two wary paladins.
</p><p>
<lb/>The persecuted prince and <persName>Farangis</persName>,
<lb/>worn out with journeying and nights of toil,
<lb/>had laid them down to sleep, and while they slept
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> stood on guard with angry eyes intent
<lb/>upon the road by which the band approached.
<lb/>He wore his <sic>habergeon</sic>; his helm was on;
<lb/>his heart was full; he was prepared to die;
<lb/>and, like a valiant chief, he had his steed
<lb/>Accoutred by his side in case of need.

<p>

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> saw afar the dust raised by the troops,

<lb/>and having drawn his sword sent up a shout
<lb/>like thunder, such a shout as would have dazed
<lb/>a lion’s brain and spirit, then he rushed

<lb/>like dust among the troop and made earth dark
<lb/>by combat. With his sword and mace he showered
<lb/>down iron from above, till by the blows

<lb/>the heads of all the chiefs grew sick of strife,
<lb/>while to his eyes, such were his pain and rage,

<lb/>a river seemed a rill, Anon they hemmed him—
<lb/>a raging Lion in a host of men.

<lb/>The field became a reed-bed with their spears,
<lb/>both sun and moon were hid, the Lion raged,
<lb/>and made a <sic>winefat</sic> of the bed of reeds

<lb/>with blood, o’<sic>erthrowing</sic> many of his foes:

<lb/>those valiant cavaliers were all astound,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.726"/>
<lb/>and thus <persName>Kulbad</persName> addressed brave <persName>Nastihan</persName> :—
<lb/><q>This is a rock of flint with neck and arms !

<lb/>See here the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> and not

<pb n="379"/>

<lb/>the mace of <persName>Giv</persName>! I know not what will come
<lb/>upon our fields and fells, for who can traverse
<lb/>the will of God? Astrologers presage
<lb/>disaster to <placeName>Turan</placeName> and to her lords.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>They made a charge at <persName>Giv</persName> with all their troops

<lb/>like lions, giving and receiving blows :

<lb/>the battle-shouts and blast of <sic>clarions</sic>

<lb/>went up and shook the mountains to their cores,
<lb/>the -alleys and the plains were filled with slain,
<lb/>and earth became like <sic>cercis</sic>-bloom with blood.
<lb/>The whole host turned away in flight from <persName>Giv</persName>—
<lb/>that noble chief, the refuge of the troops—

<lb/>and made their way all wounded and <sic>fordone</sic>

<lb/>to proud <persName>Piran</persName>, while gallant <persName>Giv</persName> returned,

<lb/>with breast and bands all bloody, like a lion

<lb/>to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, and said: <q>O prince! rejoice!
<lb/>May health be thine, and wisdom thy companion !
<lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName> and <persName>Nastihan</persName> the deft of hand

<lb/>have been pursuing us with hostile troops,

<lb/>and those that still survive have gone back home
<lb/>with necks and chests in case to ask our tears.

<lb/>I know not any horseman in <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>save <persName>Rustam</persName> able to encounter me.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Khusrau, pure in the Faith, rejoiced o’er <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>called blessings down on him, and praised him greatly ;
<lb/>they took some food, such as came first to hand,
<lb/>and hasted on toward the trackless waste.

</p><p>

<lb/>Now when the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> troops came to <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>so stricken, heated, and discomfited,

<lb/>he spake in anger to <persName>Kulbad</persName>, and said :-—

</p><p>

<lb/><q>This is a marvel which must not be hidden!
<lb/>What have ye done to <persName>Giv</persName>? Where is Khusrau ?
<lb/>How went the matter? Tell me honestly.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName> said: <q>If I tell, O paladin!
<lb/>What gallant <persName>Giv</persName> did to our warriors,
<lb/>thou wouldst no more of battles. Thou hast seen me

<pb n="380"/>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.727"/>
<lb/>oft with the host, and hast approved my prowess,
<lb/>yet when I charged him, thinking: <q> Now shall I
<lb/>behold his overthrow,</q> in sooth he bore
<lb/>above a thousand buffets of mine ax.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>His head is but an anvil,
<lb/>his chest and arms are solid ivory!</q>
<lb/>oft have I gazed on <persName>Rustam</persName> in the fight,
<lb/>and <sic>hearkened</sic> tales of mighty warriors,
<lb/>but never knew one so endure the blows,

<lb/>wax <sic>maces</sic>, and our horsemen <sic>pard</sic>-skin lances,
<lb/>no wonder had his shoulders, arms, and breast
<lb/>been pounded small. He kept his dash and keenness

<lb/>The plain was heaped with slain, our warriors
<lb/>were routed by one man!</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> was <sic>wroth</sic>;
<lb/><q> Enough,</q> he said, <q>'tis shame to tell the tale;
<lb/>such words as these are not for cavaliers,
<lb/>attempt no more to strive with men of war.
<lb/>Thou <sic>wentest</sic> forth with noble <persName>Nastihan</persName>,

<lb/><q> Your fleet steeds' reins, like savage lions go

<lb/>Thereat they raised their heads and hurried on

<lb/>they reached a narrow river, where the stream
<lb/>was deep and difficult for men to cross,

<lb/>that river which was called <placeName>Gulzaryun</placeName>,
<lb/>and was in <sic>springtide</sic> like a stream of blood.

</p><p>
<lb/>Upon the further bank the prince and <persName>Giv</persName>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.729"/>
<lb/>and looking round her from her post <sic>descried</sic> 
<lb/>the banner of the leader of <placeName>Turan</placeName>!

<lb/>She ran to <persName>Giv</persName>, gave the alarm, and roused

<lb/>the sleepers, crying: <q> Man of toil! arise !

"Tis time to flee, a host <sic>pursueth</sic> us.

<lb/>Our time, I fear, is come. If they shall take thee
<lb/>they will not leave thee living and will rack

<lb/>The conquering Lord of earth is mine ally,

<lb/>The chief was on this side, the host on that ;

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> roared out like a thunderclap in spring,
<lb/>inquiring for the captain of the host.

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> was <sic>wroth</sic>, upbraided <persName>Giv</persName>, and said :—
<lb/><q>Thou miscreant by nature and descent !
<lb/>Com’st thou alone so <sic>hardily</sic> to face

<lb/>an army? Thou shalt taste two-headed javelins,
<lb/>while falcons' talons shall provide thy bier.
<lb/>Thou art a single horseman, iron mountain

<pb n="383"/>

<lb/>although thou be. A thousand will surround thee

<lb/>like ants, will smash the armour on thy breast,

<lb/>and drag thy carrion-carcase in the dust.

<lb/>The mighty lion springing spake this saw :—

<lb/><q>Whene’er the stag hath reached its destined day

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.731"/>
<lb/>fate <sic>reckoneth</sic> each breath drawn by the prey
<lb/>till it shall cross a lion on the way.</q>

<lb/>so fortune now hath brought thee in my path

<lb/>here in the presence of this famous host.</q>
</p><p>

<lb/>Brave <persName>Giv</persName>, that chief of mighty paladins,
<lb/>replied in thunder-tones: <q>Thou miscreant <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>
<lb/>of <sic>divs</sic> begotten! perish chiefs like thee !

<lb/>Thou <sic>sawest</sic> my revenge for <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>and hadst good reason to admire my prowess,
<lb/>for many chieftains of <placeName>Turan</placeName> and <placeName>Chin</placeName>

<lb/>fell by my hand in battle. I it was

<lb/>who ravaged all thy home and wrecked thy life.
<lb/>Thy two chief dames were in the company

<lb/>that I dragged off in bondage from <placeName>Khutan</placeName>,
<lb/>thy sister one, the other was thy spouse,

<lb/>who ever tendered thee both soul and body.
<lb/>When I beheld those wretched <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> dames
<lb/>I gave them to the meanest of my slaves,

<lb/>while thou didst show thy back as women would,
<lb/>and run away with shrieks and doleful howls.
<lb/>For thee mankind should fight like womankind ;
<lb/>brag not of bravery to warriors,

<lb/>for chiefs shall sing hereafter to thy shame
<lb/>how <persName>Giv</persName> unaided carried off Khusrau,

<lb/>and all shall hold your names to be disgraced.
<lb/>Again, while all the princes of the earth—

<lb/>the nobles and the kin of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>,

<lb/>brave men and warriors with golden <sic>casques</sic>—

<pb n="384"/>

<lb/>met him with scorn, and put their offer by
<lb/>because they were unworthy. Afterward,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.732"/>
<lb/>when he had looked throughout the world in vain,
<lb/>he gave his favourite daughter to myself—
<lb/>a daughter whom he prized above his crown.
<lb/>That high exalted and most noble prince
<lb/>gave me the horsewoman <persName>Banugashasp</persName>,

<lb/>his eldest daughter, chose me of all lords,
<lb/>and raised my head to heaven. I gave my sister,

<lb/>to him. Excepting elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<lb/>the lion-man, I do not know my match,

<lb/>and when I come with him to take revenge
<lb/>ye must make ready to bewail your dead.
<lb/>Now with this steel-blue <sic>falchion</sic> will I turn
<lb/>the world before your eyes as black as pitch,
<lb/>and if I leave one of your host alive

<lb/>give to me never more the name of man.
<lb/>Iranward bear I royal <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>

<lb/>to bring him to the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>to seat him on the famous ivory throne,

<lb/>and place upon his head the glorious crown.
<lb/>Then will I don again this precious mail,

<lb/>and make <placeName>Turan</placeName> the lair of mighty lions.
<lb/>Son am I to <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>;

<lb/>afar from stream and host, flung mace on saddle
<lb/>and charged <q>like dragon raging,</q> thou hadst said.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> the Lion fled pursued by <persName>Giv</persName>,

<lb/>The sun turned dark before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>

<lb/>and <sic>tymbal</sic>, called to horse and went like fire.
<lb/>In haste he made two stages into one,
<lb/>and sped forth like an arrow from the bow,
<lb/>arriving at the place whereat <persName>Kulbad</persName>
<lb/>had fought he saw troops scattered o’er the land,
<lb/>while everywhere lay bodies of the fallen.
<lb/>He asked: <q>How came this paladin with troops
<lb/>here from iran? None of our warriors
<lb/>knew of a mighty army coming thence.
<lb/>Who told those sons of <sic>divs</sic> that <persName>Siyawush</persName>

<lb/>The king amazed and pained asked what it meant.
<lb/>Then said <persName>Piran</persName>: <q>No ravening wolf or tiger,

<lb/>or savage lion, is like <persName>Giv</persName> in battle,

<lb/>although alone. The fear of fighting him

<lb/>would make a crocodile burn under water.

<lb/>He first attacked us with a massive mace,

<lb/>and dealt us blows as with a blacksmith’s hammer.
<lb/>By dint of steed and dexterous horsemanship

<lb/>he overthrew, smote down our cavaliers,

<lb/>and slaughtered them at will, yet cloud ne’er rained
<lb/>more drops than sword-strokes fell upon his head !
<lb/>In sooth his saddle was no bed of roses;

<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>He is a mountain’s match.</q>
<lb/>at last our troops all turned and I alone

<lb/>remained to fight with him. He fled from me,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.739"/>

<lb/>but threw his twisted lasso, and my waist 
<lb/>was taken in its coils. I lost my head,

<lb/>and fell with all my weight upon the ground.

<lb/>He lighted from his charger, bound my hands.
<lb/>And then <sic>remounting</sic> <sic>drave</sic> me on before him.<ref target="n.389.1"/>
<lb/>he carried me in shame to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,

<lb/>and would have had my head, but <persName>Farangis</persName>

<lb/>came to mine aid; he spared my life but pierced
<lb/>mine ear, and in a fury bound my hands,

<lb/>then by the Shah’s own life and head, by sun

<lb/>and moon, by God Almighty, crown and throne,
<lb/>proposed to me a mighty oath, and I,

<lb/>since I saw fortune hostile, duly swore

<lb/>that nobody should loose me but my wife,

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> on hearing wept for rage,

<lb/>and lifting up his voice <sic>drave</sic> forth <persName>Piran</persName>,

<lb/>who writhing as he was made no reply.

<lb/>Then blustering and cursing swore the king :—

<lb/><q> Though <persName>Giv</persName> and that <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s child were thunder-clouds

<lb/>or storm-winds I would make them fall from heaven.

<lb/>With this,</q> he drew his sword, <q>this iron-<sic>piercer</sic>,

<lb/>will I in vengeance rob them both of breath,

<lb/>and as for <persName>Farangis</persName> will make the world

</p><p>
<lb/>He lighted, groaned, fell prostrate in the dust,

<lb/>Thy <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> for good or ill <sic>sufficeth</sic> me ;

<lb/>He spake, and radiant as.the morning star

<lb/>Thus all three safely gained the other side,

<lb/>and when so great and puissant a prince

<lb/>Requireth thee to furnish him a boat

<lb/>Refusest! Perish all thine offerings !

<lb/>A day will come when thou wilt think of this.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The river-warden went off in chagrin,

<lb/>the army from <placeName>Turan</placeName> was at the toll-house.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, not seeing man or boat
<lb/>upon the stream, cried fiercely to the toll-man :—
<lb/><q> How found that div his way across the water ?</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The man replied: <q>O king! my father took
<lb/>the toll as I do, yet I never saw
<lb/>or heard of one who made the water land.

<lb/>In springtime when the waves are running high

<lb/>if thou dost enter there is no escape,

<lb/>yet those three riders crossed! Thou wouldst have said :—

<lb/><q>The air supported them upon its breast,</q>

<lb/>or, <q> They are children of the rushing wind—

<lb/>the messengers dispatched by God to man,</q></q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> on hearing this turned pale,

<lb/>see if thou canst discern the fugitives,

<lb/>that I may take them prisoners. Make dispatch,

<lb/>Then said <persName>Human</persName> to him: <q>O king! consider,

<lb/>most men rejoiced but certain were displeased.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> sent out messengers to every part,

<lb/>hath come rejoicing from <placeName>Turan</placeName>.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He chose
<lb/>among the chiefs of <placeName>Zam</placeName> a messenger,
<lb/>a valiant cavalier, wise, shrewd, and prudent,
<lb/>informed him of the case, and said to him :-—
<lb/><q>Depart hence unto <placeName>Ispahan</placeName>—the land ,

<pb n="395"/>

<lb/>of Shahs, the habitation of the mighty—
<lb/>and tell <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q>O chief of paladins !
<lb/>Thy mind was not asleep when thou didst dream.</q>
<lb/>then add this: <q><persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> hath come to <placeName>Zam</placeName>,
<lb/>and not a blast hath done him injury.</q></q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He wrote a letter unto Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<lb/>The messenger arose and went his way.
<lb/>The wind-foot camels with their lips <sic>afoam</sic>
<lb/>rushed onward fire-like. First he sought <persName>Gudarz</persName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.745"/>
<lb/>declared the message, and gave up to him 
<lb/>the letter, which the paladin in chief
<lb/>placed to his head with tears for <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>and <sic>maledictions</sic> on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>The messenger went on to <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>
<lb/>while drops of sweat fell from the camels' necks.
<lb/>When he approached the palace-gate a shout
<lb/>of gladness rose, the monarch gave him audience,
<lb/>and sprinkled jewels over <persName>Giv</persName>’s dispatch.
<lb/>They decked the whole world in their happiness,
<lb/>they called for minstrels everywhere, while <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>when tidings of <persName>Giv</persName>’s triumph reached <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>,
<lb/>gave gold in <sic>largess</sic> to the <sic>mendicants</sic>
<lb/>because that Lion had received no hurt;

<lb/>like lightning, bearing treasures, and with her
<lb/>twelve hundred mighty men of name with gifts
<lb/>of thrones and heavy crowns, three hundred damsels,
<lb/>and six score youths, all bearing golden goblets.
<lb/>The lady left her sire and went to <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>as swiftly as a bird upon the wing,
<lb/>while news spread everywhere : <q>The monarch’s son,
<lb/>the young prince <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, is on his way.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>As for the men of leading in the world
<lb/>they all resorted unto <placeName>Ispahan</placeName>.
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> prepared his stately residence,
<lb/>and draped it with imperial brocade,

<pb n="396"/>

<lb/>prepared a throne with gold and jewelry,

<lb/>such as must needs be worthy of the Shah,

<lb/>and <sic>armlets</sic>, torques, and earrings with a crown

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.746"/>
<lb/>of royal gems. He had the city decked,

<lb/>prepared the Ground, and mounted on his steed.

<lb/>The illustrious chiefs arose and, all being ready,

<lb/>went forward seventy leagues to meet the prince

<lb/>upon the road according to their custom.

<lb/>As soon as <persName>Giv</persName> appeared with <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>

<lb/>the valiant cavaliers advanced on foot.

<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> the chieftain when he saw the prince,

<lb/>accompanied by <persName>Giv</persName> upon the road,

<lb/>shed tears of gall and in his deep distress

<lb/>spake much in memory of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.

<lb/>The paladin then lighted from his steed,

<lb/>and clasped the youthful monarch to his breast,

<lb/>paid him high compliments, did reverence,

<lb/>and said to him: <q>O monarch of the earth !

<lb/>Be bright in fortune and be bright in heart ;

<lb/>I would not lose thee for a realm or throne.

<lb/>Far from thee be thy <sic>foeman</sic>’s evil eye,

<lb/>and may the soul of <persName>Siyawush</persName> be bright.

<lb/>God is my witness that to see thee <sic>lengtheneth</sic>

<lb/>my life. If I saw <persName>Siyawush</persName> alive

<lb/>I should not laugh so from the heart as now.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>He kissed the head and eyes of <persName>Giv</persName> and said :—

<lb/><q>Thou hast revealed a very heaven to us.

<lb/>Thou art no sluggard but a warrior;

<lb/>yet on occasion thou canst bide thy time.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>Then all the mighty warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>bent down their faces to the ground before him,

<lb/>and as they turned back on their way rejoicing

<lb/>the fortunes of those haughty men grew bright.

<lb/>They reached the palace of the paladin,

<lb/>When <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> appeared before the Shah 
<lb/>the world was filled with colour, scent, and beauty,
<lb/>and everywhere in festal trim. The doors,

<lb/>the roofs, and walls were full of precious things,
<lb/>while minstrels had been stationed in all quarters,
<lb/>and there were wine, rose-water, musk, and saffron.
<lb/>The horses' manes were drenched with musk and wine,
<lb/>while sweets and <sic>drachms</sic> were scattered under foot.
<lb/>The tears coursed down the cheeks of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>

<lb/>when he beheld the visage of Khusrau.

<lb/>He came down from his throne, approached the prince,
<lb/>and with his face caressed the prince’s head

<lb/>and eyes. The youthful <sic>atheling</sic> did homage,

<lb/>and then they paced back to the throne together.

<lb/>The Shah inquired at large about the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>,

<lb/>and how the ruler of that people fared.

<lb/>The prince replied: <q>That man of little wit

<lb/>still <sic>walketh</sic> on the face of earth for ill.

<lb/>Why doth the Shah inquire about that wretch ?

<lb/>May pleasure, crown, and throne be never his!

<lb/>He slew my father vilely, shamefully,

<lb/>and beat my mother with harsh blows that I

<lb/>might perish in the womb! May he ne’er scape

<lb/>from woe! As soon as my pure mother bare me

<lb/>that miscreant dispatched me to the mountains,
<lb/>among the cattle, goats, and buffaloes,

<lb/>I reckoned by the sun my nights and days.

<lb/>At length <persName>Piran</persName> arrived, and from the heights

<pb n="398"/>

<lb/>conducted me to that vindictive king.

<lb/>I trembled at his rage and savagery,

<lb/>afraid of what might come. He asked me questions,
<lb/>while I concealed what wit and worth I had.

<lb/>If he inquired of heads I spake of feet,

<lb/>if he inquired of food I talked of place.

<lb/>God took away his sense and intellect,

<lb/>and so the dullard took me for a fool,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.748"/>
<lb/>conceived <sic>iny</sic> head to be ill stocked with brains,
<lb/>and sent me to my mother with a curse.</q>

<lb/>Khusrau said: <q>Monarch of this ancient throne !
<lb/>If I should give thee an account of <persName>Giv</persName>,

<lb/>and what hath been accomplished by his hands,
<lb/>the Shah would wonder, and no marvel too,
<lb/>because it <sic>passeth</sic> bounds. Full many a hardship
<lb/>did he endure, and sought me in <placeName>Turan</placeName>

<lb/>with strivings, yet he bore not toils so great

<lb/>as those which followed in my company,

<lb/>for then two noble paladins with troops

<lb/>came after us like fire upon the road.

<lb/>Idolater of Hindustan <sic>beholdeth</sic>

<lb/>no maddened elephant do what I saw

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> do. Methought: <q>No crocodile will come
<lb/>forth from the streams to fight thus!</q> That great host,
<lb/>and those two paladins, were seized with panic—
<lb/>both old and young alike—and afterward,

<lb/>what time <persName>Piran</persName> came boldly with girt loins
<lb/>upon a wind-foot steed, <persName>Giv</persName> flung his lasso

<lb/>and caught the paladin. I interceded,

<lb/>o king! for him, else <persName>Giv</persName> had ruthlessly

<lb/>struck off his head. Know that <persName>Piran</persName> had suffered
<lb/>through anguish for my sire, had never spoken

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.749"/>

<lb/>aught ill of me, and saved me and withal

<pb n="399"/>

<lb/>my mother from the fierce, grim Lion’s claws,
<lb/>who else had ta’en my head just like my father's.
<lb/>Thus till we reached the banks of the <placeName>Jihun</placeName>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> with his ox-head mace ceased not from combat.
<lb/>A paladin like him should keep his youth

</p><p>
<lb/>When <persName>Kaus</persName> had heard Khusrau

<lb/>his cheeks bloomed like arose. He clasped <persName>Giv</persName>’s head,
<lb/>and kissed his face and bosom many times,
<lb/>then gave him presents such as in the world

<lb/>They wrote a patent out on painted silk

<lb/>The prince, whose <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> divine was as <persName>Jamshid</persName>’s,
<lb/>gave these to <persName>Giv</persName>, whose head rose to the sun.
<lb/><q> Thou hast,</q> the Shah said, <q>undergone much toil,

<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> and all his sons with faces laid

<lb/>The messenger is <persName>Giv</persName>, the words are mine,

<lb/>and sanctioned by the nobles here assembled.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> left the presence of his sire with words

<lb/>of anger in his heart. On reaching <persName>Tus</persName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.751"/>
<lb/>he said: <q>Thy <sic>rede</sic> and wisdom are not mates.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> hearing that replied: <q>It is not good

<lb/>to play off tricks on me, for in <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>save elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>, I am first

<lb/>among the chieftains that command the host,

<lb/>and grandson of the valiant <persName>Minuchihr</persName>,

<lb/>the Shah who with his sword subdued the world.

<lb/><persName>Naudar</persName> my father was the king of earth,

<lb/>I represent the race of <persName>Faridun</persName>.

<lb/>Whenever I engage myself in fight

<lb/>I rend the lion’s heart and leopard’s hide.

<lb/>Ye have, without my counsel and consent,

<lb/>established a new monarch in the world:

<pb n="401"/>

<lb/>I will not be a party to this thing,
<lb/>so talk not in my presence of Khusrau.
<lb/>If from the offspring of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>we make a king, then will our fortunes sleep.
<lb/>We want no Shah descended from <persName>Pashang</persName> ;
<lb/>a flock is ill entrusted to a leopard.
<lb/>This is the <sic>fruitage</sic> of these toils of thine,
<lb/>for <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> is young and violent,
<lb/>while he that <sic>ruleth</sic> earth should have high lineage,
<lb/>worth, Faith, and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>. Now <persName>Fariburz</persName>, the son
<lb/>of Shah <persName>Kaus</persName>, is worthier of crown
<lb/>and throne, not sprung from foes on either side,
<lb/>but having <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and glory, fame and right.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>Then <persName>Giv</persName> arose in dudgeon, doubting both
<lb/>the wisdom and the honesty of <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>and said: <q>O <persName>Tus</persName>, illustrious warrior!
<lb/>Withdraw not when the drums sound. When thou <sic>seest</sic>
<lb/>the spear-heads of the kindred of <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>the gain that thou <sic>expectest</sic> will prove loss.
<lb/>The many toils that we have borne together
<lb/>thou <sic>throwest</sic> to the winds. Hadst thou the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>
<lb/>and counsel we had sought not from <placeName>Alburz</placeName>
<lb/>a monarch; and thy head hath not the crown
<lb/>because thou <sic>lackest</sic> brains and royal <sic>rede</sic>;

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.752"/>
<lb/>god doth bestow the throne of sovereignty 
<lb/>on one who hath the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, mien, sense, and counsel.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He spake thus wrathfully and showed his back
<lb/>in anger; thence returning to <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>he said: <q> <persName>Tus</persName> is no mate for <sic>rede</sic> and wisdom.
<lb/>Thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say: <q> His eyes are blind.</q> His choice
<lb/>is <persName>Fariburz</persName>, although no sovereign
<lb/>on golden saddle is our prince’s peer,
<lb/>nor have we such another cavalier.</q>

<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> was full of wrath and said: <q> May <persName>Tus</persName>

<lb/>cease from among the nobles of the world.

<lb/>Now will we let him see to whom belong

<lb/>the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, the sovereign sway, throne, state, and fortune.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>His sons and grandsons numbered seventy-eight.
<lb/>He beat the drums and marched forth from the palace
<lb/>out to the open with twelve thousand men
<lb/>of his own kin, brave troops on <sic>barded</sic> steeds,

<lb/>led by himself, that <sic>shatterer</sic> of hosts.

<lb/>Upon the other side came <persName>Tus</persName>, the chieftain,

<lb/>and bound the drums upon the elephants,

<lb/>while many warriors girded up their loins,

<lb/>and <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard led the central host.

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> saw <persName>Gudarz</persName> with such a multitude

<lb/>as dazed the eyes of sun and moon, he saw

<lb/>a mighty elephant which bore a throne

<lb/>of turquoise as resplendent as the <placeName>Nile</placeName>.

<lb/>Upon it sat the aspiring <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,

<lb/>with loins girt up and crown upon his head,


<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.753"/>

<lb/>surrounded by ten score huge elephants ;

<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>The world hath not a Shah
<lb/>save him.</q> Khusrau shone <sic>moonlike</sic> on the throne,
<lb/>with earrings, torque, and <sic>armlets</sic>, on his head

<lb/>a crown of glittering gems, and in his hand

<lb/>an <sic>oxhead</sic> mace. <persName>Tus</persName> thought with saddened heart :—
<lb/><q>If I shall fight to-day there will be slain

<lb/>a multitude of warriors in both hosts.

<lb/>This feud shall not arise within <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<lb/>for naught would better please <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,

<lb/>anc our prosperity be at an end.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>He sent a man of wisdom and resource
<lb/>to Shah <persName>Kaus</persName> to say: <q>If any here

<lb/>upon his bow there will arise a fight

<p>

<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName>, on hearing these wise words, dispatched
<lb/>a messenger to summon both the chiefs.
<lb/>He went before the captain of each host,
<lb/>and mildly said : <q> Experienced veteran !
<lb/>Put not fell poison in a cup of milk,
<lb/>replace thy sword, and loose thy <sic>girdlestead</sic> ;
<lb/>this gain of ours must not be turned to loss.
<lb/>Let both the captains of the hosts appear
<lb/>before me and without a retinue.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>They went before the Shah and <persName>Tus</persName> spake thus :—
<lb/><q>If now the Shah is weary of the crown
<lb/>and throne, his son should have the world, the might,
<lb/>the diadem, and throne of majesty.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.754"/>
<lb/>Why should a grandson, when there is a son, 
<lb/>put on the crown and sit upon the throne ?
<lb/>Now <persName>Fariburz</persName> hath <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and royal mien,
<lb/>and <sic>girdeth</sic> him as '<sic>twere</sic> a savage lion.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> replied : <q>O thou of little wit!
<lb/>No sage would reckon thee to be a man.
<lb/>None in the world hath equalled <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>or been so great, discreet, and reticent.
<lb/>Now this aspirant is a son of his,
<q>The same,</q> thou <sic>wouldest</sic> say, <q>in face and form,</q>
<lb/>if on his mother’s side he is from <persName>Tur</persName>

<pb n="404"/>

<lb/>the grandson of the Shah must still prove just.
<lb/>There is not in <placeName>Iran</placeName> or in <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>one like him: to what end is thy crude talk ?
<lb/>Thine eyes have never even seen his face,
<lb/>his lofty mien, and <sic>lovingkindliness</sic>,
<lb/>he crossed <placeName>Jihun</placeName> and needed not a boat,
<lb/>such were his royal <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and steadfast purpose.
<lb/>As with Shah <persName>Faridun</persName>, who crossed the <placeName>Arwand</placeName>
<lb/>without a boat, his courage and God’s <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>
<lb/>preserved him from the hand and eye of ill.
<lb/>Moreover, to avenge his father’s blood,
<lb/>he like a savage lion <sic>girdeth</sic> him
<lb/>to banish toil and trouble from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and over-reach astute <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Surtsh the glorious said to me in sleep :—
<lb/><q>His <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> will still the war-cry in <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>and when he shall adorn the crown and throne
<lb/>of chiefs, the world will cease from toil and hardship.</q>
<lb/>thou art no alien; thou art from <persName>Naudar</persName>:
<lb/>thy father was perverse and thou art mad.
<lb/>Had I my weapons I would <sic>drench</sic> thy neck
<lb/>and breast in blood, would slay thee with my sword,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.755"/>

<lb/>and end thy silly talk. Thou <sic>makest</sic> discord
<lb/>among the Kaians for thy selfish ends.
<lb/>The king of kings <sic>acknowledgeth</sic> Khusrau,
<lb/>and will bestow the throne on whom he will.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> said: <q>O ancient chief! what rancorous words!
<lb/>Though thou art from <persName>Kishwad</persName> yet I am <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>son of <persName>Naudar</persName>, a Shah and a Shah’s son,
<lb/>and if thy sword will penetrate an anvil
<lb/>my spear will rend the centre of Mount <placeName>Kaf</placeName>.

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.756"/>

<lb/>What <sic>booteth</sic> wordy war betwixt us twain ?
<lb/>The king of kings doth know who is the chief.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> replied to him: <q>Talk not so much ;
<lb/>I see not that thy glory is so great.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Then said he to <persName>Kaus</persName>: <q> Experienced Shah !

<pb n="405"/>

<lb/>turn not from rule and custom, call before thee
<lb/>the noble youths, and let thy clear mind judge ;
<lb/>discern between them which is worthier
<lb/>as having royal mien and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> divine,
<lb/>and give to him the crown and throne if thou
<lb/>art weary of the crown and host thyself.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/><persName>Kaus</persName> replied to him: <q> This is not well,
<lb/>for both alike are dear; when I have chosen
<lb/>one then the other will seek vengeance on me.
<lb/>I will take means that this may not betide
<lb/>among our folk. Let both, each with a host,

<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>, contented with the plan

<lb/>while <persName>Tus</persName> went first with troops and elephants.
<lb/>When he drew near the castle of <persName>Bahman</persName>
<lb/>the ground seemed breathing fire, the lances' points
<lb/>flamed in the heat, the men of war were scorched
<lb/>beneath their mail. Thou hadst said: <q>Earth is burning,

<lb/>The ramparts rose to heaven; none knew a way

<lb/>He donned his mail, shouts rose, the world’s new lord 
<lb/>Khusrau came forth. They set a golden throne,
<lb/>inlaid with emeralds, on an elephant ;
<lb/>around the prince were warlike cavaliers
<lb/>with flags of violet, with golden boots,
<lb/>with crowns of amber, and with torques of gold
<lb/>adorned with divers gems. <persName>Gudarz</persName> thus spake :—
<lb/><q>This is the first of days, for <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>the <sic>atheling</sic>, <sic>accedeth</sic> to the throne.</q>

</p><p>
<lb/>The <sic>atheling</sic> sat on the golden seat,
<lb/>crowned and with mace in hand; he with <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, and a numerous host went toward the castle.
<lb/>When near the hold he girded up his loins,
<lb/>put on his mail, and, mounted on his charger,
<lb/>dictated to a scribe in lofty terms
<lb/>a letter, which they wrote in royal style
<lb/>with <sic>ambergris</sic>, and in the olden tongue :—
<lb/><q>This letter cometh from the Almighty’s slave—
<lb/>from noble <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> the <sic>atheling</sic>,
<lb/>who, freed from wicked <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>’s constraint,
<lb/>hath cleansed his hands from ill by help of God,
<lb/>who is eternally the Lord most high,
<lb/>the Giver of our daily bread, our Guide,
<lb/>the Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs>, of <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>, and the Sun,
<lb/>the Lord of <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, the Lord of puissance,
<lb/>who gave the throne and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of kings to me,
<lb/>fierce lion’s claws and elephantine bulk.
<lb/>The whole world is my kingdom ; all is mine
<lb/>from <rs type="heavenlybody">Pisces</rs> downward to the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bull</rs>’s head. Now
<lb/>if this hold be of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>’s domain,
<lb/>the enemy of Him who made the world,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.760"/>
<lb/>I by the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, and Holy God's command, 
<lb/>wilt cast it headlong from the clouds to dust;
<lb/>and if it is a hold of sorcerers
<lb/>I can dispose of them without a host,

<pb n="408"/>

<lb/>for when I have looped up my leathern lasso
<lb/>I take the heads of sorcerers in the noose;
<lb/>while if the blest <rs type="divinity">Surush</rs> himself is there
<lb/>the host is one at the command of God.
<lb/>I am not of the seed. of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>;
<lb/>my soul hath <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, my body lofty stature ;
<lb/>by God’s command I will reduce the castle,
<lb/>such are the orders of the king of kings.</q>


</p><p>

<lb/>Khusrau then took a lengthy lance and fixed
<lb/>thereto the haughty letter banner-wise ;
<lb/>he asked for naught on earth but royal <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,
<lb/>and ordered <persName>Giv</persName> to hasten with the spear
<lb/>up to the lofty ramparts, saying thus :—

</p><p>
<lb/><q>Take thou this letter of admonishment,
<lb/>and bear it to yon lofty castle's wall ;
<lb/>plant there the spear, call on the name of God,
<lb/>then quickly turn thy rein and hurry back.</q>

</p><p>

<lb/>That worshipper of God, that glorious chief,
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, took the spear in hand and went his way.
<lb/>He set the letter by the wall, delivered
<lb/>the message of Khusrau, pronounced the name
<lb/>of God who giveth good, and fled like wind.
<lb/>That noble letter vanished with a crash,
<lb/>dust flew, and by command of Holy God
<lb/>the rampart of the stronghold split asunder ;
<lb/>thou wouldst have said: <q>It <sic>thundereth</sic> as in spring.</q>
<lb/>A shout went up from plain and mountain-top,
<lb/>the earth became black as a negro’s face,
<lb/>sun, Moon, and Pleiades were lost to sight,
<lb/>and thou hadst said: <q>A murky cloud <sic>ariseth</sic>,
<lb/>the air is like a mighty lion’s maw.</q>

<lb/>Then <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> urged on his sable steed,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="V.761"/>
<lb/><q> Make arrows rain in showers upon the hold,
<lb/>and let your bows be like a cloud in spring.</q>

<lb/>Immediately a cloud rose charged with hail,

<lb/>Upon the spot where darkness cleared and light

<lb/>It was ten <sic>lassos</sic> long and broad, its circuit

</p><p>
<lb/>If then thy heart <sic>alloweth</sic> thee be glad,
<lb/>ensue but pleasure while it may be had,
</p><p>
<lb/>Provide thee well and give the rest away,
<lb/>and suffer not one moment to be sad.

<pb n="412"/>


<lb/>enjoy thy wealth and be not niggardly,
<lb/>but share not earnings with thine enemy ;

<lb/>god gave to thee and will give to thy child—
<lb/>that sucker springing from the parent tree.
</p><p>
<lb/>Perceivest not how fully earth is stored

<lb/>with wealth and furnished with good things? The Lord
<lb/>Abateth nothing in His <sic>bounteousness</sic> :

<lb/>abstain from sorrow and let joy be toward.
