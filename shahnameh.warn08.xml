<head>PART V: 
THE FALL AND RESTORATION TO FAVOUR
OF BUZURJMIHR, AND THE WISDOM OF
NUSHIRWAN</head>

<div>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>

<p>Buzurjmihr, while in attendance upon the Shah during a hunting-expedition, has a premonition of coming trouble and immediately afterwards falls under the Shah’s displeasure, and is disgraced. Conscious of his own rectitude he refuses to own that he is in fault and is treated with increasing rigour till the Shah has need of his services to expound a problem proposed by Caesar, but with his sight greatly impaired by his sufferings.</p>

<p>The rest of the Part is taken up with an account of the wisdom of Nushirwan as shown in his replies to questioners and in his letter of advice to his son Hurmuzd.</p>
</div><div>

<p>§4. It is manifest from the account in the Shahnama, and it is probably true historically, that Nushirwan did his best to provide himself with a worthy successor.<note n="1">Cf. NT. p. 252 and note.</note> In addition to this letter of counsel we have in Part VI. the account of the examination that his son Hurmuzd had to pass,<note n="2">p. 57.</note> and some final exhortations.<note n="3">p. 61.</note> Unfortunately</p>

<head>§1
How Nishirwan was wroth with Buzurjmihr and ordered him to be put in Ward</head>
<p>
<lb/>Consider now the case of Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Who from the dust rose to the circling sphere,
<lb/>Which will exalt one to the clouds on high,
<lb/>Then bring him down in sorry dust to lie <note n="1">Two couplets omitted.</note>
</p><p>
<lb/>It happened in those days that Nushirwan
<lb/>Went forth from Mada’in to hunt. He chased
<lb/>Along the wilderness the mountain-sheep
<lb/>And the gazelles. The mountain-sheep dispersed.
<lb/>The Shah was left behind with Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Who followed both from duty and from love.
<lb/>Then from the waste the monarch reached a meadow,
<lb/>And saw trees, grass, and shade. The weary Shah
<lb/>Alighted from his steed to rest his eyes
<lb/>Upon the grass. He saw no followers ;
<lb/>The one of goodly face remained, no more.
<lb/>The Shah reposed awhile upon the mead,
<lb/>His head right lovingly upon the lap
<lb/>Of Buzurjmihr. It was that wise king’s wont
<lb/>To wear a jewelled armlet. As it chanced
<lb/>This clinging armlet snapped upon his arm,
<lb/>And fell beside his couch. A sable bird
<lb/>Swooped from the clouds to where he lay, looked round,
</p><p>
<lb/>Beheld that armlet, brake the thread whereon
<lb/>The gems were strung, then ate them each in turn,
<lb/>The lustrous pearls and topazes alike,
<lb/>Flew from the monarch’s couch, and disappeared.
<lb/>At that adventure Buzurjmihr aghast
<lb/>Mused at the process of the turning sky.
</p><p>
<pb n="5"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>He understood: “My fall, my day of wrath,
<lb/>My season of dismay, are hard at hand!”
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah awoke, marked how he bit his lips,
<lb/>Scanned his own arm, beheld the jewels gone,
<lb/>And seeing no one of his escort there<note n="2">Couplet inserted from P.</note>
<lb/>Conceived that while he slumbered Buzurjmihr<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Had gulped the armlet down, and said to him:—
<lb/>“Thou dog! who said to thee: ‘’Tis possible
<lb/>To hide one’s natural bent?’”<note n="4">Couplet omitted.</note>
</p><p>
<lb/>But Nushirwan
</p><p>
<lb/>Fatigued with many words his tongue in vain;
<lb/>He got no answer but a deep, cold sigh,
<lb/>While Buzurjmihr stood withered by the Shah,
<lb/>And by the process of revolving heaven.
<lb/>That wise man marked at once the ominous sign
<lb/>Of downfall and remained struck dumb by fear.
<lb/>The escort of the Shah had gone about
<lb/>The mead while Nushirwan was in its midst.
<lb/>He mounted on his charger’s back in wrath,
<lb/>And noticed no one on his journey home,
<lb/>But bit his lip at Buzurjmihr the while,
<lb/>And muttering much alighted from his steed,
<lb/>Bade smite the sage’s face as ’twere an anvil,
<lb/>And to imprison him in his own palace.
<lb/>So Buzurjmihr abode there and beheld
<lb/>A frowning sky. He had a kinsman, brave
<lb/>And young, attending on Shah Nushirwan
<lb/>Within the palace day and night on terms
<lb/>Of intimacy. Buzurjmihr one day
<lb/>Asked that dependant of the sun-faced Shah:—
<lb/>“How dost thou wait upon him? Let me know
<lb/>So that thou mayest be more serviceable.”
</p><p>
<lb/>“Chief of archmages!” said the servitor,
<lb/>“It chanced this very day that Nushirwan
</p><p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1752"/>
<pb n="6"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>Looked so on me, his bondslave, that I said:—
<lb/>‘There is an end for me of food and sleep!’
<lb/>I poured the water for him after meat,
<lb/>Transgressing with the basin in the act,
<lb/>And when the world-lord was offended at me
<lb/>I let the basin fall.’ _
<lb/>Then said the sage:—
<lb/>‘Arise! Fetch hither water and pour out
<lb/>As thou wouldst pour it o’er the Shah's own hands.”
<lb/>The young man brought warm water which he poured
<lb/>Upon the sage’s hands with gentleness,
<lb/>Who said: “Pour thus when he requireth it,
<lb/>Avoiding any awkwardness, and when
<lb/>The water shall perfume the basin’s brim
<lb/>Forbear to pour.”
<lb/>The servitor took heed,
<lb/>And on the next occasion, when he brought
<lb/>The salver, poured the water as the sage
<lb/>Enjoined with neither tardiness nor haste.
<lb/>“O thou whose love increaseth!” said the Shah,
<lb/>“Who told thee this?”
<lb/>He answered: “Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>For he it was that taught to me the mode
<lb/>Marked by the Shah, the master of the world.”
<lb/>The Shah said: ‘‘Go and say thus to the sage:—
<lb/>‘With all that high estate of thine and lustre
<lb/>Why didst thou seek the worse and not the better
<lb/>Through thine ill nature and misgovernance?’”
<lb/>The attendant heard and coming quickly sought
<lb/>The palace eagerly with stricken soul,
<lb/>Gave Buzurjmihr the message of the Shah,
<lb/>And privily received this answer back:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1753"/>
<lb/>"My station both in public and in private
<lb/>Far bettereth the monarch of the world’s.”
</p><p>
<pb n="7"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>The servitor returned with this response,
<lb/>But counted as he went the grains of dust.
<lb/>The answer made the Shah exceeding wroth.
<lb/>He had the sage bound in a dismal dungeon,
<lb/>And asked the servitor the second time:—
<lb/>“How beareth that insensate one his lot?”
</p><p>
<lb/>The messenger came with a tearful face,
</p><p>
<lb/>And told the words to Buzurjmihr who thus
<lb/>Made answer to that faithful friend of his:—
<lb/>“My days are passed more lightly than the Shah’s.”
</p><p>
<lb/>The messenger turned back, came like the wind,
<lb/>And told the Shah that answer, which enraged him;
<lb/>He was as ’twere a pard and bade to make
<lb/>A narrow iron cage, then studded it
<lb/>With spikes and nails inside, and set thereon
<lb/>Withal an iron lid. Thus Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Could neither rest by day nor sleep by night.
<lb/>Thus for the fourth time to the servitor
<lb/>The Shah said: “Take this message and bring back
<lb/>His answer. Say to him: ‘How far’st thou now,
<lb/>Environed as thou art by piercing nails?’”
</p><p>
<lb/>The attendant came and gave the message sent
<lb/>By that imperious prince. Thus Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Made answer to the youth: ‘‘My days are better
<lb/>Than those of Nushirwan.”
</p><p>
<lb/>Now when the man
<lb/>Returned with this reply the Shah’s face grew
<lb/>All livid at the words. Out of the palace
<lb/>He chose a truthful man and capable
<lb/>Of comprehending what the sage should say,
<lb/>Dispatched too with the messenger a swordsman,
<lb/>Who acted as the executioner,
<lb/>And said: “Go to this bad, ill-fortuned man,
<lb/>And say: ‘If thy reply give pleasure, well;
<lb/>If not the deathsman with his trenchant sword
<lb/>Shall show thee Doomsday in that thou hast said
</p><p>
<pb n="8"/>
<lb/>That jail and nails and cage, and pit and bonds
<lb/>Are better than the throne of Nushirwan.’”
<lb/>The envoy came apace to him and told
<lb/>The words of Nushirwan. Said Buzurjmihr
<lb/>To that good envoy: “Fortune ne’er hath shown us
<lb/>Its face. None of us is exempt from change,
<lb/>And verily all good and ill will end.
<lb/>Enthroned and rich or grievously oppressed,
<lb/>We have no choice, we all must pack and part.
<lb/>To pass from durance is an easy thing;
<lb/>The quaking is for them that wear the crown.”
<lb/>That wise man and the executioner
<lb/>Returned and, coming to the exalted Shah,
<lb/>Narrated everything that they had heard.
<lb/>The fear of evil fortune came upon him.
<lb/>They bore that righteous guide from that strait cage
<lb/>Back to his palace with the Shah’s consent,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1754"/>
<lb/>And heaven turned awhile with matters thus,
<lb/>While wrinkles filled the face of Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>His heart grew more oppressed and worn, and both
<lb/>His eyes were darkened by anxiety,
<lb/>While since his travailing surpassed his gain
<lb/>He wasted with his care and pined with pain.</p>

</div>

<div><head>§ 2
How the Ambassador of Caesar came to Nushirwan with a locked Casket and how Buzurjmihr was set at large to declare its Contents</head>
<p>
<lb/><pb n="9"/>Now in those days it chanced that Caesar sent
<lb/>An envoy with a letter to the Shah,
<lb/>With gifts, with presents, and a padlocked casket,
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And said: “O king of warriors and chiefs!
<lb/>Thou hast no lack of holy archimages,
</p>
<p>
<lb/>So let them tell, not tampering with the lock,
<lb/>What is concealed therein. If they say right
<lb/>We will send tribute and our wonted gifts;
<lb/>But if thy clever archimages’ hearts

<lb/>Fail in this knowledge indispensable
<lb/>The Shah must not ask tribute at our hands,
<lb/>Nor send an army to invade our realm.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Such is the message that hath come from Caesar:
<lb/>Make answer as it seemeth good to thee.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The monarch of the world said to the envoy:—
<lb/>“This thing is not a mystery to God,

<lb/>And by His Grace divine I will achieve it,
<lb/>Convoking holy men to give me aid.
<lb/>Abide here for a se’nnight, cheered with wine,
<lb/>Make merry in thy heart and be at ease.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The matter proved perplexing to the Shah:
<lb/>He called to him the great men and the wise,
<lb/>Who all examined it in every way
<lb/>To find a means whereby to loose that coil,
<lb/>Examined, as did all the archimages,

<lb/>That casket and that lock whose key was lacking,
<lb/>But could not tell and owned their ignorance.
<lb/>Now when that concourse proved of no avail

<lb/>The heart of Nushirwan, the Shah, was grieved.
<lb/>He said: “The intellect of Buzurjmihr

<lb/>Will search this secret of the turning sky.”
</p><p>
<lb/>The king of kings, in sore embarrassment,
<lb/>Gave orders to his treasurer to provide
<lb/>A change of raiment from the treasury,

<lb/>And had a choice steed saddled royal wise.
</p><p>
<lb/>He sent them to the sage. “‘Thou must forget,”
<lb/>He said, “the hardships that thou hast endured
<lb/>Because high heaven above us so ordained

<lb/>That thou shouldst have affliction at our hands.
<lb/><pb n="10"/>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1755"/>
<lb/>Thy tongue excited my displeasure: thou
<lb/>Hast been the author of thine own oppression.
<lb/>I am confronted with a thankless task,
<lb/>The elders’ hearts have been perplexed thereby,
<lb/>For Caesar hath dispatched to us from Rum
<lb/>A famed priest of that land and therewithal
<lb/>A casket with a tightly fastened lid
<lb/>Padlocked and sealed with musk. The envoy saith:—
<lb/>‘Thus said my lord: “Reveal this hidden thing,
<lb/>And let the sages and the princes say
<lb/>What lieth in this casket.” So methought:—
<lb/>‘No one will see through this veiled mystery
<lb/>Unless it be the soul of Buzurjmihr.’”
<lb/>When Buzurjmihr had listened to those words
<lb/>His pain and former trouble were renewed;
<lb/>He left the prison, bathed his head and body,
<lb/>And first approached in prayer the Lord of all.
<lb/>Albeit innocent himself he feared
<lb/>The Shah, the wrathful world-lord’s, tyranny.
<lb/>He watched that day and night alike and pondered -
<lb/>According to the message of his master.
<lb/>What time the sun was brilliant in the heavens
<lb/>He mused upon the aspects of the stars,<note>Couplet omitted and reading with P.</note>
<lb/>He laved his heart’s eyes in the stream of wisdom,
<lb/>Chose out a trusty man among the sages,
<lb/>And said to him: “My market hath been spoiled,
<lb/>My vision ruined by my sufferings.
<lb/>Observe upon the road the passers by,
<lb/>Address them, have no fear, and ask their names.”
<lb/>Forth from his house went Bazurjmihr and met
<lb/>A woman hasting, beautiful of face.
<lb/>That wise man vigilant informed the sage
<lb/>Of all things that were hidden from his eyes,
<lb/>And he as feeling for his way rejoined:—
<pb n="11"/>
<lb/>“Ask if this Moon be wedded.”
<lb/>Said the lady:—
<lb/>“I have a spouse and child withal at home.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The sage on his white roadster, when he heard
<lb/>Her answer, started. Then another woman
<lb/>Appeared and, seeing her, his agent asked:—
</p><p>
<lb/>“O woman, hast thou got a child and spouse,
<lb/>Or, being single, only wind in hand?”
</p><p>
<lb/>“I have a husband if no child,” she said,
</p><p>
<lb/>“Thou hast mine answer, suffer me to pass.”
</p><p>
<lb/>Just then another woman came—the third.
</p><p>
<lb/>Her too the friend approached. “My Fair!” said he,
<lb/>“What mate hast thou who hast such goodly carriage
<lb/>And daintiness?”
<lb/>“I never had a husband,”
<lb/>She said, “I would not one should see my face.”
</p><p>
<lb/>Now mark the inference of Buzurjmihr
<lb/>On hearing these replies. He hurried on
<milestone unit="calced" n="1750"/>
<lb/>With anxious mien. They brought him to the Shah,
<lb/>Who ordered that he should approach the throne,
<lb/>But was exceeding troubled in his heart
<lb/>Because he missed the sage’s piercing glance,
</p><p>
<lb/>And heaved full many a deep and chilling sigh,
<lb/>Excused himself for having wronged the guiltless,
<lb/>Then talked of Caesar and of Rum, and spake
<lb/>Of casket and of padlock. Buzurjmihr
</p><p>
<lb/>Made answer to the monarch of the world:—
<lb/>“Be lustre thine so long as heaven shall turn.
<lb/>Now must we hold a session of the wise,
</p><p>
<lb/>Of Caesar’s envoy, and the archimages,
</p><p>
<lb/>And have the casket laid before the Shah,
<lb/>Before the Great, the seekers of the way;
<lb/>Then in God’s strength, who gave me intellect,
<lb/>And made the right the business of my soul,
</p><p>
<lb/>I will declare the casket’s whole contents,
<lb/><pb n="12"/>
<lb/>And lay no hand on it or on its lock.
</p><p>
<lb/>Although mine eyes be dim my heart is bright;
</p><p>
<lb/>The breastplate of my soul withal is knowledge.”
<lb/>The king joyed at the words. His heart grew fresh
<lb/>As roses in the Spring. Anxiety
</p><p>
<lb/>Bent him no longer, and he called for envoy
<lb/>And casket, summoned all the archimages
<lb/>And mighty men, and seated many a sage
<lb/>With Buzurjmihr, then told the ambassador:—
</p><p>
<lb/>“Repeat thy message and demand an answer.”
<lb/>The Ruman, hearing, loosed his tongue and thus
</p><p>
<lb/>Told Caesar’s words: “From the victorious world-lord
<lb/>We look for wisdom, knowledge, and renown,
<lb/>And thou, O master of the world! hast Grace,
<lb/>And stature, greatness, lore, and might of hand.
</p><p>
<lb/>The wise archimages—seekers of the way—
<lb/>The chiefs and heroes that attend upon thee,
<lb/>Are either all assembled at thy court,
<lb/>Or are thy lieges still where’er they be.
</p><p>
<lb/>If these shrewd-hearted sages shall behold
<lb/>This casket with its lock and seal and stamp,
<lb/>And state distinctly what is there concealed,
<lb/>So that their statement shall accord to wisdom,
<lb/>Then by this token I will send to thee
<lb/>The tribute that my realm can well afford;
<lb/>But if in any wise they fail herein
<lb/>Ask not for tribute from our land again.”
<lb/>Whenas the sage had heard the speaker’s words
</p><p>
<lb/>He loosed his tongue and offered praise and said:—
<lb/>“Oh! be the world’s Shah Shah for evermore,
<lb/>May he be eloquent and fare with fortune!
</p><p>
<lb/>Praise to the Master of the sun and moon,
<lb/>Who showeth to the soul the path to knowledge,
<lb/>And knoweth all things manifest and hidden;
<lb/><pb n="13"/>
<lb/>I covet knowledge, He is past all need.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1757"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>Within the casket are three lustrous pearls,
</p><p>
<lb/>And greater coverture than I have said.<note>Reading with P.</note>
</p><p>
<lb/>One pearl is pierced, the second is half pierced,
<lb/>The third hath had no intercourse with iron.”
<lb/>The Ruman sage, on hearing, brought the key
</p><p>
<lb/>To Nushirwan who looked. Concealed within
<lb/>There was a pyx, and in the pyx a veil
<lb/>Of painted silk, and in the silk three jewels,
<lb/>Just as the wise man of Iran had said,
</p><p>
<lb/>Because of those three gems the first was pierced,
<lb/>The second half pierced and the third intact.
<lb/>Then all the archimages praised the sage
<lb/>And showered gems on him. The king of kings
<lb/>Became of joyful countenance and filled
</p><p>
<lb/>The mouth of Buzurjmihr with lustrous pearls.
<lb/>His conduct in the past oppressed his heart,
<lb/>He writhed, his face grew furrowed: why had he
<lb/>Dealt so oppressively with Buzurjmihr
<lb/>From whom he had experienced love and faith?
</p><p>
<lb/>The sage, when he beheld the Shah’s shrunk face,
<lb/>And grief-pierced soul, revealed what had been hidden,
<lb/>Declared all that had passed to Nushirwan,
<lb/>Told of the armlet, of the sable bird,
<lb/>The liege’s care, the slumber of the Shah,
<lb/>And added: “This was doomed to come to pass,
<lb/>And sorrow and remorse will profit not.
<lb/>When heaven is intending good or ill
<lb/>What are Shah, archimage, or Buzurjmihr?
<lb/>God hath implanted in the stars the seed,
<lb/>And we must write the sentence on our heads;
<lb/>So let the heart of Nushirwan, the Shah,
<lb/>Rejoice exempt from pain and grief for ever.
<lb/>Exalted though the Shah be yet his state
<lb/><pb n="14"/>
<lb/>Is made more gracious by his minister.
<lb/>The chase, war, pleasure, largess, justice, feast,
<lb/>These are the business of the king of kings.
<lb/>He knoweth what Shahs did in days of yore,
<lb/>So by that token let him do the same.
<lb/>To gather treasure, to provide the host,
<lb/>To chide, speak, hear the suppliant, and take thought
<lb/>For rule and treasure, these things are a care,
<lb/>That, heart and soul, the minister must bear.”</p>

<div><head>§ 3
Discourse on the Responses of Nushirwan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thus was it at the time of Nushirwan:
</p><p>
<lb/>He was at once the Shah and paladin,

<lb/>At once a warrior and archimage,

<lb/>The Fire-priest and the captain of the host.
</p><p>
<lb/>He had his emissaries everywhere,

<lb/>And trusted not the world to ministers.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1758"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>None could conceal from him in great or small

<lb/>The good and evil of the world’s estate.
<lb/>One day a loyal archmage of his agents

<lb/>Took on himself to put this to the Shah:—
</p><p>
<lb/>“One time without reproof thou passest by

<lb/>A fault. Another time the same offender

<lb/>Is hung howe’er much he excuse himself!”
<lb/>The Shah replied: ‘‘When one doth own his fault

<lb/>I am as leech, he is as wretched patient

<lb/>That would avoid the dose and sheddeth tears;
</p><p>
<lb/>If that dose fail I leech his soul no more.”
<lb/>Another archmage said to him: “Be blest,

<lb/>And sheltered from all ill on every side!
<lb/><pb n="15"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>The captain of the host went from Gurgan

<lb/>With privacy, and entering a wood.
<lb/>There for a while he slumbered. The Gurkils

<lb/>Bore off his baggage! He was left unfurnished,

<lb/>And, further, turneth back on that account!”
<lb/>The Shah made answer thus: “We do not need

<lb/>That militarist. How can he guard troops

<lb/>Who cannot guard himself?”<note>Mohl translates: <quote xml:lang="fra">Le Sipehbed est sorti un jour de Gourgan en secret, est entré dans un bois et y a dormi pendant quelque temps ; ses bagages étaient sur un autre steppe, il n’avait rien avec lui et fut obligé de s’en revenir pour rejoindre ses bagages.” Nouschirwan répondit par cette sentence: ‘Je n’avais pas besoin d’une escorte ; celui qui veille sur l’armée ne s’inquiète pas pour lui-même.</quote></note>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/>“Live happy evermore with archimages

<lb/>To sit, to banquet, and repose with thee!
<lb/>There is a famous chieftain present here,

<lb/>Whose treasure passeth thine!”
<lb/>The Shah replied:—
<lb/>‘Yea, rightly, for he is our empire’s crown.
<lb/>I tender both his treasures and his life,

<lb/>And toil to magnify him.”
<lb/>Said another:—
<lb/>“Great king! live ever and unscathed by ill!
</p><p>
<lb/>Among the captives carried off from Rum
<lb/>Are many babes unweaned.”
<lb/>He gave this sentence:—
<lb/>“The little ones must not be reckoned captives.
<lb/>We will dispatch them glad and in good case
<lb/>To their own mothers.”
<lb/>People wrote to him:—
<lb/>“A hundred wealthy Rumans offer ransom.”
<lb/>“If they are doing it through fear,” he said,
<lb/>“‘Sell each chief for a cup of wine and ask
<lb/>No more because we do not lack their goods.
<lb/>I will require their jewels, purses, slaves,
<lb/><pb n="16"/>
<lb/>And gold and silver with the scimitar.”
</p><p>
<lb/>They told him: “Of the rich men of the city
<lb/>There are two merchants and they keep folk waking
<lb/>The best part of the night with shouts of revel,
<lb/>And twanging of the rebeck and the harp.”
</p><p>
<lb/>He made them this reply: “No hardship this,
<lb/>And do ye others that are wealthy too
<lb/>Live like these twain in mirth and jollity;
<lb/>Be inoffensive and live unaggrieved.”
<milestone unit="calced" n="1759"/>
<lb/>One day they wrote to him: “Mayst thou be happy!
</p><p>
<lb/>Far from thee ever be the evil eye!
<lb/>The monarch of Yaman observed at court:—
<lb/>‘When Nushirwan doth ope his mouth to speak
<lb/>He talketh so much of the dead that those
<lb/>Alive have their glad lives made sad thereby’
</p><p>
<lb/>He answered thus: “All wise and high-born men
<lb/>Speak of the dead: the friendship is not sound
<lb/>Of any that would purge the heart of them.”
<lb/>Another said: “O Shah! thy youngest son
<lb/>Doth act not with the justice of his sire.
</p><p>
<lb/>He buyeth an estate at such a rate
<lb/>As to aggrieve the seller!”
<lb/>Said the Shah:—
<lb/>“This is not well, so let the seller keep
<lb/>Both price and land.”
<lb/>‘O Shah,” another said,
<lb/>“Imperious, far from blame and from reproach!
<lb/>Thy heart was gentle once: why hath it grown
<lb/>So overbearing and so choleric?”
</p><p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: ‘I had no teeth then,
<lb/>And fed on milk because I could no other,

<lb/>But since my teeth came, and my back grew straight,
<lb/>My quest is flesh because I have grown strong.”
<lb/>Another said: ‘‘I own that thou art mighty,
<lb/><pb n="17"/>
<lb/>Our better both in counsel and in knowledge,
<lb/>But how hast thou surpassed the kings of kings,
<lb/>And made the whole world watch thy policy?”
<lb/>“My wisdom is a thing,” he thus replied,
<lb/>“That is beyond their ken. Sense, knowledge, counsel—
<lb/>These are my ministers, my treasury
<lb/>Is earth, my treasurer thought.”
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/>“O king! thy hawk in chase hath bound an eagle!”
<lb/>Thus said he: “Beat its back; why should it fall
<lb/>Upon its better? Gibbet it on high
<lb/>To suffer in its turn, for e’en in fight
<lb/>The subject may not seek to conquer kings.”
<lb/>Another chief—one of the emissaries—
<lb/>Said thus: ‘O monarch of the world! Barzin
<lb/>At morn departed with the host and met
<lb/>A reader of the stars who prophesied:—
<lb/>‘None will behold again this haughty chief,
<lb/>This mighty army, and its equipage,
<lb/>When once their backs are turned upon the king!’”
<lb/>The Shah replied: ‘Revolving heaven hath shown
<lb/>Barzin’s designs a loving countenance,
<lb/>And stars and sun and moon will not destroy
<lb/>That chieftain with his treasure and his host.”
<lb/>Another archmage said: “The king, one day,
<lb/>Bade choose a man, illustrious by birth,
<lb/>To make the circuit of the sovereignty
<lb/>Both for the sake of justice and to send
<milestone unit="calced" n="1760"/>
<lb/>Reports concerning matters great and small,
<lb/>And good or evil, to the court. Gashasp
<lb/>Is both illustrious and old: ’twere well
<lb/>That justice be administered by him.”
<lb/><pb n="18"/>
<lb/>The Shah replied: “Gashasp, though far from want,
<lb/>Is still possessed by greed. Choose some one else,
<lb/>Who toileth not upon his own behalf,
<lb/>And is possessed of treasures of his own,
<lb/>One of experience, upright and austere,
<lb/>Whose first concern is for the poor.”
<lb/>One said:—
<lb/>“The chief cook hath a grievance ’gainst the Shah
<lb/>And chiefs, and saith: ‘I dress his favourite meats,
<lb/>And serve them at cross roads. He savoureth not,
<lb/>Nor toucheth, them!’ That loyal—servant quaketh.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“Too much food may disgust,” the Shah replied.
<lb/>Another said: “All thoughtful people blame
<lb/>The king of kings because he goeth forth
<lb/>Without an ample escort, and the hearts
<lb/>Of all his friends are full on that account
<lb/>For fear some enemy with ill designs
<lb/>May suppliant-wise contrive to get at him.”
</p>
<p><lb/>He made this answer: “Equity and wisdom
<lb/>Protect the great king’s person. Right sufficeth
<lb/>To guard the just Judge though he be alone.”
</p>
<p><lb/>Another said: ‘O wisdom’s mate! the prince
<lb/>Of Khurasan said on the riding-ground:—
</p><p>
<lb/>‘I know not why the king recalled Garshasp.’”
</p>
<p><lb/>The Shah made answer: ‘He hath left undone
<lb/>My bidding and ignored my purposes:

<lb/>I ordered him to ope for good or ill
<lb/>My treasury’s portal to deserving folk.

<lb/>The man that is a niggard in his gifts
<lb/>Concealeth all the monarch’s Grace divine.”

<lb/>Another said: “The great king is a magnate
<lb/>With all men, and munificent and holy.

<lb/>What hath Mihrak, that ancient servant, done
<lb/>To have his pay reduced, his visage wan?<pb n="19"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah replied: “Mihrak hath grown too bold,
<lb/>Relying on his former services.
<lb/>He came to court and took his seat bemused,
<lb/>And he was never save with wine in hand.”
</p>
<p><lb/>An archmage of the intelligencers said:—
<lb/>“The Shah, when marching to encounter Caesar,
<lb/>Called only the Iranians to the war,
<lb/>And so Iran became hard pressed by Rum.”
</p>
<p><lb/>He answered: “This hostility is innate,
<lb/>'Tis war with Ahriman.”
<lb/>Another time
<lb/>One ventured to observe: “The Shah selecteth
<lb/>Troops differing from those of former Shahs.
<lb/>What look’st thou for in charger-riding Lions,
<lb/>Expert of hand, upon the day of battle?<milestone unit="calced" n="1761"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus replied: “The cavalier of war
<lb/>Ne’er must be satiate of combating.
<lb/>Feast and the field of battle must be one
<lb/>To him both by bright day and darksome night.
<lb/>He never faileth in the hour of need,
<lb/>And few or many make no odds to him.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: ‘O Nushirwan, the Shah!
<lb/>Live ever joyful and with youthful fortune.
<lb/>A man was at the gateway from Nisa—
<lb/>A servant and a trusty officer—
<lb/>Who at the reckoning at the taxing-office
<lb/>Was found short by three hundred thousand drachms.
<lb/>He pleaded: ‘All are spent.’ Chiefs, archimages,
<lb/>And tax-collectors are concerned.”
<lb/>The king,
<lb/>On hearing how the archimages claimed
<lb/>The money from the officer, commanded:—
<lb/>“Press not for what is spent: give him too something
<lb/>Out of the treasury.<pb n="20"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/>“A gallant cavalier was hurt and long
<lb/>Disabled. Cured he charged the ranks of Rum,
<lb/>Fell, and hath left behind him little ones.”
<lb/>The Shah commanded: “Be four thousand drachms
<lb/>Assigned to them out of the treasury,
<lb/>Because when any one is slain in war,
<lb/>And leaveth babes as his memorial,
<lb/>Whene’er the scribe shall read out from the roll
<lb/>His name, his children must have drachms, so pay
<lb/>A thousand thus to them four times a year.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: “Be happy all thy days.
<lb/>At Marv the captain of the host hath gathered
<lb/>Much wealth in money but he spendeth not,
<lb/>And people are abandoning the march.”
<lb/>He thus made answer: “Give that wealth—the cause
<lb/>Whereby the land is made depopulate—
<lb/>Back to the folk from whom it hath been taken.
<lb/>Make proclamation of the fact in Marv,
<lb/>And bid erect a gibbet at his door,
<lb/>In sight of all his province and his troops,
<lb/>And hang alive the tyrant on the gallows,
<lb/>Head-downward, that hereafter nobody
<lb/>Among our paladins may turn aside
<lb/>In heart and spirit from our ordinance.
<lb/>Why must he bleed the poor to get him wealth,
<lb/>And joy his body to his soul’s destruction?”
<lb/>Another said: *God-fearing Shah! thy subjects
<lb/>Throng in thy court, extol thine equity,
<lb/>And praise the Maker for thee.”
<lb/>He replied:—
<lb/>“Thank God that we inspire alarm in none.
<lb/>Be it ours to tender yet more carefully
<lb/>Both innocent and guilty.<pb n="21"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said another:—
<lb/>“O Shah endowed with Grace and understanding!
<lb/>The world is full of joy, delight, and sweets,<milestone unit="calced" n="1762"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And lord and liege are dizzied in their heads
<lb/>At night-fall with the din.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“In us,” he answered,
<lb/>“May small and great rejoice throughout the world.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: “O Shah of power supreme!
<lb/>Detractors speak with blame of thee and say:—
<lb/>‘He squandereth vast treasures but he never
<lb/>Hath felt the labour of amassing them.’”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus returned reply: “If I withhold
<lb/>The wealth laid up within my treasury
<lb/>From those deserving of it all my gain
<lb/>Will turn to loss at last.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/>“O thou exalted king! God grant that scath
<lb/>May never come upon that soul of thine!
<lb/>The Jews and Christians are thine enemies,
<lb/>Are double-faced, and worship Ahriman.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>A brave Shah is not great
<lb/>Save he be tolerant.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><note n="1">Reading with P.</note>Mardwi hath spent,

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah that toilest not !

<lb/><q>We,</q> he made reply,

<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>He turneth him from wisdom,

</p>
<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O Shah that tendereth thy subjects ?
<lb/>Why hast thou recently become remiss ?</q>

<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>I associate

</p>
<p>
<lb/>An archmage asked the monarch of the earth

<p>
<lb/>And said: <q>A man of wisdom will allow
<lb/>A faithless better than a kingless world.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>I have said the same,
<lb/>And holy men have heard my words. The world-lord
<lb/>Ne’er saw a faithless world though every one
<lb/>Hath his own Faith. One man adoreth idols,
<lb/>Another’s Faith is pure. One said: <q>A curse
<lb/>Is better than a blessing,</q> but mere words
<lb/>Will never wreck the world, so speak thy mind.
<lb/>But when the great king too is void of Faith
<lb/>No one will bring down blessings on the world.
<lb/>Faith and the sovereignty are like the body
<lb/>And soul; the twain support the world.</q><note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>QO Shah

<lb/>One said, <q>before the chiefs : <q>What time the throne
<lb/>Is destitute of king then Faith and wisdom
<lb/>Are worthless.</q> Once thou saidest: <q>I am fortune,
<lb/>And fortune’s pretext both for good and ill,
<lb/>And when one uttereth praises in the world
<lb/>The crop in secret cometh back to me.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Yea, ’tis well. The great king’s head
<lb/>Is fortune’s crown. The world is as the body ;
<lb/>Kings are its head and crowned accordingly.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah, the people’s friend !
<lb/>Be thine the sovereignty and length of days!
<lb/>Five days have passed, O lustre of the soul !
<lb/>Since last the high priest came before thy presence.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>I am not concerned thereat,

</p>
<p>

<p>
<lb/>The sentences of Nushirwan are past,
<lb/>The world is old but ever young my care ;

<head>§ 4
Nushirwan’s Letter of Counsel to his Son Hurmuz</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now read the letter of Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And muse upon it in thine ardent soul.
<lb/>He said: <q>This letter grateful to the heart,
<lb/>Instructed, learned, well counselled, and abstruse,
<lb/>Is from the Shah exalted and sun-faced.
<lb/>Great is he, heaven inclineth to his wish,
<lb/>The world-lord he, just and beneficent,
<lb/>Without reproach, the lavisher of treasure,
<lb/>Increaser of Kubad’s renown and throne,
<lb/>Transmitter of the crown of state and justice,
<lb/>Possessed of Grace and stature, fame and conduct,
<lb/>And all that he could wish for from the crown
<lb/>Of greatness, to Hurmuz, our own pure son,
<lb/>Who heartily accepteth all our counsels,
<lb/>And is through God glad and victorious,
<lb/>For evermore a world-lord crowned and throned.
<lb/>This lucky month upon the day Khurdad,
<lb/>With fair stars and world-brightening presages,
<lb/>We set upon thy head the crown of gold,
<lb/>As we ourselves received it from our sire,
<lb/>And give thee too the blessings which Kubad,
<lb/>The glorious, bestowed upon our crown.
<lb/>Be vigilant and master of the world,
<lb/>Be wise and noble and without offence,
<lb/>Increase in knowledge and incline to God,
<lb/>Because He is the Guider of thy soul.
<lb/>We have inquired of one of good discourse,
<lb/>One ancient both in wisdom and in years:—
<lb/><q>What man of us approacheth nearest God?
<lb/>Who goeth by the straitest path to Him?</q>
<lb/>He gave reply: <q>Choose knowledge as thou wouldst
<lb/>That people should bless thee because the sage


<pb n="26"/>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1765"/>

<lb/>Deriveth not addition from the dust:
<lb/>Make thy pure spirit then approved by knowledge.</q>
<lb/>Through knowledge doth the Shah adorn the throne:
<lb/>Mayst thou be sage and of victorious fortune.
<lb/>God grant thou never be a promise-breaker,
<lb/>For promise-breakers have the dust for shroud.
<lb/>See that thou punish not the innocent,
<lb/>Or listen to the words of slanderers.
<lb/>Let every ordinance of thine be just,
<lb/>For justice will delight thy spirit. Seek not,
<lb/>As thou wouldst be the lustre of thy throne,
<lb/>To compass falsehood with thy tongue. Secure
<lb/>A subject in the enjoyment of his wealth,
<lb/>For others’ havings are no friends of thine:
<lb/>Joy in the wealth that thou hast earned thyself.
<lb/>‘Tis thine to be the asylum for all folk,
<lb/>For overlord and underling alike.
<lb/>Reward the man that acteth uprightly;
<lb/>Oppose withal the evil-doer. Although
<lb/>Thou mayst be held in honour in the world,
<lb/>Forget not travail, misery, and loss;
<lb/>Be what one may this is a Wayside Inn
<lb/>Wherein it booteth not to feel at home.
<lb/>Seek worth and be associate with the wise
<lb/>If dost wish that fortune shall commend thee.
<lb/>By knowledge bind the hands of tyranny,
<lb/>As thou wouldst scape the evil of mishap,
<lb/>And dearly tender him who in thy presence
<lb/>Hath trodden under foot thy foeman’s life.
<lb/>The great men and the merchants of the city
<lb/>Must have their share of justice. When thou settest
<lb/>The crown of king of kings upon thy head
<lb/>Discern the worse way from the truly great.
<lb/>Keep ever in thy presence some wise man,
<lb/>And hold him as thy body and thy soul.


<pb n="27"/>


<lb/>In matters great and small pay no regard
<lb/>To any save the accomplished and well born.
<lb/>Give not the worthless battle-gear for when
<lb/>Thou seekest it ’tis not to hand. Thy friend
<lb/>Will yield thee to the foe; a double task
<lb/>Both difficult and wretched will be thine:
<lb/>He will bring down thy weapons to the field,
<lb/>And one day will employ them on thyself.
<lb/>Be generous to persons in distress,
<lb/>Avoid ill-doing, fear calamity,
<lb/>Discern the hidden motives of thy heart,
<lb/>Make no mere outward show of good and right,
<lb/>Be not unmeasured in beneficence,
<lb/>And hear the counsels of the experienced.
<lb/>Lean toward religious men but watch religion,
<lb/>Because it causeth bitterness and wrath.
<lb/>Proportion thine expenses to thy means,
<lb/>And be not careful to augment thy store.
<lb/>Observe the precedents of former Shahs,
<lb/>And be a righteous judge in everything;


<milestone unit="calced" n="1766"/>


<lb/>The Shah that doth unjustly is accursed;
<lb/>Approve but justice then and court not curses.
<lb/>Where are the crowned heads of the kings of kings?
<lb/>Where are the great men and the ministers?
<lb/>Their fame is now their sole memorial;
<lb/>This Wayside Inn abideth not with any.
<lb/>Command not to shed blood, or urge the host
<lb/>To battle, lightly. Heed this weighty letter.
<lb/>Set not thy heart upon this Hostelry.
<lb/>Herein have I but sought thy good and decked
<lb/>Thy heart with knowledge by the rede of Him
<lb/>Who ruleth sun and moon; by Him keep off
<lb/>The influence of the Div. Have thou before thee
<lb/>This letter, day and night. Let wisdom rule
<lb/>Thy heart. If thou dost make a memory here
<lb/>Thy name will never want for majesty.


<pb n="28"/>


<lb/>Now be the Maker of the world thy refuge,
<lb/>May time and earth affect thee. May high heaven
<lb/>Turn but at thy desire and in the world
<lb/>Be none aggrieved by thee.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He placed the letter,
<lb/>When written, in the treasury and abode
<lb/>With fear and trembling in this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>A king of kings well counselled, wise, and just,
<lb/>Will strive to make his modesty unite
<lb/>With strength of hand and gallantry in fight,
<lb/>Be of pure Faith and put in God his trust.
<lb/>See what man of these virtues is possest
<lb/>And, seeing, him his meed of praise prefer,
<lb/>Seek one that is as bright as Jupiter,
<lb/>Aspiring, armed with sword, with mail on breast;
<lb/>Who taketh from idolaters the sway,
<lb/>Who with brocade of Faith his heart hath bound.
<lb/>Yea verily the man himself is found:
<lb/>Mahmud is monarch of the world to-day.
<lb/>The quest of battle and of banqueting
<lb/>Are one to this world’s lord. Abwt’l Kasim!
<lb/>God grant the age joy in the sight of him,
<lb/>That open-handed and victorious king.

<div><head>§5 How an Archmage questioned Nushirwan and how he made Answer</head>
<p>
<lb/>There was an elder versed in our old speech,
<lb/>And antiquate with action and discourse,
<lb/>Who from a volume in the ancient tongue
</p>

<pb n="29"/>

<p>
<lb/>Saith that an archmage asked of Nushirwan:—
<lb/><q>In what way should the worshipper invoke
<lb/>In secret prayer the Master of the world
<lb/>That He may give an answer and bestow
<lb/>Withal fair fortune on his suppliant?
<lb/>A man, with arms outstretched toward the sky,
<lb/>May make request before the Lord of time,</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1767"/>

<p>
<lb/>Yet gain not his desire for all his prayers,
<lb/>And hath but tearful eyes and furrowed face.
<lb/>The conquering Shah replied: <q>Be moderate
<lb/>In thy requests to God; when they pass bounds
<lb/>A heart o’ercharged will come of that desire.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>What man deserveth good,
<lb/>And who is worthiest of the name of ‘Great?’</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>He that amasseth treasure
<lb/>Without exertion, and bestoweth not,
<lb/>Is unfit for the throne; from time to time
<lb/>His fortune will grow dark, but well is he
<lb/>That giveth. Give, if wealth be thine, and hoard not.</q>
<lb/>“What is the base of wisdom?” asked the archmage,
<lb/><q>And who rejoiceth in its boughs and leaves?</q>
<lb/>“The sage rejoiceth,” Nushirwan replied;
<lb/><q>So doth the modest man of noble birth.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Who profiteth by knowledge,
<lb/>And who is witless and calamitous?</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>The cherisher of wisdom
<lb/>Will cherish life which profiteth thereby
<lb/>When it aboundeth, but its lack entaileth
<lb/>Grief, care, and loss.</q>
<lb/>The archmage inquired:—
<lb/><q>Is knowledge better than the Grace of kings,
<lb/>For Grace and majesty adorn the throne?</q>
<lb/>“A sage possessed of Grace,” replied the Shah,
</p>

<pb n="30"/>

<p>
<lb/>Will take the whole world underneath his wing.
<lb/>Thou needest wisdom, Grace, renown, and birth;
<lb/>With these four heaven will keep thee still in mind.
<lb/>“In kingship who illustrateth the throne?”
<lb/>The archmage said. “Who is unfortunate?”
<lb/>And Nushirwan made answer: <q>One that seeketh
<lb/>First for the aidance of the King, the World-lord,</q><note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/><q>For bounty, knowledge, and right usages
<lb/>Will make him tender toward the suppliant.
<lb/>Next let him give authority to those,
<lb/>Who merit such distinction by their worth.
<lb/>Then let him see that nothing in the world
<lb/>For good or evil is concealed from him.
<lb/>He should distinguish, fourthly, foe from friend:
<lb/>Tis well that kings should be without offence.
<lb/>When he hath Grace and wisdom, Faith and fortune,
<lb/>Then he is worthy of the crown and graceth
<lb/>The throne, while if thou findest such things lacking
<lb/>Good sooth! thou wilt behold him lustreless;
<lb/>He after death will leave an evil name,
<lb/>And win not jocund Paradise at last.</q><note>Five couplets omitted.</note>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1768"/>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>How many modes of speech
<lb/>Are there and what are they, because o’er some
<lb/>One needs must weep while others are crown, treasure,
<lb/>And reputation, those grief, these content?</q>
<lb/>Said Nushirwan: <q>The sage hath classified
<lb/>The modes of speech and thought the matter out.
<lb/>First, profitable speech; the sweet-voiced sage
<lb/>Saith that it is the harmless. Secondly,
<lb/>That which thou callest the deliberate
<lb/>Know to be that of shrewd and fluent men,
<lb/>For they speak</q><note>Reading with P.</note><q>largely to the point and leave


<pb n="31"/>


<lb/>Their memory in the world. Next is the speech
<lb/>Of one ambitioning the word in season;
<lb/>He will abide in honour all his years;
<lb/>And, fourthly, that of one called by the sage
<lb/>Delectable—the competent reciter,
<lb/>Who uttereth all, both new and old, in verse;
<lb/>While, fifthly, is the warm deliverance
<lb/>Of one of sweet tongue and harmonious voice,
<lb/>Who when he hath impleached his web of words
<lb/>Attaineth verily his heart’s desire.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>In spite of all thy lore,
<lb/>And thou hast kindled all thy soul with knowledge,
<lb/>Yet thou still questionest the little worth!
<lb/>Dost say then: ‘How shall knowledge have an end?’</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>From all that I have learned
<lb/>I have attained my soul’s desire and wisdom.
<lb/>Avoid wrong-doing then and look to knowledge—
<lb/>A thing more precious than the crown and throne.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>I have seen none so praised
<lb/>And eminent for lore that one could say:—
<lb/>‘Such is his eminence that no wise man
<lb/>Can teach him any further.’</q>
<lb/>Thus the Shah
<lb/>Replied: <q>Can treasure satiate a man
<lb/>Until he lieth underneath the dust?
<lb/>The way of knowledge is more glorious
<lb/>Than wealth, more precious in the sage’s eyes.
<lb/>Our words remain as our memorial:
<lb/>Compare not wealth with knowledge.</q>
</p>

<pb n="32"/>

<p>
<lb/>Said the archmage:—
<lb/><q>What with their learning and remembering
<lb/>The sages cannot be but ancient men.</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Although the man be old
<lb/>His knowledge faileth not to keep him young.
<lb/>Thou wilt prefer him to the foolish youth,
<lb/>Whose dust is only valued for its tomb.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>It was thy wont to speak
<lb/>About the fortune of the kings of kings
<lb/>Before the Great,</q><note>Reading with P and T.</note><q>and more than ever now
<lb/>Thou namest them but with a deep cold sigh?</q>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>It was never in my heart
<lb/>That I should praise a process such as this—
<lb/>To govern this world with the scimitar
<lb/>Of justice, then pass on and vilely die.</q>

<lb/>“Thy usage,” said the archmage, “in the past
<lb/>Was this—to speak to all in nobler words.
<lb/>Now, thou despisest them and sayest naught
<lb/>About the past or present.”
<lb/>Nushirwan
<lb/>Made answer saying: <q>I have talked enough,
<lb/>And now I purpose to depend on deeds.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Thy prayers in former times
<lb/>Before the Fire were not so long as now.
<lb/>Thy praises too are longer than they were,
<lb/>Thy plaints and supplications more profuse.</q>
<lb/>He gave this answer saying: <q>Holy God
<lb/>Exalteth from the dust His worshipper,
<lb/>Doth favourably dispose the sky toward him,
<lb/>And maketh all the world to be his slave.
<lb/>If this slave faileth to appreciate,
<lb/>Let him not scape from hardship and distress.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Since thou becamest king
<lb/>What greater cause for thankfulness hast thou
<lb/>Toward thy Maker? Hath that eminence
<lb/>Increased thy joy and filled thy foemen’s hearts
<lb/>With blood?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>Thanks be to God,
<lb/>Our fortune hath been good. None in my presence
<lb/>Hath ever sought for the supremacy,


<pb n="33"/>


<lb/>But at my chastening washed his hands of ill.
<lb/>My foemen have grown feeble in the fight
<lb/>When they beheld mine onset and my mace.</q>
<lb/>The priest went on: <q>When warring in the West
<lb/>Thou wast both quick of clutch and valorous,
<lb/>But when thou wast campaigning in the East
<lb/>Thou wast long-suffering and deliberate.</q>
<lb/>And Nushirwan made answer thus: <q>The youth
<lb/>Accounteth not of pain and toil of mind,
<lb/>But when a man hath come to sixty years
<lb/>He must assume a gentler attitude.
<lb/>Thanks to the World-lord who is all-providing,
<lb/>The Author of the good and ill of fortune,
<lb/>That I had prowess in my youthful days,
<lb/>And recked not if my luck were good or bad.
<lb/>Now knowledge, treasure, generosity,
<lb/>And rede, accompany my days of age,
<lb/>The world is ’neath my rule and usages,
<lb/>And circling heaven my breastplate in the fight.</q>
<lb/>Said the archmage: <q>The Shahs of long ago
<lb/>Desired to hold discourse on all affairs;
<lb/>Thy words are briefer and thy secrets more,
<lb/>Yet thou surpassest those famed men of old.</q>
<lb/>He made this answer, saying: <q>Every king,
<lb/>That doth believe in Him who giveth all,
<lb/>Is not concerned about himself for He,
<lb/>Who made the world, still watcheth over it.</q>
</p>

<pb n="34"/>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Shahs used to tend themselves,
<lb/>Employing drug and leech and remedy,
<lb/>Lest they should have to soil themselves with tears.</q>
<lb/>“A man, whose time is not yet come,” he said,
<lb/><q>Not yet o’ertaken by the turning sky,
<lb/>Will stand secure, and drugs will profit naught,
<lb/>Because the chance of time protecteth him,
<lb/>But when the hour for passing is at hand
<lb/>Then no precaution will avert his fate.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Thou praisest much and prayest
<lb/>The Maker, yet at heart thou art not glad
<lb/>The while, but ever hast a soul all care.</q>
<lb/>“There is no care at all,” said Nushirwan,
<lb/><q>The Shah’s heart is at one with turning heaven;
<lb/>I fear that those who offer praise to me,
<lb/>And shower benedictions on my Faith,
<lb/>Affect a greater fervour than they feel:
<lb/>Mine object is to read my subjects’ hearts.</q>
</p>

<pb n="35"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Why joy we in our children,</q> asked the archmage,
<lb/><q>And why do we desire a family?</q>
<lb/><q>The man that leaveth children in the world
<lb/>Will not become forgotten,” he replied.
<lb/>“If he have children he will relish life,
<lb/>And for that reason will abstain from vice,
<lb/>While if he pass away the pang is slight,
<lb/>Because a child’s eyes watch his paling face.</q>
<lb/>“Who liveth at his ease,” the archmage asked,
<lb/><q>And who repenteth of his own good deeds?</q>
<lb/>He thus replied: <q>The worshipper of God
<lb/>Will take the reins of fortune in his hands
<lb/>And, seeking no addition, is at ease,
<lb/>Who if he sought it would be full of fear.


<pb n="36"/>


<lb/>Then as for what thou said’st about good deeds,
<lb/>And secret inclinations to do good,
<lb/>Know, no one is more mortified than he
<lb/>That meditateth good for thankless folk.</q>
<lb/>“The evil-doer dieth,” said the archmage,
<lb/><q>The world removeth from the roll his name.
<lb/>The righteous man will likewise pass away,
<lb/>And destiny account his every breath.
<lb/>What need is there for praising excellence
<lb/>Since death is here to reap both good and bad?</q>
<lb/>And Nushirwan made answer thus: <q>Good deeds
<lb/>Will find a ready market everywhere.
<lb/>He that doth good deeds dieth not though dead,
<lb/>But resteth, giving up his soul to God;</q><note>Couplet omitted.</note>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage further said: <q>No ill is worse
<lb/>Than death. If so, then what is our resource?</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>On leaving this dark earth,
<lb/>The life which then thou wilt have gained is pure.
<lb/>Whoe’er lived here in fear and care must needs
<lb/>Bewail that life but, whether Shah or subject,
<lb/>Thou wilt be quit of this world’s fear and pain.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked him: <q>Which is worst of these
<lb/>In filling us with anguish and chagrin?</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>Reckon mountain-heavy
<lb/>The troubles that descend on us in troops,
<lb/>And what is fear except the fear of troubles,
<lb/>Than which there is naught stronger in the world?</q>
<lb/>“How can we ’scape from these?” the archmage asked,
<lb/><q>For this world’s doings give us cause to weep?</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>Knowledge is the way:
<lb/>The sage is ever cheerful.</q>
</p>

<pb n="37"/>

<p>
<lb/>“Which of us,”
<lb/>Inquired the archmage, <q>hath most store of treasure?</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>He that hath least toil.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Which is the foulest fault,
<lb/>One alien most from worth and Paradise?</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>In the case of women
<lb/>A strident voice and lack of modesty;
<lb/>But, in the case of men, to be a fool,
<lb/>And thus to spend a lifetime as in prison.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Who hath most confidence?</q>
<lb/>“He that hath least remorse,” replied the Shah,
<lb/><q>And goeth soiled in body, and with heart
<lb/>Black with iniquity, before his God.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Who is the upright man,
<lb/>Whose heart is proven by his soul and wisdom?</q>
<lb/>The Shah thus answered: <q>He that toileth on
<lb/>Through gain and loss and compasseth no ill.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Who is the best of men,
<lb/>The crown upon the head of all mankind?</q>
<lb/>“The meek to whom a crown availeth naught,”
<lb/>The Shah replied; <q>not one intent on profit,
<lb/>Not even though he be of lofty aims;
<lb/>Next, he whose greatness is its own reward—
<lb/>The generous man whose heart is purged from darkness—
<lb/>And, thirdly, he that hath a zeal divine,
<lb/>Proceeding from integrity and wisdom.</q>
<lb/>“What,” said the archmage, <q>is the heart’s chief dread?</q>
<lb/>“The troubles that we bring upon ourselves,”
<lb/>The Shah replied.
<lb/>“What giving is the best,”
<lb/>The archmage said, <q>so that the man who giveth


<pb n="38"/>


<lb/>May be exalted and great?</q>
<lb/>“In gain and loss,”
<lb/>The Shah rejoined, <q>keep naught from the deserving.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked concerning this world’s doings:—
<lb/><q>Declare its process open and concealed.
<lb/>Whate’er the manner of that action be,
<lb/>For loss or profit, shall we acquiesce?</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1772"/>

<p>
<lb/>“The All-knowing,” thus the Shah replied, <q>is greater
<lb/>And higher than this ancient sky although
<lb/>It knowing be and mindful; He is Lord
<lb/>Of this world’s lords. Become not then perverse,
<lb/>Avoid disaster, and attribute not
<lb/>Good fortune and misfortune to the sky.
<lb/>Know that both ill and good proceed from Him
<lb/>That hath no peer—the One eternal Cause,
<lb/>Whose word is ‘Be’ and what He willeth is,
<lb/>Who was and is and will be evermore.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“The body is the hostel of the soul:
<lb/>Which of them feeleth pain?” the archmage asked.
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Our mortal bodies suffer
<lb/>So long as they have brains, but when the soul
<lb/>Hath filtered through they lose their consciousness,
<lb/>And when it hath departed are dissolved.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archmage questioned him on self-control:—
<lb/><q>In what way can we hide our greed and need?</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>’Tis fitting that the sage
<lb/>Suppress them, yet thou ever wilt be vexed
<lb/>By greed because ne’er satiate of treasure.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Among the kings of yore,
<lb/>The men of sense, rede, faith, and precedent,
<lb/>Whom knowest thou as subject of our praise,
<lb/>When he is dead, O monarch of the earth?</q>
<lb/>“That great king,” this was Nushirwan’s reply,
</p>

<pb n="38"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Who is a worshipper of God and pure,
<lb/>And thankful to the righteous Lord of all,
<lb/>Who filleth none with fear of tyranny,
<lb/>Who giveth to the good a hopeful heart,
<lb/>And to the bad a heart of fear and pain,
<lb/>Who furnisheth his troops from his own treasures,
<lb/>And turneth on malignants their own ill,
<lb/>Who questioneth the sages of the world,
<lb/>And keepeth from his foes his bad and good.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Wherein consisteth worship,
<lb/>And who approacheth to God’s holiness?</q>
<lb/>“The subtle will direct,” the Shah replied,
<lb/><q>His soul as by fine hair-breadths and first know
<lb/>The being and the unity of God,
<lb/>Which small instruction will make evident,
<lb/>And he will offer thanks for mercies given,
<lb/>While putting trust in God and fearing Him,
<lb/>Who is thy terror when thou seekest ill,
<lb/>Thy trust when thou dost well. If thou art sound
<lb/>Of Faith and seek’st the Way all will esteem thee,
<lb/>While if thou art malign and ill-disposed
<lb/>Thy soul hath forwarded its packs to Hell.
<lb/>Feel not at home with this world for 'twil hold

<lb/>For what we have on earth will pass away,
<lb/>And reason counteth them no joys at all.
<lb/>Mayst thou incline to sense and rede. Let wisdom
<lb/>Guide thee to God. Speak not unmeasured words,
<lb/>For thou’rt new-fangled and the world is old.
</q>
</p>

<pb n="39"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Be drunk not with the pleasures of the day.
<lb/>Choose not the company of wicked men.
<lb/>Refrain thy heart from what can never be,
<lb/>And give such largess as 'tis fit to give.
<lb/>Withhold not from a friend aught that thou hast,
<lb/>Though he should ask thine eyes, thy brains, and skin,
<lb/>And if two friends would take account together
<lb/>No daysman should be needed for that task.
<lb/>If thou associate with a foe so act
<lb/>That he may not obtain a hold upon thee.
<lb/>When one doth seek the path of right his need
<lb/>Is parts, humility, and gentleness.
<lb/>Let not thy tongue exaggerate thy merits,
<lb/>For falsehood is no merit with the just,
<lb/>Who hold one’s high estate a thing of naught,
<lb/>Another’s poverty no mark for scorn.
<lb/>If some malicious person talk with thee
<lb/>Let not his malice anger thee, and then,
<lb/>When, being well assured that thou art weak,
<lb/>He useth language that is past all bounds,
<lb/>Reply to him in measured terms and speak
<lb/>Words goodly and well-liking. If it be
<lb/>That thou canst bring him to himself by kindness
<lb/>He will repent his former speech. Devote not
<lb/>Thy leisure to indulgence. Idleness
<lb/>Is naught if thou art wise. Be diligent
<lb/>In all thine undertakings and give ear
<lb/>To knowledge. Enter on no enterprise
<lb/>Whereof the end will cause remorse or anger.
<lb/>Have pity on the sad in his distress;
<lb/>Bring not his heart to anguish and disaster.
<lb/>The sage that traineth his own heart to patience

<p>
<lb/><q>For increase from a friend is laudable,

<head>PART VI: THE SHAH’S LAST YEARS</head>

<div>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>

The poet tells of the last war of Nushirwan against Rum and of the Shah’s transaction with a shoemaker, the appointment of his son Hurmuzd as his successor after that prince had been questioned by Buzurjmihr, the Shah’s testament and last counsels to his son, his dream of the advent of Muhammad, and the death of the Shah and of Buzurjmihr.
</div>
<div>
<head>NOTE</head>

<p>§§ 1-3. After ten years of peace war again broke out between the Persian and Roman empires in A.D. 572. The
Shahnama is correct in representing that the latter was to blame for the renewal of hostilities. The Emperor Justin
II., who had succeeded his uncle Justinian in A.D. 565, wanted war. The scene of operations covered much the same ground as on the previous occasion. The Persians made a raid into
Syria, recorded in the Shahnama by the mention of Halab
(Chalybon-Beroea, Aleppo), and an unsuccessful attack on
Antioch. The Romans, under Marcian (Batarun), the prefect of the East, besieged Nisibis, held by the Persians ever since its cession to Shapur, son of Hurmuz (Sapor II.), by Jovian in A.D. 363. Nushirwan raised the siege, drove the Romans into the stronghold of Dara on the foot-hills of Mount Masius, and besieged them there. After a gallant defence the fortress fell late in A.D. 573.<note n="1">For Dara see GDF. v. 86 and note.</note> Mount Masius seems to be the Mount
Talikan of the Shahnama, the scene of one of Gushtasp’s exploits during his exile in Rum.<note n="2">See Vol. iv. p. 342 seq.</note> Justin on this resigned the direction

<pb n="42"/> of affairs to Tiberius who to gain time purchased a temporary suspension of hostilities from the Persians. This is represented in the Shahnama as the conclusion of peace and as a triumph for Nushirwan but historically the war was still in progress at the time of his death four years later, and the
Great King, shortly before the end of his reign, had to make a somewhat hasty and ignominious retirement to Ctesiphon.<note n="3">RSM, p. 437.</note></p>

<p>§ 2. We have already met with the cobbler or shoemaker, introduced as characteristic of a type, in the Shahnama.<note n="4">See Vol. vii. pp. 24, 260.</note></p>

<p>§§ 4-6. See p. 3.</p>

<p>§7. P. omits this section which of course comes from
Muhammadan sources. Though interpolated into Persian story it does not seem to be an interpolation in Firdausi’s
Shahnama for there appears to be no good reason for supposing that the passage was written by a hand other than that poet’s. A similar account appears both in the Persian and
Arabic Tabari.<note n="5">ZT, li. 235, NT, p. 253.</note>
</p><p>

The ascent of two score degrees is intended to indicate that
Muhammad was forty years old when he received his “call.”
</p><p>

Muhammad, having been challenged by idolaters to divide the moon in twain, is said to have pointed his finger at it, on which it was at once divided into two parts, one of which remained stationary while the other was concealed behind
a mountain. Another tradition says that Mount Hira intervened between the two halves. Travellers from a distance when questioned reported that they had observed the same phenomenon.<note n="6">KM, Pt. II. Vol. ii. p. 753.</note> The passage in the Quran on which the traditions are based runs as follows:—“The hour hath approached and the MOON hath been cleft:
</p><p>

But whenever they see a miracle they turn aside and say,
</p><p>

This is well-devised magic.”<note n="7">RK, p. 74.</note>

The Sura in which the quotation occurs is known as “THE MOON.”

<head>§ 1 How Nushirwan made ready to war against Caesar
<lb/>It is recorded in the ancient book</head>
<p>

<lb/>From the recital of a truthful sage
<lb/>That when news came from Rum to this fair land
<lb/>For Nushirwan, the world-lord: “Mayst thou live,
<lb/>For Caesar is no more and to another
<lb/>Hath yielded time and earth,” death filled his soul
<lb/>With care; his ruddy countenance became
<lb/>Like yellow leaves. He chose out of Iran
<lb/>An envoy of experience and high birth,
<lb/>And then dispatched him unto Caesar’s son,
<lb/>Dispatched him to that fresh and fruitful Bough,
<lb/>First charging him with many kindly words,
<lb/>And saying: “’Tis an evil none can ’scape.”
<lb/>He wrote a letter in distress and grief,
<lb/>With eyes all tearful and cheeks sallow, thus:—
<lb/>“God grant thee life and loving-kindliness
<lb/>Now that thy sire is dead. No living thing
<lb/>Is born unless to die. A Wayside Inn
<lb/>Is this and we pass on. Although we handle
<lb/>The crown or helm and casque we find no quittance
<lb/>From death’s clutch. What is Caesar or the Khan
<lb/>When his time cometh and all suddenly
<lb/>Shall lay his head in dust? Mayst thou receive
<lb/>No lack of joyful tidings of thy sire;
<lb/>May Christ befriend his soul. Now I have heard
<lb/>That thou art seated on his famous throne,
<lb/>And hast adorned the fortune that was his.
<lb/>Require of us such strength as thou dost need
<lb/>Of steeds, of arms, of treasure, and of troops.”
<lb/>The ambassador went forth from Nushirwan;
<lb/>He made the journey in all haste to Caesar,
</p>

<pb n="44"/>

<p>
<lb/>And, when he reached the court, they gave him entry;
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah approached the state.
<lb/>When Caesar saw the title on the scroll
<lb/>His heart swelled at the pride of Nushirwan.
<lb/>He was a hasty youth, new to the throne,
<lb/>Showed himself overbearing to the envoy,
<lb/>Saluted him in an unseemly fashion,
<lb/>With lax observance and discourtesy,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1775"/>
<lb/>Gave him a lodging distant from the court,
<lb/>And took no notice of the Great King’s letter.
<lb/>A week passed, Caesar’s counsellors assembled,
<lb/>And he addressed their leader: “Now consider
<lb/>The answer to this letter, draw it up,
<lb/>As thou dost know to do, in fitting terms,
<lb/>And set forth good and ill.”
<lb/>The priest replied:—
<lb/>“Thy liege am I and will obey the world-lord.”
<lb/>So all the bishops, priests, and counsellors
<lb/>Assembled by themselves apart and then
<lb/>Wrote with all speed a letter in response,
<lb/>As Caesar bade, and first they praised the Maker,
<lb/>And based their praise on wisdom, then they said:—
<lb/>“Was such a letter worthy of the Shah,
<lb/>A letter graceless and malevolent?
<lb/>Thou dost amiss for Caesar is but young,
<lb/>But lately crowned, our king in right of birth.
<lb/>Forbear to press the youth for this one year
<lb/>With haughty superscriptions, tax and toll.
<lb/>The youth hath written in befitting terms
<lb/>To all the lieges and the potentates,
<lb/>As the illustrious emperor of Rum,
<lb/>To whom the mountain-tops are so much wax.
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah hath come to us,
<lb/>And he will tell the Shah what he hath seen
<lb/>With us—our words of grief and joy alike:
</p>

<pb n="45"/>

<p>
<lb/>Our weal and woe shall not remain concealed.
<lb/>One Caesar hath departed but another
<lb/>Succeeded who exalteth o’er all chiefs
<lb/>His head without regard to any king
<lb/>Among the underlords and overlords.”
<lb/>When they were ready with that Roman letter
<lb/>They summoned the ambassador to court.
<lb/>That sage, on hearing that they were advised,
<lb/>Came to the court and asked for the response.
<lb/>They made him ready an unworthy robe
<lb/>Of honour and put strangers from the hall.
<lb/>Then Caesar said to him: “No slave am I,
<lb/>The inferior of the Haitalians and Chin.
<lb/>One should not lightly treat a potentate
<lb/>Although thy Shah be Great King in the world.
<lb/>He that hath many enemies is great,
<lb/>And I have foes and friends upon my skirts.
<lb/>Why dost thou scant me of my majesty,
<lb/>And cloud my sun? Thou, when such need is mine,
<lb/>Shalt be my king, my father’s memory.
<lb/>Make fair report of thine experience here,
<lb/>And seek no foul intent in my response.”
<lb/>They put the robe of honour on the sage,
<lb/>And called the marchlord’s roadster to the door.
<lb/>He parted hastily and, tarrying not
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1776"/>
<lb/>At any stage, reached Nushirwan and told
<lb/>What he had seen and heard and what had passed.
<lb/>The Shah was sorry at the words and said:—
<lb/>“Thou hast had fruit of travel. I have heard
<lb/>That whosoever indulgeth his self-will,
<lb/>Not thinking what he doth, will smart therefor.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>If he discerneth not 'twixt friend and foe
<lb/>In telling thus the secret of his heart
<lb/>To thee I ween too that he is no friend
<lb/>To us and, further, hath not blood and feet
<lb/>And skin. By holy God, by sun and moon,
</p>

<pb n="46"/>

<p>
<lb/>By crown and throne and by Azargashasp,
<lb/>I swear that if I leave of Ruman race
<lb/>A single man in joy upon the throne
<lb/>I am not of the race of bold Kubad,
<lb/>And in men’s presence never mention me.
<lb/>Henceforth will I make black the fame of Rum,
<lb/>And set the cultivated parts a-blaze.
<lb/>Moreover, he shall fill the ox-skins for us
<lb/>With all the gems and treasures of his realm,
<lb/>And my sword’s point shall touch not sheath until
<lb/>I have my heart’s desire upon this Ruman,
<lb/>Who arrogantly boasteth: ‘I am Caesar,’
<lb/>As though I were but ‘one among his chiefs!’
<lb/>He bade the clarions and the Indian bells
<lb/>And gongs be sounded at the palace-gate,
<lb/>And bound upon his mighty elephants
<lb/>The kettledrums. The world was indigo
<lb/>With dust. A host that made the green sea <note n="1">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 174 and note.</note> quail
<lb/>Marched forth from Mada’in toward the waste,
<lb/>While at the blare of trump, the gleam <note n="2">Reading with P.</note> of flag,
<lb/>And stir of horsemen in their golden boots,
<lb/>Thou wouldest have declared: ‘The stars are drowned,
<lb/>And all revolving heaven is astound!’
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When tidings came to Caesar of the Shah:—
<lb/>"He hath marched forth in anger from Iran,"
<lb/>He set forth from 'Ammuriya<note n="1">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 23 and note.</note> to Halab;
</p>

<pb n="47"/>

<p>
<lb/>The world was filled with tumult, bruit, and din.
<lb/>Three hundred thousand horsemen of Iran
<lb/>Besieged the fortress of Halab. Troops gathered
<lb/>From every side and tarried not from strife.
<lb/>The warrior-prelates of the Roman host
<lb/>Set up their catapults on every side.<note n="2">Cf. Vol. i. p. 373.</note>
<lb/>The Iranians took the stronghold of Sakila,
<lb/>For from that region they would fain attack;
<lb/>Halab became as 'twere a sea of blood,
<lb/>And all the host of Batarun sought quarter;
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1977"/>
<lb/>Unnumbered Romans perished 'neath the arrows,
<lb/>And many were ta'en prisoners in the fight.
<lb/>Within two se'nnights the Iranians brought
<lb/>Some thirty thousand captives to the king.
<lb/>The Romans dug a trench before their host,
<lb/>And let the water in at break of day.
<lb/>They barred the Shah's advance; he and his troops
<lb/>Were at a stand in fight. He called to him
<lb/>His commissaries and discussed with them
<lb/>The posture of the war at large and said
<lb/>Thus: "This hath grown a matter of much toil:
<lb/>We cannot pass the water and the fosse.
<lb/>The troops have need of money and supplies,
<lb/>As well as horses, mail, and Roman helms."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The commissaries, scribes, and treasurers
<lb/>Of that world-lord went the treasury,
<lb/>Which, as the number of his soldiers stood,
<lb/>Was in dinars three hundred thousand short.<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>An archmage came to the Shah like dust,
<lb/>And told him what the treasury lacked, whereat
<lb/>The Shah's face gloomed. He ordered Buzurjmihr
<lb/>To come, and said to him: "With treasury void
<lb/>What booteth me the throne of king of kings?
<lb/>Go, call the camel-drivers, and dispatch
<lb/>Some Bactrian camels on the road and take
</p>

<pb n="48"/>

<p>
<lb/>Out of the treasures of Mazandaran
<lb/>A hundred loads and upwards of dinars."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>But Buzurjmihr made answer to the world-lord:—
<lb/>"O just, wise, loving Shah! the way is long
<lb/>To reach the treasures of Iran, the while
<lb/>Our troops are destitute and at a stand;
<lb/>But in the cities round about are those,
<lb/>A hundredth of whose wealth would pay our troops.
<lb/>If thou shalt ask the merchants and the thanes
<lb/>To make advances they will not refuse."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah was in this matter of a mind
<lb/>With what the wise man of Iran had said,
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr chose out a messenger,
<lb/>Wise, of a cheerful heart, and goodly face,
<lb/>And said to him: "Go with a second horse,
<lb/>And choose thee out some lusty notable
<lb/>Among the merchants and the thanes—a man
<lb/>Of mighty reputation—and request
<lb/>A loan of money for the troops. The Shah
<lb/>Will order money to be sent with speed
<lb/>Out of the treasury."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That emissary,
<lb/>Fair-spoken, young in years but old in wisdom
<lb/>And shrewd, came to a neighbouring town and asked
<lb/>A loan of money for the king's affairs,
<lb/>And round him gathered many of the rich.
<lb/>A certain man, who made and vended shoes,
<lb/>Attended closely to the envoy's words,
<lb/>And asked: "How much?"
<lb/>The gallant envoy told,

<p>
<lb/>How the Envoys of Caesar came to Nushirwan with
<lb/>Apologies and Presents
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Whenas from Pisces Sol displayed its crown,
<lb/>And flung a robe of ivory o’er the earth,
<lb/>The scouts returning from the trench-edge came
<lb/>Before the exalted Shah and said to him:—
<lb/>“An embassage from Caesar hath arrived
<lb/>In tribulation to excuse his faults.”
<lb/>The ambassador approached immediately
<lb/>With benedictions upon Nushirwan,
<lb/>On seeing whose head and crown the Roman heaved
<lb/>A cold sigh, thinking: “Lo! a Shah exalted
<lb/>With kingship, manhood, and a mighty host!”
<lb/>Two score philosophers of Rum, whose tongues
<lb/>Were full of utterance and their hearts of sighs,
<lb/>Brought, each one, thirty thousand in dinars
<lb/>As offerings to the king. When they beheld
<lb/>His comely countenance they came lamenting,
<lb/>And writhing serpent-like. The king of kings,
<lb/>On seeing them, received them graciously,
<lb/>Assigning them the customary seats,
<lb/>And then their spokesman thus addressed him:
<lb/>“Caesar,
<lb/>O Shah! is young and hath but just acceded;
<lb/>His sire is dead, the world is new to him,
<lb/>And he is unacquainted with affairs.
<lb/>Now we are all of us thy tributaries,
<lb/>And servants, and are under thy protection.
<lb/>For thee Rum is Iran, Iran is Rum;
<lb/>Why then distinguish them? The king of kings
<lb/>Hath all the age’s wisdom for his own,
</p>

<pb n="52"/>

<p>
<lb/>And straighteneth Caesar’s back. The Khan of Chin,
<lb/>The king of Hind, are glad in him and help
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1780"/>
<lb/>To grace his throne. Although a youth, not yet
<lb/>Of man’s estate, made utterance ill-advised
<lb/>Let not the king of kings, in whom the vault
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli rejoiceth, take
<lb/>Revenge thereat or dudgeon. We will pay
<lb/>The tribute laid on Rum from the beginning,
<lb/>And keep pact.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Smiling at the envoy’s words
<lb/>Said Nushirwan: “Although the boy be noble
<lb/>His speech hath little wisdom. What is Caesar?
<lb/>What Batarun, the insensate one, whose tongue
<lb/>Hath caused his soul’s abasement? All the wise
<lb/>Born of Sikandar’s stock have proved triumphant,
<lb/>And eminent, yet if one doeth not
<lb/>Our bidding but rejecteth our advice
<lb/>And our alliance, from his peopled realm
<lb/>Will we send up the dust and will not fear
<lb/>His treasures and his troops.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The envoys kissed
<lb/>The ground, as courtiers use, and made reply:—
<lb/>“O Shah that art victorious and supreme!
<lb/>Blame not the past. We are thy travail’s dust,
<lb/>The warders of thy treasure. When the king
<lb/>Shall take us into favour we shall cease
<lb/>Both from misfortune and from discontent.
<lb/>The toils that here the king of kings hath borne
<lb/>Are no small matter in the Romans’ eyes,
<lb/>And we will pay, by way of toll and tax,
<lb/>His treasury ten ox-hides of dinars.
<lb/>‘Tis thine to bid us pay thee less or more,
<lb/>And to accept it though it be unworthy.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>"As touching treasure,” thus the Shah replied,
<lb/>"The matter resteth with my minister.”
</p>

<pb n="53"/>

<p>
<lb/>Then all the Romans went before that archmage,
<lb/>Went with loud lamentations and ill-starred,
<lb/>Used every plea at large, told Caesar’s purpose,
<lb/>Informed him of the ox-hides and dinars,
<lb/>And matters that concerned the peace of Rum.
<lb/>The archmage answered thus: “Ye give the gold,
<lb/>But what brocade will ye present as well?
</p>
<p>
<lb/>What time the king returneth he will need
<lb/>A thousand pieces of gold-woven brocade,
<lb/>For he is constantly concerned with gifts
<lb/>Of robes of honour for his lords and lieges.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Romans gave consent thereto and then
<lb/>Returning did obeisance to the Shah.
<lb/>He tarried on the battlefield awhile.
<lb/>Then when the king and host had taken rest
<lb/>He chose among the troops a warrior—
<lb/>One of ability in ciphering—<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>And gave him soldiers that he might demand
<lb/>The Roman tribute and convey it home.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1781"/>

<pb n="54"/>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah departed thence toward Taisafun
<lb/>With troops behind him and in front of him,
<lb/>All furnished well with silver and with gold,
<lb/>With silvern bridles and with golden girdles.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“The air is silken all,” thou wouldst have said,
<lb/>“With all the silken banners of the chiefs,
<lb/>While hills and plains are golden and the belts
<lb/>Are like the Pleiades with jewelry.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When he drew near the city on his march
<lb/>A multitude went out to welcome him.
<lb/>All came to Nushirwan afoot with loins
<lb/>Girt up for service and with open hearts,
<lb/>While all that had accompanied the Shah
<lb/>Proceeded to the palace-gate afoot,
<lb/>And all the mighty chieftains called down blessings
<lb/>Upon that Shah alert and just and holy,
</p>
<p>
<lb/>While those of greatest eminence brought gifts
<lb/>Of precious stones. The Shah, on his return,
<lb/>Made manifest his power to all the chiefs,
<lb/>And then the warriors went home. There came

<p>
<lb/>How Nushirwan chose Hurmuzd as his Successor
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The high-souled minstrel, who instructeth me,
<lb/>What said he of time’s mutability?
<lb/>“No prudent sage will set his mind and heart
<lb/>Upon this Hostel whence we must depart,
<lb/>For we arise and fall from day to day,
<lb/>And alternate our joyance with dismay.
<lb/>Dark earth will be our final resting-place,
<lb/>This with high honour, that with deep disgrace,
<lb/>And after they depart they tell us not
<lb/>If wakeful joy or slumber be their lot;
<lb/>Still if they flourish not that pass our ken
<lb/>At least they will not strive with death again.
<lb/>In contemplation of that day of awe
<lb/>What are five years and twenty or five score,
<lb/>Passed by one man in pleasure and delight,
<lb/>Passed by another in penurious plight?
<lb/>None have I seen that had a wish to die
<lb/>Among the upright or the waywardly,
<lb/>But all are shocked at death—the pious one,
<lb/>Just as the idol-serving Ahriman.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Old man! when three score years and one have past,
</p>

<pb n="55"/>

<p>
<lb/>Wine, cup, and rest grow savourless at last,
<lb/>Yet wine for one that readieth to die
<lb/>Is as a wool-coat when ’tis winterly,<note>Literally "In (the month of) Dai.”</note>
<lb/>When body freezeth in the midst of vice,
<lb/>And soul hath lost its way to Paradise.
<lb/>Full many a friend hath lagged or passed away,
<lb/>But in the waste the cup with thee will stay.
</p>
<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1782"/>
<lb/>Unless thy life’s endeavour thou forecast
<lb/>Sure retribution will be thine at last.
<lb/>Ill-doing endeth in calamity;
<lb/>If thou dost ill the world will sadden thee.
<lb/>Joy not in evil that thou hast achieved,
<lb/>Who, grieving others, shalt thyself be grieved.
<lb/>Know that, however great may be the sum
<lb/>Of these thine earthly years, thine end will come;
<lb/>So multiply thy good deeds here below
<lb/>That thou mayst gladden when thou hast to go.
<lb/>The deeds accomplished and the words let fall
<lb/>In life will serve as our memorial.
<lb/>I ask of God from time, its Maker He,
<lb/>For such a respite, such felicity,
<lb/>That all these many tales and stories told,
<lb/>Now over-passed by years and waxen old,
<lb/>From Gaiumart to Yazdagird, which be
<lb/>In disarray, may be arrayed by me;
<lb/>That I may range them, weed that garth, and tell
<lb/>Anew what hap the kings of kings befell,
<lb/>Then verily I shall not grieve when I
<lb/>Shall have to quit this Wayside Hostelry.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And now what saith the man of ardent soul
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, the world-lord’s, purposes?
<lb/>The monarch at the age of seventy-four
<lb/>Became possessed by thoughts of death and sought
<lb/>A master for the world whose chiefest aim
<lb/>Should be to clothe him in the robe of justice,
</p>

<pb n="56"/>

<p>
<lb/>Display compassion to the mendicants,
<lb/>Be great, untroubled, and of ardent soul.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He had six sons of noble birth who all
<lb/>Were great, shrewd-hearted, and of kingly mien,
<lb/>With valour, learning, self-control and counsel,
<lb/>Young with a love of knowledge, and of these
<lb/>The wisest and the eldest was Hurmuzd,
<lb/>The nobly born, a man unparalleled,
<lb/>Exalted, knowing, fair of countenance,
<lb/>And well affected to the noble race.<note>i.e., the Persians. Hurmuzd was half Turkish by birth—the son of the daughter of the Khan. See pp. 87, 97 seq.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah gave orders to his officers
<lb/>To test the disposition of his son,
<lb/>By day and night to mark his utterances,
<lb/>And to inform the monarch of the world
<lb/>Of his proceedings whether good or bad.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>At that time said the Shah to Buzurjmihr:—
<lb/>“I have a secret purpose in my mind.
<lb/>When I exceeded three score years and ten
<lb/>My musky tresses took a camphor-hue,
<lb/>And when I quit this Wayside Hostelry
<lb/>A master will be needed for the world,
<lb/>Who will give largess to the mendicant,
<lb/>The stranger, and the man of his own kindred,
<lb/>Be bounteous, will refrain from love of treasure,
<lb/>And set his heart not on this Wayside Inn—
<lb/>One whose whole purpose ever is toward good,
<lb/>Whose place is on the Shah’s throne. I thank God
</p>

<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1783"/>
<lb/>That I have sons wise, learned, who worship Him,
<lb/>And none esteem I dearer than Hurmuzd,
<lb/>Or more pre-eminent for rede and sense.
<lb/>Of mercy, generosity, and right
<lb/>I see naught lacking in his heart at all.
<lb/>So summon now the archmages and the chiefs,
<lb/>All that observe the way of understanding,
</p>

<pb n="57"/>

<p>
<lb/>Prove ye his knowledge and thereby present
<lb/>Accomplishment upon accomplishment.”
</p>
</div>

<div><head>§ 5</head>
<p>
<lb/>How the Archimages questioned Hurmuzd and how he replied
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archimages, the investigators,
<lb/>And counsellors assembled, called to them
<lb/>Hurmuzd, the atheling, and seated him
<lb/>Among the chiefs. Then Buzurjmihr began:
<lb/>“O prince fair-starred and fair to look upon!
<lb/>What know’st thou that will brighten the pure soul
<lb/>And wisdom, and be fruitful for the body?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: “Knowledge is the best, for great
<lb/>Among the great is one of understanding.
<lb/>In knowledge is man’s safety; it restraineth
<lb/>The hands of Ahriman from ill, and next
<lb/>Come patience and munificence whereby
<lb/>The body gaineth fame and ease.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The sage
<lb/>Then asked: “What showeth virtue to advantage,
<lb/>And what will raise a man to high estate?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Hurmuzd replied: “First, to be courteous
<lb/>To all in good and ill; next, to endeavour
<lb/>To grieve as little as one can the hearts
<lb/>Of every one; and, thirdly, to deal justly
<lb/>Within the world and so gain self-content.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>On that pure-hearted prince of goodly mien
<lb/>Gazed Buzurjmihr, the questioner, and said:
<lb/>“Now will I speak concerning needful topics.
<lb/>Count them upon thy hands, remember all
<lb/>That I shall ask, and make a just response
<lb/>To them in that same order. Bring to bear
</p>

<lb/>Art heedful of such matters, of a truth

<lb/>At large that I may have response in full.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Master of the world instruct thee! May
<lb/>Thy wit be bright, good fortune by thy mate.
<lb/>Now will I question thee of what I know
<lb/>With fairness. Answer as thy knowledge is.
<lb/>The wise man is discerned by his replies,
<lb/>And compasseth his will in everything.

<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1784"/>
<lb/>Inquiry is the lock, response the key;
<lb/>Response discriminateth bad from good.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Who is the child dear in his father’s eyes,
<lb/>Fair of behaviour, and without offence?
<lb/>What man is worthy of our heart’s compassion,
<lb/>So that one needs must weep at his distress?
<lb/>What man repenteth of his own good deed,
<lb/>And that too from the bottom of his heart?
<lb/>Who is the man deserving of my blame
<lb/>When I shall make inquiry of his acts?
<lb/>Who would do better if he shunned the world
<lb/>Because his quiet days are at an end?
<lb/>What maketh for our happiness in life,
<lb/>And what do we recall most willingly?
<lb/>Which is the time to praise? What profiteth
<lb/>Us most? Who is the dearest of our friends,
<lb/>Whose voice doth make a pleasance of the heart?
<lb/>Who is the man with most friends in the world,
<lb/>That joy in him in public and in private?
<lb/>Who too is he that hath most enemies,
<lb/>And most malignantly disposed to him?<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>What is the thing, the most injurious,
<lb/>For which when done there is good cause to weep?
<lb/>Of all the things that mortals cherish here
<lb/>What is the most unstable of them all?
</p>

<pb n="59"/>

<p>
<lb/>Who is the tyrant that is unashamed,
<lb/>The man most loveless and irreverent?
<lb/>Whose words produce most ruin in the world,
<lb/>And cause the greatest trouble to his friends?
<lb/>What is the matter that entaileth shame,
<lb/>And evil on a man through his own words?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>For one whole day till night rose o’er the hills
<lb/>The sage’s words produced no weariness,
<lb/>But when the darkness brought the time for lights
<lb/>The chiefs’ heads darkened with bewilderment,
<lb/>And, when the Shah grew weary of his words,
<lb/>He paused for a reply. The great Hurmuzd
<lb/>Rose to his feet and fitly praised the Shah:
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“Ne’er may the Shah be lacking to the world,
<lb/>But still abide upon the imperial throne;
<lb/>Ne’er may we see the crown, the royal state,
<lb/>And throne of ivory, devoid of thee;
<lb/>In their excusings may the strong be dust
<lb/>Before thee, heaven thine antidote from harm.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now will I make reply to Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>And solve his questions with a right good will.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The sage first questioned me concerning sons,
<lb/>And so it is with them I must begin.
<lb/>A son doth make his father glad of heart,
<lb/>And freeth it from griefs, if he affect
<lb/>His sire, incline to goodness, and be just.
</p>
<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1785"/>
<lb/>Next, of the pitiable man, for whom
<lb/>The eyelids drop their tears: this is the magnate
<lb/>Whose fortune hath been scattered and he now
<lb/>Is thrall to one unworthy. This man’s case
<lb/>Is one to be deplored with bitterness,
<lb/>Because he hath a miscreant for his lord.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Again, the man that doeth benefits
<lb/>To thankless folk is all solicitude,
<lb/>And one forgetful of good done to him
<lb/>Would make a fool of wisdom. Then the sage

<lb/>The wise man is at liberty to quit

<lb/>Because he bringeth Doomsday on the world.
<lb/>The sage inquired: ‘In what rejoicest thou?’

<lb/>Of the victorious monarch of the world,
<lb/>Put into verse this act of Nushirwan’s.
<lb/>The world in practice doth belie its show ;
<lb/>Beneath ’tis naught but dolour and chagrin,
<lb/>But, whether thou hast crown or toil and woe,
<lb/>Thou ne’ertheless must quit this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>Peruse a letter of the kings of yore,
<lb/>And see if Nushirwan hath any peer
<lb/>For justice, rede, festivity, and war,
<lb/>Yet, his day done, he found no tarriance here.
<lb/>So turn from feast and pleasure, and be wise,
<lb/>Thou agéd dotard and impenitent !
<lb/>The world may still look freshly to thine eyes
<lb/>When in thy cups thou scornest to repent ;
<lb/>Yet still, if thou be wise, repent anon ;
<lb/>The man of Faith is well advised for aye ;
<lb/>The seasons of thine age will soon be gone,
<lb/>Spring, Summer-tide, and Autumn pass away !
<lb/>Then when thy body is in dust below
<lb/>Think whither that pure soul of thine will go!
<lb/>What was it that the agéd chronicler
<lb/>Said of the testament of Nushirwan ?

<p>
<lb/>When the responses of Hurmuzd were ended
<lb/>The high priest entered on a new discourse.
<lb/>The Shah bade, and the counsellors and scribes
<lb/>Wrote out on silk a gracious document
<lb/>From Nushirwan to young Hurmuzd, beginning
<lb/>With praise of the All-just and then proceeding :—
<lb/>“This counsel of the offspring of Kubad
<lb/>Hear graciously and write upon thy heart,
<lb/>Which haply through these words of mine may live.
<lb/>Know that this world is faithless, O my son!
<lb/>And full of toil and trouble, pain and bale.

<p>
<lb/>Whenever thou art joying therein and when
<lb/>Thy heart is free from time’s distemperature
<lb/>That happiness hath no abiding-place,
<lb/>And thou must quit this Wayside Hostelry.
<lb/>As I resign the world to thee with justice
<lb/>Thou must thyself resign it to another.
<lb/>Since both by bright day and by longsome night
<lb/>My thoughts are busied with mine own departure
<lb/>I seek a head fit for the royal crown
<lb/>To be a diadem on every head.
<lb/>We have six sons—the Lustre of our heart— .
<lb/>Wise, generous, and just. We have made choice
<lb/>Of thee because thou art the eldest-born,
<lb/>A wise man and the adornment of the crown.
<lb/>Kubad, the well beloved, had four score years
<lb/>What time he spake to me of sovereignty ;
<lb/>Now I have come to seventy years and four,
<lb/>And I have made thee monarch in the world.
<lb/>Herein mine aim hath been but peace and weal
<lb/>So that I might have worship after death.
<lb/>My hope is that almighty God will make thee
<lb/>All glad and fortunate. If by thy justice
<lb/>Folk are secure through thee thou wilt thyself
<lb/>Repose in peace, glad through thine own just dealing,
<lb/>And for thy good works done win Paradise,
<lb/>For he is blest that sowed but seed of good.
<lb/>See that thou ne’er lose patience; haste is ill
<lb/>In kings. The world-lord that is shrewd and learned
<lb/>Will be in estimation all his years.
<lb/>In no way go about to compass lies,
<lb/>Else will the visage of thy fortune pale.
<lb/>Keep haste afar both from thy heart and brain ;
<lb/>The wisdom that is joined to haste will slumber.
<lb/>Incline toward the good and strive therefor,
<lb/>And list the sage’s rede in weal and woe.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Ill must not compass thee about, for ill
<lb/>Will verily result in ill to thee.
<lb/>Let both thy raiment and thy food be pure,
<lb/>And keep thy father’s counsels still in mind.
<lb/>Make God thy refuge and incline to Him
<lb/>As thou wouldst have Him for thy guide. When thou
<lb/>Shalt make the world all prosperous by thy justice
<lb/>Thy treasury will prosper, fortune joy
<lb/>In thee. Reward men when they act aright ;
<lb/>Wait not till good men’s toil hath waxen old.
<lb/>Make glad the men of parts and have them near thee,
<lb/>But keep the world dark to the ill-disposed.
<lb/>In all affairs take counsel with the sage,
<lb/>And fret not at the toils of sovereignty.
<lb/>Whenas the wise hath access to thee, throne
<lb/>With troops and treasure will continue thine.
<lb/>As for thy subjects, suffer none of them
<lb/>To be in cheerless case. The potentates
<lb/>And nobles of thy realm must all partake
<lb/>Thy good, but let the ignoble share it not,
<lb/>And trust not aught to one that is unjust.
<lb/>Give all thine ear and heart to mendicants,
<lb/>And let their sorrows be thy sorrows too.
<lb/>The chief that of his own accord is just
<lb/>Will please the world as well as please himself.
<lb/>Bar not thy treasury to men of worth,
<lb/>But act with bounty to the virtuous ;
<lb/>Still if thine enemy become thy friend
<lb/>Sow not thy seed of good on that salt soil.
<lb/>If thou shalt follow this advice of ours
<lb/>Thy crown will be exalted evermore.
<lb/>May He that giveth good wish well to thee,
<lb/>Thy throne be wisdom and thy crown success.</p>

<lb/>Though thou be far removed from my sight.
<lb/>May thy head flourish and thy heart be glad,
<lb/>Thy person pure and far from hurt of foes.
<lb/>May wisdom be thy watchman evermore,
<lb/>And righteousness the subject of thy thoughts.
<lb/>When I shall pass away from this wide world
<lb/>A goodly palace must be built for me,

<lb/>And where the swift-winged vulture flieth not<note>This is not at all in accord to Parsi notions. Cf. Vol. i. p. 81 s.u. Dakhma.</note>—

<div><head>§ 7
How Nushirwan had a Dream and how Buzurjmihr interpreted it as signifying the Appearance of
Muhammad</head>
<p>
<lb/>In that year Nushirwan upon a night
<lb/>Amidst his prayers and praises had a dream,
<lb/>Wherein his lucid spirit saw in sleep
<lb/>A Sun rise in the night and therewithal
<lb/>Was an ascent that had two score degrees,
<lb/>Whose summit reached to Saturn in the ascendant.
<lb/>From the Hijaz in stately pomp and joy
<lb/>That Sun ascended that ascent, fulfilling
<lb/>The world with brilliancy from Kaf to Kaf,<note>Kaf=Alburz. See Vol. i. p. 71.</note>
<lb/>And everywhere converting grief to mirth,
<lb/>While all the horizons, whether far or near,
<lb/>Took lustre from its glory everywhere,
<lb/>And everywhere light entered save the hall
<lb/>Of Nushirwan which still abode in gloom.
<lb/>The Shah rose from his sleep for half the night,
<lb/>And oped his lips to none on that affair,
</p>

<pb n="67"/>

<p>
<lb/>But when the sun unveiled its countenance,
<lb/>He summoned to his presence Buzurjmihr.
<lb/>The king of kings in private to that sage
<lb/>Related what he had beheld in sleep,
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr, possessed of all the case,
<lb/>Considered all the dream from end to end,
<lb/>And thus replied: "O king of power supreme!
<lb/>In truth there is a mystery herein.’
<lb/>The king said: “Speak the truth because my life
<lb/>Is failing in my body for suspense.”
<lb/>Then Buzurjmihr spake thus: ‘O thou whose rede
<lb/>Is higher than moon and sun! this dream have I
<lb/>Well studied: mark the marvel of its meaning.
<lb/>From this day forth for forty years and more
<lb/>Among the Arabs one will rise to power,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1790"/>
<lb/>Who will adopt the way of righteousness,
<lb/>And turn aside from all deceit and loss.
<lb/>He will confound the whole Faith of Zarduhsht.
<lb/>When he shall show the moon his finger-tip,
<lb/>His finger will divide it into two,
<lb/>And none will look upon his back in toil.
<lb/>The Jew and Christian shall withstand him not,
<lb/>And he will do away with former Faiths.
<lb/>He will ascend a triple-footed throne,
<lb/>And all the world will be advised by him.
<lb/>When he shall quit this Wayside Hostelry
<lb/>The treasure of his words will still remain.
<lb/>The world will joy in him from age to age,
<lb/>Save the Shah’s palace which the winds will scatter.
<lb/>When he is dead a scion of thy race
<lb/>Will have the tymbals, drums, and elephants.
<lb/>A host will come on him from the Hijaz,
<lb/>Though unpossessed of arms and equipage,
<lb/>Will cast him from the throne upon the dust,
<lb/>And fill the world with warriors. Then will cease

<pb n="68"/>

<p>
<lb/>The observation of the feast of Sada,
<lb/>And every Fire-fane be a rubbish heap,
<lb/>Folk will no longer worship Fire and Sun,
<lb/>And all the fortunes of the brave will slumber.
<lb/>Jamasp himself declared before Gushtasp
<lb/>This secret, giving this interpretation.”
<lb/>When Nushirwan heard this from Buzurjmihr
<lb/>The favour of his countenance was changed;
<lb/>He was all day the mate of pain and grief,
<lb/>And slumbered, when night came, worn out by care.<note>Or, with the change of a diacritical point:— <l>And when the night came, could not sleep for care.</l></note>
<lb/>Now when three watches of the night had passed
<lb/>There went up such a panic-stricken cry
<lb/>That thou hadst said: “‘The world is all o’erturned!”
<lb/>And then one said: “The hall is rent in twain!”
<lb/>Thereat the Shah’s heart started from its place,
<lb/>And in the uttermost bewilderment
<lb/>He spake concerning it to Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Beginning with the rending of the hall,
<lb/>Which when the sage had looked upon he spake
<lb/>On this wise, saying: ‘O Shah Nushirwan!
<lb/>This outcry rose by reason of the Sun
<lb/>That thou beheldest in thy dreams last night.
<lb/>Know that thy palace gave a cry what time
<lb/>That moon-like babe was born, and presently
<lb/>A horseman with two steeds will come to say:—
<lb/>‘Fire-worship is abandoned to the blast!’”
<lb/>Thereat, as swiftly as the flying dust,
<lb/>A horseman came with tidings: “Even now
<lb/>Azargashasp is cold!”
<lb/>The Shah’s heart straitened
<lb/>Because of it; he sighed continually.
<lb/>Then Buzurjmihr: “O Shah! why mourn therefor?
</p>

<pb n="69"/>

<p>
<lb/>What matter this world’s griefs and joys to thee
<lb/>When thou art gone and parted far by time?”
<lb/>The Shah survived not this event for long.
<lb/>He died: the world bewailed him. Buzurjmihr
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1791"/>
<lb/>Veiled his own visage in the dust within
<lb/>Four se’nnights of the passing of the Shah,
<lb/>Who left behind this record when he went.

<head>XLII. HURMUZD, THE SON OF NUSHIRWAN: HE REIGNED TWELVE<note n="1">Fourteen according to P.</note> YEARS</head>

<div>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Hurmuzd, on succeeding to the throne, makes fair promises but soon belies them and puts to death his father’s ministers. Afterwards, perturbed by a prophecy, he repents, and two stories are told of his even-handed justice.
War breaks out and Bahram Chubina comes upon the scene.
He is appointed commander-in-chief and defeats the Turks under King Sawa and his son Parmuda, but after having been shamefully insulted by the Shah he rebels—a course strongly opposed by his sister Gurda. He contrives to make Hurmuzd suspicious of his own son Khusrau Parviz who escapes. Hurmuzd is dethroned and blinded, and
Khusrau Parviz returns.</p>
</div>

<head>NOTE</head>

<div>
<p>Hurmuzd (Hormisdas IV., A.D. 578-590) may not have been so black as he has been painted but his reign, to say the least of it, stands in melancholy contrast to that of his father whose precepts he disregarded, whose system of administration he did his best to overturn, whose trusted ministers he put to death, and whose practice of personally leading his troops he made no attempt to emulate.<note n="2">RSM, p. 473.</note> He had the good fortune to possess a general at once brave, able, and apparently quite loyal whom he treated with the basest and most insolent ingratitude, wrecking his own

<pb n="71"/> reign thereby and inflicting many wounds upon his country.
The romantic history of that general, as told in the Shahnama, is one of the finest passages in the poem, and the poet was fortunate in having such to lay before his readers as he was nearing the end of his great undertaking.<note n="3">See p. 96 seq.</note></p>

<p>Makh, the marchlord of Hardt, who seems to have been known as Khurdasani in accordance to Persian custom in such matters, appears to be the father of, or identical with, one of the four compilers of the prose Shahnama for
Abi Mansur which Firdausi used as his chief authority.
In the Introduction to the present Translation the name of this particular compiler is given, in accordance to the text of C., as Taj son of Khuradsani of Harat<note n="4">Vol. i. p. 67.</note> but according to Noldeke<note n="5">NIN, pp. 14 note 15.</note> the Taj is quite uncertain.</p>

<p>Nushirwan had based his system of administration upon the nobility. We have seen in a characteristic anecdote how he refused to consult his own convenience by accepting a loan of money from a shoemaker.<note n="6">p. 48.</note> Hurmuzd, not having his father’s ability, found the system irksome and consequently was inclined to favour the lower at the expense of the higher orders. Accordingly, later on we have two stories of his even-handed justice.<note n="7">p. 91.</note> A justice, however, which is said to have put to death 13,600 of the nobility and priesthood, and imprisoned or degraded many others in the course of a few years is somewhat suspect.<note n="8">NT, p. 267.</note></p>

<p>Buzurjmihr seems to be identical with Buzurjmihr who, we were told at the end of the last reign,<note n="9">p. 69.</note> died within a month of Nushirwan. According to Masudi Buzurjmihr survived to be the chief minister of Khusrau Parviz who after thirteen years of reign disgraced him and treated him even worse than Nushirwan is said to have done on one occasion,<note n="10">p. 4 seq., MM, ii. 224.</note> the two accounts no doubt being variants of the same story.
Firdausi tells us that one of the three scribes was young,<note n="11">p. 81.</note> and that Buzurjmihr was a youth at his lessons when he first attracted Nushirwan’s attention,<note n="12">Vol. vii. p. 283. Cf. p. 313.</note> He need not have been an old man at the time of that Shah’s death. The probability is, however, that he was executed along with other ministers by Hurmuzd as the text seems to imply.</p>

<pb n="72"/>


<p>The account in the Shahnama and in Oriental historians of these wars seems much exaggerated. The war with Rum was nothing new: it had been going on from the days of Nushirwan and was not specially active at the moment. The Arab and Khazar invasions require further confirmation and the latter, it may be suggested, was merely a patriotic invention to cover up an unfortunate incident that befell the Persians South of the Caucasus after the conclusion of the war with the Turks (p. 76). This last war has generally been taken to have been waged between the
Persians and the Khan who was a relation by marriage of
Hurmuzd and would be certain to bring great forces into the field. It appears, however, that Sawa is merely the
Persian form of “Chao-wou”—the name given in Chinese official reports of the period to the princes of small states on the Oxus that were more or less subject to the Khan who does not appear to have been concerned in the matter at all.<note n="13">NT, p. 269 and notes. RSM, p. 467.</note></p>

<p>In the story of Mihran Sitad’s embassy as given in the Shahnama the prophecy is limited to the outcome of the marriage of Nushirwan with the Khan‘s daughter.<note n="14">Vol. vii. p. 354.</note>
It afforded, however, a convenient starting-point for the
Romance that gathered round the heroic personality of
Bahram Chubina and the reference to him was interpolated accordingly.</p>

<p>Bahram Chubina, whose story and that of his sister
Gurdya extend through the rest of this and far into the succeeding reign, had been marchlord of Rai and governor of the North, apparently, under Nushirwan.<note n="15">ZT, ii. 252. Cf. Vol. vii. p. 214.</note> He continued to hold the same posts under Hurmuzd.<note n="16">ZT, ii. 253.</note> He was a native of Rai, sprung from a race of marchlords and armychiefs, a Mihran, and is said to have been descended from
Gurgin<note n="17">ZT, ii. 252.</note>—all important indications to the student of the
Shahnama. Rai was the traditional seat of Arsacid power.<note n="18">Vol. vi. pp. 201, 215, 223.</note> Shapur of Rai, an army-chief, who was called in by Kubad to overthrow Sifarai of the race of Kawa, also was a Mihran and descended from Mihrak.<note n="19">Vol. vii. pp. 185, 192.</note> The Mihran clan played an important part in Sasanian times and the name often recurs.<note n="20">Id.</note>
Gurgin, son of Milad, was the villain of the story of Bizhan and Manizha.<note n="21">Vol. iii. p. 289 seq.</note> The point is this. The words Milad, Mihrak, and Mihran are closely allied, probably mere variants, are reminiscent of Parthian times and under the Sasanian Dynasty represent the vanquished Arsacid element.<note n="22">Vol. iii. p. 11. vi. 256, vii. 156.</note> That element recovered sufficiently to exercise much political power as in the case of the Mihrans.</p>

<pb n="73"/>

<p>A Ruhham of that stock is said to have been influential in placing Piruz upon the throne.<note n="1">Vol. vii. p. 156.</note> If they could not be kings themselves, they aspired to be king-makers and ministers. There was rivalry between them and families of purer Iranian stock, and the Shahs, as in the instance given above, availed themselves of it to serve their own ends. Such rivalry, however, was a subsidiary matter; the great antagonism between Arsacid and Sasanian, though latent, still persisted and is indicated plainly enough in the course of the story of Bahram Chubina.</p>

<p>Noldeke’s account of that story, which is a blend of history and romance, is briefly as follows. It was compiled in Pahlavi shortly before the end of the Sasanian Dynasty, about the beginning of the reign of Yazdagird III., A.D. 632, and was translated into Arabic by a certain Jabala bin Salim of whom nothing more is known save that he was "the writer of Hisham” who can be no other than the Arabic historian Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi. Hisham died about A.D. 820. The story thus became known to the Muhammadans and was woven into the general presentment of Sasanian history.<note n="2">NT, p. 474.</note> We may add that Tabari, who was born some eighteen years after Hisham’s death and died A.D. 923, gives the historical nucleus of the story in his history. The redactor of his work into Persian (A.D. 963) states that as his Arabic authority has not given the life of Bahram Chubina in its entirety he gives it from the book of the history of Persia where he found it more complete.<note n="3">ZT, ii. 253.</note> This version agrees very closely with Firdausi’s. Both are derived from the Persian Book of Kings in one or another of its later forms. Which the redactor of Tabari used we cannot say, but Firdausi, we may assume, used the modern Persian prose Shahnama of Abd Mansur<note n="4">See Vol. i. p. 67.</note> for which a new translation of the story had been made from the original Pahlavi.<note n="5">NT, p. 475.</note> This may account for the difference in some of the proper names that exists between Firdausi’s version and that in the Persian Tabari. In this and some other respects the latter is of decided help to the understanding of the former. Attention will be called to such matters in subsequent notes.</p>

<p>It is evident that the redactors of the Pahlavi original into Arabic or Persian took good care to leave little repugnant to Muhammadan Faith or morals. Even the statement in Tabari and its Persian version that Gurdya was the wife as well as the sister of Bahram Chubina<note n="6">NT, p. 279. ZT, ii. 303.</note> disappears in Firdausi.</p>

<p>Yalan-sina—a prominent character in the Romance—is called Mardanshah in the Persian Tabari. He was the brother<note n="7">NT, p. 478.</note> and a firm supporter of Bahram Chubina. Another brother—Gurdwi—took the opposite side and remained loyal to Khusrau Parviz. The sympathies of Gurdya, Bahram Chubina‘s sister, though she associated with him till his death, were also legitimist.</p>

<p>Here we have another instance of a Mihran in high office.<note n="8">Cf. p. 72.</note> Probably he was the successor of Izad Gashasp, the scribe, who had been put to death by Hurmuzd early in his reign<note n="9">p. 83.</note> and is to be carefully distinguished from the general of the same name in Bahram Chubina’s army, which is not always done in the text of C.<note n="10">Cf. pp. 75, 150 note, 158 note.</note></p>

<p>In the Persian Tabari, the purveyor of sheep's heads is said to have been naked and Bahram Chubina to have speared two of the heads, one of which fell back into the tray. The interpretation was that he would have to deal with two kings of whom one would be killed while the other would be restored to his royalty. The nudity signified that Bahram Chubina would revolt.<note n="11">ZT, ii. 258.</note></p>

<p>According to the Persian Tabari, Hurmuzd, on hearing of the invasion of Sawa Shah, sent Kharad, son of Barzin, with an escort to him to delay his advance while the expedition under the command of Bahram Chubina was being got ready. The envoy managed to keep Sawa at Balkh for a whole year.<note n="12">ZT, ii. 259.</note></p>

<pb n="74"/>
<p>Faghfur, or Faghfur of Chin, hitherto in the Shahnama a <pb n="75"/> dynastic title, here appears as the name of the younger son of Sawa perhaps to add to the latter's importance. In the Persian Tabari the governor of Khurasan takes the part here played by Faghfur.<note n="1">ZT, ii. 259.</note></p>

<p>In the Persian Tabari, Bahram Chubina has the dream while dozing on horseback after having been engaged in arraying the troops all night, and in the same authority bars the road of retreat with five hundred horse,<note n="2">ZT, ii. 261.</note> while the only sorcery is in connection with the dream.</p>

<p>According to Tabari<note n="3">NT, p. 271.</note> the shot that slew king Sawa was one of three that gave renown to archers in Persian story. The others were that of Arish<note n="4">See Vol. v. p. 12.</note> and that of Sufaraf who in the war undertaken to avenge Piruz shot at a chief in the vanguard of Khushnawaz and pierced his horse’s head with an arrow. The chief was taken prisoner by Sutfarat who sent him back to Khushnawaz with instructions to report the matter, and Khushnawaz was so impressed that he sued for peace.<note n="5">NT, p. 127. ZT, ii. 143.</note> Neither of these instances is mentioned in the Shahnama though it celebrates in a famous passage Rustam’s shot in the fight with Ashkabus<note n="6">Vol. iii. pp. 109, 181.</note>, and Bahram Gur’s skill in archery.<note n="7">Vol. vi. p. 383, Vol. vii. pp. 54, 55, 80.</note></p>

<p>Bahram, the son of Sivawush, had married a niece of Bahram Chubina.<note n="8">ZT, ii. 262. Cf. NT, pp. 281, 282 note.</note></p>

<p>The episode of the garden is not in the Persian Tabari.</p>

<p>The above remark applies to the quarrel between Bahram Chubina and Parmida, and to the former’s retention of some of the booty.</p>

<p>The Persian Tabari makes Mardanshah (Yalan-sina), not Izid Gashasp, conduct the Khan, the other prisoners, and the booty to Iran.<note n="9">ZT, ii. pp. 265, 266.</note></p>

<p>The Shahnama here seems to confuse Izid Gashasp with the scribe of that name executed by Hurmuzd.<note n="10">p. 83.</note> It is clear from the Persian Tabari that the person consulted by the Shah about Bahram Chubina was his confidant and minister Ayin Gashasp who in the Persian Tabari<note n="11">ZT, ii. p. 266.</note> is named Yazdanbakhsh. Izid and Yazdan both mean God which also caused confusion and when it became hopeless the form Ayin Gashasp was adopted to get out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The definite accusation of withholding some of the booty made by the archscribe (Mihran) against Bahram Chubina is absent in the Persian Tabari which merely gives the vague insinuation of the minister Yazdanbakhsh which rouses suspicion in Hurmuzd’s mind and causes him to send Mardanshah back to the commander-in-chief with a chain, distaff-case, and cotton, and an insulting letter.<note n="12">ZT, ii. p. 266.</note> A similar insult is recorded to have been offered by the Empress Sophia to the exarch Narses when he was superseded and bidden return to his place among the maidens of the palace where a distaff should again be placed in his hand.<note n="13">GDF, v. 336.</note></p>

<p>The treatment of Bahram Chubina by Hurmuzd, though foolish enough in any circumstances, was not quite so unreasonable and motiveless as it appears to be in the accounts of oriental writers. In A.D. 589 after the successful conclusion of Bahram Chubina’s expedition Hurmuzd conceived the idea of renewing the Lazic war which his father had abandoned in A.D. 562,<note n="14">Vol vii, p. 215.</note> and sent Bahram Chubina to conduct the campaign. That chief, however, was defeated by the Romans in a battle on the Araxes and his disgrace followed.<note n="15">NT, p. 272 note. RSM, p. 469.</note></p>

<p>Here for once the Shahnama seems to join hands with Western Romance. The Adventure, mutatis mutandis, reads as if it had been taken bodily from some medieval romance of chivalry.</p>

<p>According to the Persian Tabari, both Kharad, son of Barzin, and the archscribe were present on the occasion.<note n="1">ZT, ii. 267.</note></p>

<p>Here again there seems to be some confusion in connection with Izid Gashasp. He is identified with the archscribe in the heading. Moreover, he is pursued, captured, and brought back to Bahram Chubina, who lets him off very easily, because he is wanted for service with that paladin. In the Persian Tabari, both the fugitives make good their escape to Hurmuzd.<note n="2">ZT, ii. 268.</note> That version does not know of Izid Gashasp, who is mentioned, however, in Tabari.<note n="3">NT, p. 278.</note></p>

<p>In the Persian Tabari, Bahram Chubina sends Hurmuzd twelve thousand hangers with bent points to represent all his twelve thousand troops.<note n="4">ZT, ii. 267.</note></p>

<p>Bahram Chubina is here described as the son of Gashasp. <pb n="77"/> Tabari makes him the son of Bahram-Gushnasp,<note n="5">NT, p. 270.</note> the Persian version of Bahram,<note n="6">ZT, ii. 252.</note> and Mas'udi of the nickname—Chubin.<note n="7">MM, ii. 213. Cf. p. 98 note.</note></p>

<p>Izid Gashasp is regarded as dealing with both sides because of the malicious speech that he is represented to have made about Bahram Chubina.<note n="8">p. 150 and note.</note></p>

<p>The debate is not in the Persian Tabari.</p>

<p>The letter to the Khan is not in the Persian Tabari.</p>

<p>Historically, Bahram Chubina issued coins in his own name but apparently not in that of Khusrau Parviz.<note n="9">RSM, p. 471 note.</note></p>

<p>The authorities differ as to whether Gustaham was imprisoned as well as Bandwi. The Oriental say both, the Greek Bandwi only,<note n="10">RSM, p. 471 note.</note> which makes the revolt more intelligible.</p>

The Prelude</head>
<p>
<lb/>The Summer<note n="1">Tamuz, the Syrian month of July, in the original.</note> mocked the ruddy apple-tree,
<lb/>And treated fruit and leaf with raillery:—
<lb/>“As for the posy that in Spring of late
<lb/>Thou barest on thy breast intoxicate,
<lb/>With just a blush remembered in its bloom,
<lb/>And branches yielding exquisite perfume,
<lb/>How didst thou find a purchaser to buy,
<lb/>And do thy marketing so readily?
<lb/>Those emeralds and rubies who bestowed
<lb/>On thee that bendest underneath the load?
<lb/>Sooth! thou hast bartered blossom for the grace
<lb/>Of colour wherewithal to deck thy face,<note n="2">Three couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>But brought me to despair who cannot see
<lb/>Thy blossoms for thy flaunting bravery.”
<lb/>Sweet Spring, my charmer! whither hast thou fled,

<pb n="78"/>

<lb/>And left the glories of the garden dead?
<lb/>Howbeit Autumn hath a scent of thine,
<lb/>And I will drink to thee in new-made wine;
<lb/>Though thou art sallow I will praise thee yet,
<lb/>And deck thee like Hurmuzd’s own coronet,

How Hurmuzd ascended the Throne and harangued the Chiefs</head>
<p>
<lb/>A marchlord of Harat, well shot in age,
<lb/>There was, in all approven and beseen,
<lb/>A ready speaker, Makh by name, world-sage,
<lb/>Still flourishing and of exalted mien;
<lb/>And it was him I questioned fain to find
<lb/>What record of Hurmuzd he had in mind
<lb/>When that Shah filled the throne of equity:
<lb/>That eld of Khurasan thus answered me:—
<lb/>Whenas that Shah sat on the famous state
<lb/>He first gave praises to almighty God,
<lb/>The Arbiter of fortune, and then said:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1702"/>
<lb/>“We will renown the throne and hold in honour
<lb/>The men of high degree. We will enfold
<lb/>The world beneath our wings, as did our sire,
<lb/>In goodly case and Glory. We will make
<lb/>Offenders quake and ease the oppressed, be patient
<lb/>If one doth ill and succour him in trouble.
<lb/>The prop of majesty is clemency
<lb/>With bounty, justice, and right conduct. Know
<lb/>That good and evil never are concealed

<pb n="79"/>

<lb/>From Him who is the Maker of the world.
<lb/>
<lb/>Our ancestors—crown-wearers in their time,
<lb/>Which through their justice had its share of praise—
<lb/>Sought but for mildness, equity, and greatness,
<lb/>With valour, aptitude, their lieges’ service,
<lb/>
<lb/>Their lords’ observance, and to vex their foes.
<lb/>
<lb/>In every clime to act and to command,
<lb/>
<lb/>Power, counsel, and authority to treat,
<lb/>Are mine. The good affect a heaven-sent Shah.
<lb/>Now mercy is the capital of such;
<lb/>
<lb/>The age becometh full of ease through bounty.
<lb/>The mendicants will I entreat with kindness,
<lb/>
<lb/>And will watch o’er the rich. The self-made man
<lb/>Shall have a prosperous commerce with ourselves.
<lb/>Withhold not your desires from my fond heart;
<lb/>
<lb/>I will abate with ease whatever cause
<lb/>For fear ye entertain. Ye prosperous!
<lb/>
<lb/>Joy in my crown and throne. Amid the great
<lb/>Mine is the lustre in that mercy, justice,
<lb/>
<lb/>And bounty are mine own. Grow still in kindness,
<lb/>And banish greed and vengeance from your hearts.
<lb/>They that fear God will see not evil fortune,
<lb/>
<lb/>So strive ye all, both small and great, to win
<lb/>The favour of the Maker of the world.
<lb/>
<lb/>Again, let not the heart of one possessed
<lb/>Of wisdom contemplate ingratitude,
<lb/>
<lb/>And when thou benefitest other folk
<lb/>Let there be no idea of recompense.
<lb/>
<lb/>Mix not with men that speak deceitfully,
<lb/>For what they utter is for outward show,
<lb/>
<lb/>And if thy king be just think thou no shame
<lb/>Concerning him, for while thou callest him
<lb/>Unwise he may be studious of the words
<lb/>Of former Shahs,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> and when his heart is prompted
<lb/>To mercy sow not thou the seed of guile

<pb n="80"/>

<lb/>Upon the earth. The spurner of our counsel
<lb/>Will throw away the benefits of fortune.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1793"/>
<lb/>The approval of thy Shah sufficeth thee,
<lb/>While to resist him is the road to ruin.
<lb/>His harshness in exhorting thee is kind,
<lb/>For he would break with thee if he were wroth.
<lb/>Begrudge no efforts in the cause of good,
<lb/>And joy not in injustice and in wealth.
<lb/>When in the world thou hast thy heart’s desire,
<lb/>And reached what thou wast instant to attain,
<lb/>Still, when thou don’st the crown of seventy years,
<lb/>Thou yieldest all thy winnings to the foe.
<lb/>My heart is greatly troubled for the poor,
<lb/>And I would have them ever in my thoughts.
<lb/>I ask the holy Fosterer for time
<lb/>To render poor folk happy with my treasures;
<lb/>I will not bring the saintly heart to trouble.
<lb/>If any by his monetary wealth
<lb/>Shall grow too kinglike him will I abase:
<lb/>No rival will I have. From first to last,
<lb/>In public utterance and secret thought,
<lb/>We are the same. The Maker’s benison
<lb/>Be yours, your earth the circling vault of heaven.”
<lb/>Now when the assembly heard his words each man
<lb/>Grew thoughtful, those of wealth were filled with fear,
<lb/>And tyrants’ hearts were rent, while for their part
<lb/>The sage and mendicant waxed glad of heart.

<div><head>§ 3
How Hurmuzd slew Izid Gashasp, Zarduhsht,
Simadh Barzin and Bahram Azarmidokht, his
Father's Ministers<note n="1">The heading in the original seems to have been carelessly compiled. The one above has been adopted to suit the account in the text.</note></head>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah ruled well until he felt secure
<lb/>And had attained his ends but then he raged,
<lb/>Displayed his evil nature, left the path
<lb/>Of right and, as he had determined, slew
<lb/>Those most in honour with his father—men,
<lb/>Who, innocent and happy, feared no ill.
<lb/>
<lb/>Among the scribes of Nushirwan were three,
<lb/>Two old, one young, their names Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>Burzmihr—a learnéd scribe of Grace and presence—
<lb/>And Mah Azar, wise, shrewd, and prosperous.
<lb/>The three had been vizirs and ministers
<lb/>Before the throne of Nushirwan. Hurmuzd
<lb/>Was longing to bring ruin on all three
<milestone unit="calced" n="1794"/>
<lb/>Because he feared that they might prove ingrate.
<lb/>Without a cause he raised his hand against
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, bound and imprisoned him.
<lb/>
<lb/>The high priest’s heart was straitened and his cheek
<lb/>Wan with anxiety, for he was good,
<lb/>An ancient named Zarduhsht, and at the bondage
<lb/>Of scribe Izid Gashasp it was as though
<lb/>His own heart had been arrow-pierced.

<pb n="82"/>

<lb/>Now when
<lb/>Izid Gashasp had passed a day untended,
<lb/>Without food, clothes or solacer, a friend
<lb/>Conveyed for him this message from the prison
<lb/>To the high priest: “O thou that to the captive
<lb/>Art skin and marrow! here am I within
<lb/>
<lb/>The prison of the Shah without attendance,
<lb/>And none can come to me. I crave for food;
<lb/>A famished paunch increaseth my distress.
<lb/>Send to me what is fit and, when I die,
<lb/>
<lb/>Some linen<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> and a stitcher for my shroud.”
<lb/>
<lb/>The high priest’s heart was grieved at his affliction,
<lb/>His message, place, and lodging. He replied:—
<lb/>“Complain not of the matter of thy bondage
<lb/>If thou art not in jeopardy of life.”
<lb/>
<lb/>Albeit the message left him broken-hearted,
<lb/>And troubled for himself. He thought: “If news
<lb/>Shall reach this Graceless and ungenerous Shah
<lb/>That his high priest hath sent things to the prison,
<lb/>My life and body are not worth a mite;
<lb/>
<lb/>This world-lord will destroy me and will turn
<lb/>A livid face toward me in his wrath.”
<lb/>Yet through affection for Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>The scribe, his heart was wrung, his face like gall.
<lb/>He bade his heedful cook take to the prison
<lb/>Food for the prisoner and afterwards
<lb/>Gat on an Arab steed and went to him.
<lb/>The keeper of the prison paled with fright,
<lb/>On seeing the high priest, but dared not say:—
<lb/>“Go not within the prison for this king
<lb/>Is self-willed and a novice.”
<lb/>Bathed in tears
<lb/>That agéd man alighted from his steed,
<lb/>And visited Izid Gashasp. They clasped
<lb/>Each other in a close embrace, all anguish,
<lb/>The lashes of their eyes like clouds in Spring,
<lb/>And held talk of the Shah’s malignity
<lb/>Until words failed them. Then the board was spread
<lb/>Before those holy men who next began

<pb n="83"/>

<lb/>To mutter prayers with sacred twigs in hand,
<lb/>And afterwards Izid Gashasp in whispers
<lb/>Conveyed his wishes, while the high priest hearkened,
<lb/>As to his hoarded treasure and dinars,
<lb/>His mansions, palaces, and property,
<lb/>And said: “O noble man! on going hence
<milestone unit="calced" n="1795"/>
<lb/>Say to Hurmuzd from me: 'Though thou mayst spurn
<lb/>My words yet think upon the toils and care
<lb/>That I supported with Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And how I cherished thee too on my breast.
<lb/>My recompense is chains and fear of worse,
<lb/>And I shall show God on the Judgment Day
<lb/>A guiltless heart aggrieved against the king.’ ”
<lb/>Now when the high priest had gone home a spy
<lb/>Departed hastily and told the news
<lb/>To Shah Hurmuzd whose heart conceived fell schemes.
<lb/>He did not spare Izid Gashasp but sent,
<lb/>And slew him in the prison, heard reports
<lb/>At large about the high priest, made no sign,
<lb/>And pondered how by fair means or by foul
<lb/>To slay him; then gave orders to the cook
<lb/>To mingle bane in secret with some dish,
<lb/>And when the high priest came at audience-time
<lb/>To pay his duty to the illustrious king,
<lb/>Hurmuzd said: “Tarry here to-day for I
<lb/>Have a new cook.”
<lb/>The high priest sat; they spread
<lb/>The board; he paled; he felt that ’twas his last,
<lb/>And so it proved. The cooks brought up the meats,
<lb/>And Shah Hurmuzd partook of all in turn,
<lb/>But when he had the poisoned dish brought in
<lb/>The high priest glanced thereat and looked again.
<lb/>There was an ill surmise in his pure heart:—

<pb n="84"/>

<lb/>"His remedy is poison in that dish!”
<lb/>
<lb/>Hurmuzd, on seeing this, said not a word,
<lb/>But stretched his hand out to that dish of bane,
<lb/>And, in accordance to the use of kings
<lb/>When paying servants honour and regard,
<lb/>Put his own noble fingers to the board,
<lb/>And, having taken marrow from the dish, said to the high priest: “O thou honest man!
<lb/>I made this luscious morsel for thyself,
<lb/>So open wide thy mouth and take this food,
<lb/>And such should be thy nourishment henceforth.”</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage answered: “By thy life and head,
<lb/>And may thy head and crown endure forever,
<lb/>Bid me not eat it; I have had enough,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>So do not press me further.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Hurmuzd:—
<lb/>“By sun and moon, and by the purity
<lb/>Of soul of him who is the Shah and world-lord,
<lb/>Thou shalt accept this morsel from my hand,
<lb/>And frustrate not my wish herein.”
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/>
<lb/>“The Shah hath bidden and I have no choice.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He ate, then left the board, in sore distress,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1796"/>
<lb/>And hurried home, spake of the poisoned food
<lb/>To none but spread a robe and lay lamenting.
<lb/>He ordered one to fetch an antidote
<lb/>From those old hoards of his or from the city,
<lb/>But it availed not aught, and bitterly
<lb/>Complained he unto God against Hurmuzd.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah dispatched a trusty man to learn
<lb/>The high priest’s state, the action of the poison,
<lb/>And if the scheme had failed. Now when the eye
<lb/>Of the high priest beheld the messenger
<lb/>Tears fell from his eyelashes down his cheeks.
</p>

<pb n="85"/>

<p>
<lb/>“Go, tell Hurmuzd,” he said: ‘Thy fortune changeth.
<lb/>Hereafter, through thy mischievous designs,
<lb/>Thou shalt be blind and shiftless in the world,
<lb/>Thy foes shall have their hearts’ desire upon thee,
<lb/>And lasting shame shall dog thy soul for this.
<lb/>Soon wilt thou die and leave an evil name.
<lb/>I go to lay my cause before the Judge,
<lb/>Where we shall face each other. Never more
<lb/>Sleep free from ill, for chastisement divine
<lb/>Confronteth thee. I take my leave of thee,
<lb/>Malignant man! Ill done will bring thee ill.’”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The trusty envoy heard and went with tears
<lb/>To take the king the message. He repented,
<lb/>Writhed at the high priest’s righteous words but saw
<lb/>No way to cure that smart and deeply sighed.
<lb/>Anon the high priest died, and all the wise
<lb/>Wept o’er him sorely. In this world of pain
<lb/>And toil why court renown and clutch at gain?
<lb/>The wise count breaths because no joys remain.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The high priest’s wretched end convulsed the realm
<lb/>With grief, but that blood-shedding, brutal worldlord
<lb/>Recked not of evil fortune, girt his loins
<lb/>For bloodshed, made Bahram Azarmihan
<lb/>His tool, called him by night and made him kneel
<lb/>Beside the throne, then said: "Thou wouldst feel safe
<lb/>From evil treatment at my hands? Then when
<lb/>The sun is bright in heaven, and mountain-tops
<lb/>Are shining like a back-plate, come among
<lb/>The nobles of Iran and take thy stand
<lb/>Before my throne. Then will I question thee
<lb/>About Simah Barzin: make answer boldly.
<lb/>I shall inquire: ‘What is this friend of thine,

<pb n="86"/>

<lb/>An evil man or one that serveth God?’
<milestone unit="calced" n="1797"/>
<lb/>Reply: ‘He is an evil man, a villain,
<lb/>And sprung from Ahriman.’ Then ask whatever
<lb/>Thou wilt—a handmaid, signet, throne, and crown.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: “I will, and multiply
<lb/>The ill a hundredfold.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah thus sought
<lb/>An artifice to put Simah Barzin,
<lb/>One of the chiefs, beloved by Nushirwan—
<lb/>That Lustre of the age—beyond the pale
<lb/>Of sympathy.
<lb/>Now when the Robe whose hue
<lb/>
<lb/>Is ivory-bright grew visible, and Sol
<lb/>Rose in the Sign of Gemini, the world-lord
<lb/>Sat on the ivory throne, and o’er his head
<lb/>They hung the costly crown. The Iranian chiefs
<lb/>Met and drew up in rank before the court-gate.
<lb/>The audience-chamberlain withdrew the curtain,
<lb/>And all the throng approached the king. First came
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan, Simah Barzin,
<lb/>And valiant chiefs. Each took his proper seat,
<lb/>The crowd still standing in the monarch’s presence,
<lb/>Who questioned thus Bahram Azarmihan:—
<lb/>“Now doth Simah Barzin, in presence here,
<lb/>Deserve our wealth or is he troublesome,
<lb/>Because the ill-disposed deserve not treasure?”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan well understood
<lb/>The question of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Its base and motive: “We must weep therefor,
<lb/>And from the ruler of the people I
<lb/>Shall have at last a charnel but no shroud!”
<lb/>And thus he made response: “O noble Shah!
<lb/>Look for no goodness from Simah Barzin,
<lb/>For he hath wrecked Iran. Would that his body
<lb/>Had neither brain nor skin! He speaketh naught
<lb/>But villainy and thus produceth strife.”
</p>

<pb n="87"/>

<p>
<lb/>Simah Barzin, on hearing this, replied:—
<lb/>“My good old friend! defame not thus my person,
<lb/>And be not thus confederate with the Div.
<lb/>Since thou hast been my friend what words and deeds
<lb/>Of Ahriman hast thou perceived in me?”
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan thus answered him:—
<lb/>“Thou hast been scattering seed throughout the world,
<lb/>And thou wilt be the first to reap the crop.
<lb/>Black smoke shall be thy portion of the fire,
<lb/>For Nushirwan once summoned thee and me,
<lb/>And made us kneel before the royal throne
<lb/>With the high priest, Burzmihr, and with that chief
<lb/>Of comely face, Izid Gashasp, and asked:—
<lb/>‘Who doth deserve the imperial throne and who
<lb/>Possesseth Grace? On younger son or elder
<lb/>Shall I bestow it? Which is worthier
<lb/>Of kingship?’
<milestone unit="calced" n="1798"/>
<lb/>
<lb/>Then the rest of us arose,
<lb/>And framed our tongues to utter this reply:—
<lb/>‘This man of Turkman kindred is unworthy;
<lb/>None would give aught for such a Shah, for he
<lb/>Is Khan-descended, is of evil nature,
<lb/>And like his mother both in looks and bearing.’
<lb/>Thou saidst: ‘Hurmuzd is fit to be the Shah,’
<lb/>And now art guilty of the consequence.
<lb/>For this cause have I testified against thee,
<lb/>And opened thus my lips in thy dispraise.”
<lb/>Hurmuzd at that archmage’s truthful words
<lb/>Turned pale with shame. At night he sent them both
<lb/>To prison and for two nights made no sign
<lb/>Withal, but on the third, what time the moon
<lb/>Arose above the mountains, he dispatched
<lb/>Simah Barzin by slaying him within
</p>

<pb n="88"/>

<p>
<lb/>The prison of the thieves yet gat thereby
<lb/>But toil and malison. On hearing how
<lb/>That man of honest heart had passed away
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan sent to the Shah
<lb/>A message saying: “Thou whose crown is over
<lb/>The orbit of the moon! thou knowest how much
<lb/>I have endured to keep thy secrets close,
<lb/>And ne’er was aught but well disposed to thee
<lb/>Before thy father, that illustrious Shah.
<lb/>
<lb/>If thou wilt summon me and make me sit
<lb/>Beside the royal throne I will reveal
<lb/>A matter to thee in thine interest.
<lb/>Free me at once from bondage in the prison;
<lb/>’Twill help Iran and keep the wise unscathed.”
<lb/>
<lb/>Hurmuzd, when this came, chose a confidant
<lb/>To bring Bahram Azarmihan to him,
<lb/>And to that court renowned. The monarch summoned
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan when it was night,
<lb/>Caused him to kneel before the royal throne,
<lb/>And then said: “Tell me what this matter is
<lb/>That will secure my life in happiness.”
<lb/>
<lb/>He answered: “In the royal treasury
<lb/>I have observed a plain black cabinet.
<lb/>Deposited within it is a casket,
<lb/>And therein is a document in Persian.
<lb/>’Tis written on white silk: the Iranians’ hopes
<lb/>Are centred there. ’Twas written by thy sire,
<lb/>That Shah and world-lord, and thou shouldest see it.”
<lb/>
<lb/>Then to his treasurer, good at need, Hurmuzd
<lb/>Sent one to say: “Seek in the ancient hoards
<lb/>A plain sealed cabinet and on the seal
<lb/>The name of Nushirwan, and may his soul
<lb/>Be ever young! Dispatch and bring it me
<lb/>Ere night be past.”
</p>
<pb n="89"/>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1799"/>
<p>
<lb/>The treasurer was prompt,
<lb/>And brought it with the seal intact. The world-lord
<lb/>Oped it, invoking oftentimes the while
<lb/>The name of Nushirwan. He saw within
<lb/>A casket, which was also sealed, wherefrom
<lb/>He eagerly took forth the piece of silk,
<lb/>And saw the characters of Nushirwan
<lb/>Inscribed thereon, and thus the writing ran:
</p>

<l>Hurmuzd for two years more than ten</l>
<l>Will prove a matchless monarch, then</l>
<l>The world will be convulsed, his name</l>

<l>Foes will spring up in every place</l>

</quote>

<p>
<lb/>On seeing that script, and in his father’s hand,
<lb/>Hurmuzd was frayed and rent the silk asunder.
<lb/>With bloodshot eyes and livid face he cried:—
<lb/>
<lb/>“Injurious man! what was thine aim herein?
<lb/>Wouldst have my head?”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan
<lb/>Said: “Turkman-born! how long wilt thou delight
<lb/>In bloodshed? From the Khan, not Kai Kubad,
<lb/>Art thou upon whose head the crown was set
<lb/>By Nushirwan.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hurmuzd knew: “If he can
<lb/>He will o’erthrow me,” heard out his abuse,
<lb/>And sent him back to prison where next night,

<pb n="90"/> 

<lb/>What time the moon rose o’er the mountain-tops,
<lb/>The deathsman slew him. At the court no sage
<lb/>Or counsellor or archimage was left.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>From ill self-governance all evils spring;
<lb/>See that thou disregard that evil thing.
</p>

</div>

<div><head>§ 4
How Hurmuzd turned from Tyranny to Justice</head>
<p>
<lb/>From that time forth he led a goodlier life,
<lb/>Moved by remorse at heart. Now every year,
<lb/>When nights were short, he sojourned at Istakhr
<lb/>Two months because that city was delightsome,
<lb/>The air serene: he knew not how to quit it.
<lb/>He and his court were wont to spend three months
<lb/>At Ispahan with its delicious air—
<lb/>The seat of mighty men. In Winter-time
<lb/>He dwelt at Taisafun among the troops,
<lb/>The archimages and the counsellors;
<lb/>While in the Spring he was upon the plain
<lb/>Of the Arwand, and thus a while went by.
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1800"/>
<p>
<lb/>His heart was terror-stricken by that scroll,
<lb/>He spent three watches of the night in prayer,
<lb/>Shed no more blood thenceforth and did no wrong:
<lb/>His soul mused not of ill. Whene’er the Veil
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli was hidden, and when
<lb/>The topaz height appeared, a herald used
<lb/>Thus to proclaim: “Famed men of Grace and prudence!
<lb/>
<lb/>If tilth be trampled and the sower troubled
<lb/>By that mishap, or if a horse shall enter
<lb/>Crops, or if any one withal shall trespass
<lb/>On orchards, then the horse’s tail and ears
<lb/>Must be cut off and the thief's head be set

<lb/>Upon the stake.”<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>He had a son beloved,
<lb/>Just like the moon, whom he had named Parwiz,
<lb/>And sometimes called “Khusrau the well-content.”<note>The prince afterwards famous as Shah Khusrau Parwiz.</note>
<lb/>He never left his father’s side for long;
<lb/>The father never bloomed without the son.
<lb/>It chanced that the young steed of prince Parwiz
<lb/>Escaped from stall and followed by its groom
<lb/>Went to the growing crops whose owner came
<lb/>Lamenting to the groom and asked: “What man
<lb/>Must sorrow for this horse’s ears and tail?”
<lb/>The groom said: “’Tis the horse of prince
<lb/>Parwiz;
<lb/>What careth he for subjects?”
<lb/>Then the owner
<lb/>Went to the king and laid the case before him,
<lb/>Who said: “Haste, dock the horse’s tail and ears,
<lb/>Then have the damage to the crop assessed,
<lb/>And prince Khusrau shall recompense the man
<lb/>A hundredfold in money from his treasures
<lb/>Upon the field and in its owner’s presence.”
<lb/>Thereat the prince moved chiefs to plead for him
<lb/>Before the Shah that he would not have docked
<lb/>The black steed’s tail and ears, but in his wrath
<lb/>Against the steed the king paid no regard
<lb/>To all those men of world-experience;
<lb/>The groom through terror of the king made haste
<lb/>To dock the young steed of its ears and tail
<lb/>Upon that tilth betrampled; and Khusrau
<lb/>Paid the complainant what the Shah had bidden.

<lb/>Anon the king went hunting, and they all
<lb/>Had much good sport. A valiant warrior,
<lb/>Whose father was the captain of the host,
<lb/>Saw, as he went along, a vine well laden

<pb n="92"/>

<lb/>With unripe grapes and bade his servant haste
<lb/>To cut and take some bunches to his cook.
<lb/>The owner came and said: "Thou miscreant!
<lb/>Thou neither wast the tender of this vine,
<lb/>
<lb/>Nor boughtest it with treasure and dinars!
<lb/>Why hast thou spoiled the labour of another?
<lb/>I shall complain of thee before the Shah.”
<lb/>
<lb/>The valiant horseman, fearing what might chance,
<lb/>Undid his belt forthwith and then bestowed it,
<lb/>All costly and all golden with each link
<lb/>Inlaid with gems, upon the man who said
<lb/>On seeing it: “What wrong one must condone!
<lb/>Tell not the king. Thou hast no purchaser
<lb/>In me, so make it no affair of price;
<lb/>
<lb/>While as for thanks I lay on thee that word;
<lb/>Thou wouldst be lifeless if that just judge heard!”<note>Six couplets omitted.</note>

How Hosts gathered from all Sides against Hurmuzd, and how he took Counsel with his Wazirs</head>
<p>
<lb/>When he had reigned for ten years righteously
<lb/>The voice of foemen rose from every realm,
<lb/>King Sawa marched upon him from Harat
<lb/>With drums and treasure, elephants and troops.
<lb/>If thou wouldst take the number of that host
<lb/>Go count four hundred o’er a thousand times.
<lb/>There were twelve hundred elephants of war ;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: “ Earth hath no room for them.”
<lb/>The desert from Harat to the Marvrud<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Was thick as warp and woof with soldiery,
<pb n="93"/>
<lb/>And as he led them on to Marv the earth
<lb/>Was hidden by the dust-clouds of the host.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1802"/>
<lb/>King Sawa wrote a letter to Hurmuzd,
<lb/>And said: “Convoke thy powers from every side,
<lb/>Repair the roads and bridges for my troops,
<lb/>Get provand and bethink thee of my sword.
<lb/>I would pass through thy realm. Mine army reacheth
<lb/>O’er river, height, and waste.”
<lb/>On reading this
<lb/>The king turned pale at all that countless host.
<lb/>Then from another quarter Caesar came,
<lb/>And over-ran the land with his array—
<lb/>A force of Rumans five score thousand strong,
<lb/>Courageous and redoubted cavaliers.
<lb/>The cities ta’en by Nushirwan, whose name
<lb/>Still frighted him, he took back with the sword :
<lb/>All were again obedient unto Caesar.<note>Couplet inserted from P. and one omitted.</note>
<lb/>A host came from the side of the Khazars,
<lb/>And all the fields and fells were black with them.
<lb/>A warrior of experience and possessed
<lb/>Of troops and treasure of his own was leader,
<lb/>And from Armenia their companies
<lb/>Extended to the gate of Ardabil.
<lb/>Then from the waste of spear-armed cavaliers
<lb/>An army came past count. “Abbas and ‘Amr,
<lb/>Two horsemen youthful and illustrious,
<lb/>Led them. They gave to havoc land and crop
<lb/>Because Hurmuzd demanded tribute of them.
<lb/>That host reached the Farat, and in that land
<lb/>No place for grass was left. When fortune loured
<lb/>News reached Hurmuzd, and that successful Shah
<lb/>Grew all amort at his informants’ words,
<lb/>And he repented slaying those archmages,
<lb/>And alienating wise men from his court.
<lb/>He saw no counsellor, and he had need
<pb n="94"/>
<lb/>Of wise advisers, so he sent and summoned
<lb/>The Iranians to full session in the palace,
<lb/>And made discovery of all the matter,
<lb/>Addressing thus those nobles of the land :—
<lb/>“ A greater host than any can recall
<lb/>Is marching on Iran.”
<lb/>Then all the marchlords
<lb/>Approached him with suggestions, saying thus :—
<lb/>“ Advised and prudent Shah! hear us herein.
<lb/>Thou art a wise Shah; we are subjects merely,
<lb/>And count ourselves as less than one archmage.
<lb/>Thy scribes and thine archmages hast thou slain,
<lb/>Departing from both faith and precedent.
<lb/>Think what to do and who shall guard our land.”
<lb/>Then said an archimage who was wazir :—
<lb/>“O sage and knowledge-seeking Shah! if now
<milestone unit="calced" n="1803"/>
<lb/>The host of the Khazars come forth to battle
<lb/>Our warriors will be fully occupied.<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">tes vaillantes troupes n’hésiteront pas un instant.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Let us make overtures to them of Rum,
<lb/>And then pluck up the Arabs by the root.
<lb/>King Sawa is more instant and with him
<lb/>Our prospect is more gloomy too. Our trouble
<lb/>Will come by way of Khurasan for he
<lb/>Will waste our country and our wealth withal ;
<lb/>So when the Turkman marcheth from Jihun
<lb/>To war there must be no delay.”
<lb/>Hurmuzd,
<lb/>For he was seeking for a policy,
<lb/>Said to that archimage: “‘ How shall we now
<lb/>Bear us toward king Sawa ?”
<lb/>He replied :—
<lb/>“Put thine own soldiers into war-array,
<lb/>For troops exalt a monarch. Summon too
<lb/>The muster-master that he may account
<lb/>The number fit for service.”
<pb n="95"/>
<lb/>With the roll
<lb/>The muster-master came before the Shah,
<lb/>Whose army numbered five score thousand men,
<lb/>The more part mounted, many were on foot.
<lb/>The archmage said: " With such a host as this
<lb/>We well may be defeated by king Sawa
<lb/>Unless thou actest boldly and uprightly,
<lb/>Dismissing all ideas of fraud and falsehood ;
<lb/>Then thou wilt free thy subjects’ heads from bonds
<lb/>As well becometh kingship. Thou hast heard
<lb/>The mighty tale of ill done to Gushtasp,
<lb/>And to Luhrasp all for religion’s sake
<lb/>By great Arjasp, that brave old Wolf, and all
<lb/>The cavaliers of Chin, the woe of Balkh,
<lb/>And how life was embittered in that land
<lb/>Until Asfandiyar was set at large,
<lb/>And pressed the war amain.<note>See Vol. v. p. 35 seq.</note> Unless the king
<lb/>Of earth will be advised he will behold
<lb/>Much trouble from the Turks of Chin, but though
<lb/>I pass the king in years I pass him not
<lb/>In thought.”
<lb/>The king said: “ Caesar shall not fight
<lb/>With us. I will restore the cities taken
<lb/>By Nushirwan, and then he will withdraw.”
<lb/>He chose a scribe—a warrior—as envoy,
<lb/>A wise, a prudent, and observant man,
<lb/>And sent him unto Caesar with this message :—
<lb/>“I want no Roman cities; be that land
<lb/>Thine ; but withal set foot not on our coasts
<lb/>If thou wouldst be both great and prosperous.”
<lb/>The envoy came to Caesar and delivered
<lb/>The message of Hurmuzd. The lord of Rum
<lb/>Withdrew and did no scath upon Iran.
<lb/>The king, when Caesar had withdrawn, prepared
<lb/>To war with the Khazars. He formed a host,
<pb n="96"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1804"/>
<lb/>Whose dust-clouds blotted day, and sent it thither
<lb/>To fire those fields and fells, led by Kharrad—
<lb/>A man of Grace, of worship, and of justice.
<lb/>Now when that army reached Armenia
<lb/>The host of the Khazars barred all the way.
<lb/>The Iranians slaughtered many and bare off
<lb/>Much spoil. The Arabs hearing this were checked,
<lb/>And went back whence they came. So when the Shah
<lb/>Heard that Kharrad had been victorious
<lb/>Naught but to fight king Sawa still remained,
<lb/>To which endeavour all his thoughts were strained.</p>
</div>

<div><head>§ 6
How Hurmuzd heard of Bahram Chubina and sent for him</head>
<p>
<lb/>A servant of the Shah’s, one hight Nastuh,
<lb/>A wise, successful, and observant man,
<lb/>Spake thus: “O Shah! be happy. May the hand
<lb/>Of ill be ever far from thee! My sire,
<lb/>The wise Mihran Sitad, hath still his wits,
<lb/>Though old, and sitteth with the Zandavasta
<lb/>In his retirement, having naught to hope for
<lb/>Through age and weakness. Now but recently
<lb/>I went and spent a day and night with him,
<lb/>Told him about king Sawa, his vast host,
<lb/>And elephants of war. My father said :—
<lb/>‘ The ancient prophecy is then fulfilled ! ’
<lb/>I questioned him: ‘ To what referrest thou ? ’
<lb/>He answered: ‘ If the Shah shall ask of me
<lb/>I will reveal it.’ ”
<lb/>Then the king of kings
<pb n="97"/>
<lb/>Commanded that a noble should set forth
<lb/>In haste and fetch the old man from his palace
<lb/>Upon a litter. When that ancient came,
<lb/>His heart all knowledge and his head all lore,
<lb/>Before the Shah, Hurmuzd inquired of him :—
<lb/>“What know’st thou of the past ? ”
<lb/>“O fluent Shah,
<lb/>And heedful,” said the elder, " when the Khan
<lb/>Dispatched thy mother to Iran from Chin
<lb/>I was the chief of eight score warriors
<lb/>That went to ask of him her hand in marriage.
<lb/>Thy father, that most upright king of kings,
<lb/>Demanded no slave’s daughter of the Khan,
<lb/>But said: * Require a daughter of the queen ;
<lb/>No slave must be the consort of the Shah.’
<milestone unit="calced" n="1805"/>
<lb/>I went before the Khan and did obeisance.
<lb/>He had five daughters in his women’s bower,
<lb/>All goodly, fit to deck the thrones of monarchs,
<lb/>In gait like pheasants and in looks like Spring,
<lb/>And all fulfilled with colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The monarch sent me to their bower. I entered
<lb/>That famed court. They had decked the daughters’ faces,
<lb/>And twined their locks with roses, save thy mother
<lb/>Who wore no coronet, no necklace, bracelet,
<lb/>Or other ornament but sat there mute
<lb/>With hanging head and shyly hid her face
<lb/>Behind her sleeves; but she alone of all
<lb/>Was daughter of the queen; none of the rest
<lb/>Possessed such elegance, such bloom, and charm
<lb/>Because the queen was daughter of Faghfur,
<lb/>And naturally indisposed to ill.
<lb/>She sorrowed that her child should dwell afar,
<lb/>And that pure daughter quit the monarch’s palace.
<lb/>Among those daughters her it was I chose ;
<lb/>I heeded not the others. Said the Khan :—
<pb n="98"/>
<lb/>‘Select another; all the five are fair
<lb/>And worshipful,’ and this was my response :—
<lb/>“My choice is made; to choose again were fatal.’
<lb/>Then summoned he his priests and made them kneel
<lb/>Before the royal throne and asked concerning
<lb/>His daughter’s future. Those astrologers
<lb/>Replied: ‘Thou shalt see naught but good and hear
<lb/>Naught but the truth. From her and from the Shah
<lb/>A prince like some fierce lion will be born,
<lb/>Of lofty stature and with lusty limbs,
<lb/>Brave as a lion, bounteous as a cloud,
<lb/>Black-eyed, impetuous, and choleric,
<lb/>Who, on his father’s death, will be the king.
<lb/>He will enjoy much treasure from his sire,
<lb/>And in his latter days refrain from evil.
<lb/>Thereafter will a mighty king arise,
<lb/>Lead forth a valiant host of Turks and seek
<lb/>With that array to occupy Iran
<lb/>And country of Yaman throughout. The Shah
<lb/>Will be in dudgeon at him and will fear
<lb/>His high, victorious fortune, but will have
<lb/>Far off a subject, an exalted horseman
<lb/>And loyal liege, tall and adust of body,
<lb/>Upon his head crisp locks as black as musk,
<lb/>Big both of bone and nose and swart of skin—
<lb/>A warrior brave and strong, nicknamed Chubina,<note>i.e., Stick-like.</note>
<lb/>And sprung from paladins. This strenuous man
<milestone unit="calced" n="1806"/>
<lb/>Will come with some few soldiers to the Shah,
<lb/>Soon overthrow this Turk and wreck his host.’
<lb/>Ne’er saw I one more glad than was the Khan
<lb/>On hearing this. He gave the Crown of all
<lb/>His daughters unto Nushirwan while I
<lb/>Received her on the Shah's behalf. This done
<pb n="99"/>
<lb/>I hied me home, the Khan producing for us
<lb/>Such wealth of jewels from his treasury
<lb/>That we were put to it to carry them.
<lb/>He came with me as far as the Jihun,
<lb/>Embarked his daughter and with doleful heart
<lb/>Turned back, at one with sorrow for his child.
<lb/>Now have I told my tale here in thy presence,
<lb/>O king of men! Seek for the man himself
<lb/>Within thy realm and bid thy couriers haste
<lb/>Because thy triumph lieth in his hands,
<lb/>But tell not friend or foe.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>E’en with the words
<lb/>He yielded up the ghost, and all the folk
<lb/>Bewailed him bitterly. The king of kings
<lb/>Was all astound and poured down tears of blood.
<lb/>"Mihran Sitad,” he told the Iranians,
<lb/>“Retained this story in his memory,
<lb/>And after having told it to us died,
<lb/>Committing his accepted soul to God,
<lb/>And God be thanked that this old man hath uttered
<lb/>Words of such import. Had I fetched him hither
<lb/>But one hour later he had died and I
<lb/>Had seen much grief. Our realm must now be searched
<lb/>For this man whether he be lord or liege.
<lb/>Seek indefatigably for this one
<lb/>Until ye find him.”
<lb/>An illustrious subject,
<lb/>The master of the horse, named Zaed Farrukh,
<lb/>Who sought in all the pleasure of the Shah,
<lb/>Went to him and thus spake: “The indications
<lb/>Detailed by that famed man before the lords
<lb/>Can only, otherwise we clutch but wind,
<lb/>Apply, methinketh, to Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Son of Gashasp, a noble, well skilled horseman
<lb/>To whom thou gavest Ardabil and Barda’
<pb n="100"/>
<lb/>Where he became marchlord with drums and troops.’
<lb/>The Shah dispatched a speedy cameleer
<lb/>To bid Bahram Chubina dally not
<lb/>Upon the way but come from Ardabil
<lb/>To court alone without the drums and host.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The messenger the joyful news conveyed,
<lb/>And told him what Mihran Sitad had said.

<div><head>§ 7
How Bahram Chubina came to Hurmuzd and was made Captain of the Host</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1807"/>
<p>
<lb/>Not calling any of his warriors
<lb/>That world-aspirant hurried off from Barda’,
<lb/>And when he came the Shah accorded audience.
<lb/>On seeing the visage of the king of kings
<lb/>The veteran much praised that noble one,
<lb/>Who at first sight grew favourably disposed,
<lb/>Perceived the marks named by Mihran Sitad
<lb/>In him, smiled and grew blithe of countenance,
<lb/>Received him well and lodged him splendidly.
<lb/>When sombre night flung off its musky veil,
<lb/>And Sol displayed its face, the marchlord came
<lb/>To court, and all the chiefs made way for him.
<lb/>The world-lord summoned him and made him sit
<lb/>Among the magnates, told him how Iran
<lb/>Was placed and what Mihran Sitad had said,
<lb/>Then asked about king Sawa, saying: ‘Shall I
<lb/>Make peace or send forth troops ? ”
<lb/>The warrior
<lb/>Replied: "We may not make a peace with him,
<lb/>For, since he fain would fight, to sue for peace
<pb n="101"/>
<lb/>Will mean defeat for us; the foe moreover
<lb/>Will be emboldened if he see thee weak.
<lb/>To proffer feast in war-time is to make
<lb/>Contention like submission.”
<lb/>Said Hurmuzd:—
<lb/>“What is the course then? Shall I seek delay,
<lb/>Or march to battle?”
<lb/>He made answer thus:—
<lb/>"It augureth well if<note>Reading with P.</note> foes behave unjustly.
<lb/>What said the noble counsellor? ‘No match
<lb/>For justice is injustice.’ Therefore seek
<lb/>To fight with this injurious enemy,
<lb/>For fire and water will not flow together;<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>But if thou actest otherwise herein
<lb/>The ancient sky will choose another Shah.
<lb/>If we put forth the might of our own arms,
<lb/>And what we have of prowess, holy God
<lb/>Will neither blame us nor shall we be shamed
<lb/>Before the heroes when the truth is sought.
<lb/>Shall we be weak enough to shun the combat
<lb/>While yet ten thousand of Iranians
<lb/>Remain unslain? What will malignants say
<lb/>To thee if thou flee foes without a fight?
<milestone unit="calced" n="1808"/>
<lb/>When I pour arrows down on them and make
<lb/>My bow as ’twere a cloud in Spring, and when
<lb/>A hundred thousand swords and iron maces
<lb/>Are brandished in the ranks of war, and yet
<lb/>We gain no glimpse of triumph but despair
<lb/>Of fortune in our hearts, then we will be
<lb/>Our foemen’s to command for we shall have
<lb/>No body, life or spirit, left to us;
<lb/>But let us struggle till we see if heaven
<lb/>Will bring us gain or loss.”
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>The Shah smiled and the court grew bright, and then
<pb n="102"/>
<lb/>The veterans left the presence with full hearts,
<lb/>And talking with Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/>“Henceforth if he shall speak with thee be modest,
<lb/>Because king Sawa hath such mighty powers
<lb/>That e’en to ants and gnats they bar the way!
<lb/>Who after what thou said’st before the Shah
<lb/>Will venture to be captain of the host?”
<lb/>He answered them: “Illustrious warriors!
<lb/>I will be captain by our great Shah’s leave.”
<lb/>Informants on the watch went to the world’s king,
<lb/>And told him of this speech and ten times more.
<lb/>The king of kings rejoiced thereat and ceased
<lb/>To fear those troops. He gave Bahram Chubina
<lb/>The chief command, exalting to the clouds
<lb/>His valiant head. All warriors that sought
<lb/>For glory hailed him captain of the host.
<lb/>He came before the king with girded loins,
<lb/>Equipped for war, and said: “By thy permission
<lb/>I will call o’er the roll and ascertain
<lb/>Who are the fighting-men and who are slack
<lb/>In quest of fame.”
<lb/>The Shah said: “Thou art leader
<lb/>Responsible for good and ill alike.”
<lb/>The chief went to the royal muster-ground,
<lb/>And bade the troops parade. He made his choice
<lb/>Of those that were the crown among the chiefs,
<lb/>And entered on the roll twelve thousand names
<lb/>Of mail-clad warriors on barded steeds.
<lb/>All those enrolled were forty years of age;
<lb/>The older and the younger were rejected.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina held the chief command
<lb/>As one renowned in war. He made one hight
<lb/>Yalan-sina—a man of vengeful breast—<note>Sina.</note>
<lb/>Chief of the warrior-chiefs to go before
<pb n="103"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1809"/>
<lb/>The ranks on battle-days, to wheel his steed,
<lb/>Proclaim his ancestry, and set on strife
<lb/>The warriors’ thoughts. One named Izid Gashasp,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Who drew not rein at fire, he bade to guard
<lb/>The baggage-train and dress the wings. He made
<lb/>Kanda Gashasp, who as he rode would grasp
<lb/>The tails of lions, leader of the rear.
<lb/>Then to the troops thus spake the paladin:—
<lb/>‘Ye ardent chiefs! if ye would have God’s help
<lb/>In lightening your dark task inflict not harm
<lb/>Or loss and never gird your loins for ill,
<lb/>And when at night the clarion-call ariseth
<lb/>Leap up and one and all so spur your steeds
<lb/>That in the dark more tumult may arise.
<lb/>Through strength derived from resting horse and man
<lb/>Will take no thought about the day of battle.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>When tidings reached the king of how the wise
<lb/>Bahram Chubina acted he rejoiced
<lb/>Both at the words and deeds; he oped his treasures,
<lb/>And paid the troops. He gave Bahram withal
<lb/>Arms from the magazines which he unlocked,
<lb/>Assembled in the city all the herds
<lb/>Of battle-steeds that were at large, and ordered
<lb/>The captain of the host to ask of him
<lb/>Whate’er was needful, saying: “Thou hast seen
<lb/>All sorts of warfare and hast heard what stores
<lb/>King Sawa, that illustrious man, possesseth
<lb/>Of treasure, arms, and troops, and how his Turks
<lb/>Set earth a-quaking on the day of battle.
<lb/>Now thou hast chosen out of all the host
<lb/>Twelve thousand men in mail on barded steeds!
<lb/>I know not how such numbers can avail
<lb/>Upon the day of fight, and thou hast chosen,
<lb/>Instead of youthful sworders, men of forty!”
<pb n="104"/>
<lb/>The chief replied: "Well-starred and courteous Shah!
<lb/>The saying of the mighty thou hast heard,
<lb/>Who ruled the world as Shahs in days of old:—
<lb/>‘When conquering fortune is assisting thee
<lb/>‘Tis well though little other aid there be,’
<lb/>And by this token I will prove it too
<lb/>If now the Shah, whose word is law, will hear:
<lb/>When Kai Kaus was in Hamavaran,
<lb/>In bonds with countless others, Rustam chose
<lb/>Twelve thousand fit and warlike cavaliers,
<lb/>And freed him, and no harm befell the chiefs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1810"/>
<lb/>Again, Gudarz, son of Kishwad, the head
<lb/>Of noble and illustrious men, employed
<lb/>Twelve thousand men in mail on barded steeds
<lb/>To execute revenge for Siyawush.
<lb/>Again, the glorious Asfandiyar
<lb/>Was leader of twelve thousand warriors
<lb/>Against Arjasp and by a stratagem
<lb/>Made dust fly out of host and hold alike.<note>In the accounts given in the poem of these instances the limitation to twelve thousand is recorded only in the case of Asfandiyar. Later on, Gudarz, Bahram Chubina’s sister, repeats the statement about Rustam. See p. 108.</note>
<lb/>When any host exceedeth this amount
<lb/>It is too large for dash and enterprise;
<lb/>The leader that conducteth countless troops
<lb/>To battle is discomfited in fight.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>As for thy saying: "Men of forty years
<lb/>Are not so eager for the fight as youths,
<lb/>The man of forty hath experience,
<lb/>And excellence in point of hardihood,
<lb/>Remembering the seal of bread and salt
<lb/>O’er which the heaven hath so oft revolved.
<lb/>In dread too of the voice of calumny,
<lb/>And loss of fame, he shirketh not the fight.
<lb/>Moreover wife and child and family
<pb n="105"/>
<lb/>Irk not the feelings of a veteran.
<lb/>A young man is deceived by outward show,
<lb/>And when he should have patience he is rash.
<lb/>He hath not wife or child or tilth; to him
<lb/>The worthy and the worthless seem alike.
<lb/>Since wisdom resteth on experience
<lb/>He seeth not the import of affairs.
<lb/>If he is conqueror in any fight
<lb/>He laugheth with delight and wasteth time;
<lb/>But if one chanceth to prevail against him
<lb/>His foes see nothing but his back.”
<lb/>On hearing,
<lb/>The king grew fresh as roses in the Spring,
<lb/>Then said: "Depart, put on thy mail, and go
<lb/>Forth from the palace to the riding-ground.”
<lb/>The general left the king, called for his girdle,
<lb/>Mail-coat, and Ruman helm, had his steed barded,
<lb/>And set the coiled up lasso in its straps.
<lb/>The world-lord with his arrows, clubs, and balls
<lb/>Went out upon the ground with his wazirs.
<lb/>The general approached with mace and mail
<lb/>And Ruman casque. The world-lord, seeing, blessed him.
<lb/>He kissed the ground and showed a liege’s prowess
<lb/>With mace, at polo, and in archery.
<lb/>The king then had the banner brought that bare
<lb/>A violet dragon for device, the banner
<lb/>That had been borne in fight in front of Rustam,<note>Cf. Vol. il. p. 154.</note>
<lb/>Grasped it immediately and, handling it
<lb/>With smiles, bestowed it on Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Invoking many a blessing on him, saying:—
<lb/>“My predecessors used to hail as chief
<milestone unit="calced" n="1811"/>
<lb/>Of all our race the man whose name was Rustam,
<lb/>The paladin, the conqueror of the world,
<lb/>Triumphant and of ardent soul. Thou holdest
<pb n="106"/>
<lb/>His flag. Mayst thou be conquering and loyal <note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Thou art a second Rustam to my thoughts
<lb/>In courage, prowess, and obedience.”
<lb/>The paladin saluted him and said:—
<lb/>“Be always conquering and bright of mind.”
<lb/>With peerless Rustam’s banner in his hand
<lb/>The general left the plain for his abode,
<lb/>And on their several ways the Shah’s troops went.
<lb/>The captain of the host was well content.

<p>
<lb/>When morning dawned upon the mountain-tops,
<lb/>And when the glittering Shield of Gold appeared,
<lb/>The chief came to the palace of the Shah,
<lb/>And prostrate in the presence of the troops
<lb/>Spake thus: “I was a man that had no claims,
<lb/>But by thy Grace became the age’s crown.
<lb/>I have to beg one favour of the king—
<lb/>That he will send with me a trusty man
<lb/>To make a note of those that fight and lay
<lb/>A hostile head beneath the dust and thus
<lb/>Achieve their end.”
<lb/>Hurmuzd replied: ‘Mihran,
<lb/>The old, is great, observant, eloquent,”
<lb/>Bade him accompany the chief and quit
<lb/>The palace for the combat. From the province
<lb/>Of Taisafun the army marched, their leader
<lb/>Bahram Chubina. ’Twas a prudent, brave,
<lb/>And dauntless host, and wary as a lion
<pb n="107"/>
<lb/>Was their commander. When he had departed
<lb/>The monarch of the world himself withdrew,
<lb/>Was privy with his archimage<note>Ayin Gashasp.</note> and said:—
<lb/>“Upon the day of fight this man will laugh
<lb/>For joy! What will result? Let us confer.”
<lb/>The archimage answered: "Mayst thou live for ever,
<lb/>For thou deservest everlasting life.
<lb/>This paladin possessed of such a mien
<lb/>And stature, ready speech and ardent soul,
<lb/>Must needs be happy and victorious,
<lb/>And cause a barren world to bring forth fruit;
<lb/>But yet I fear me that he will revolt
<lb/>At last against his sovereign and patron
<lb/>Because he talked with such audacity,
<lb/>And spake so like a lion to the Shah.”
<milestone unit="calced" n="1812"/>
<lb/>Hurmuzd made answer to him: "Mingle not
<lb/>Bane with the antidote, misdoubting one!
<lb/>If he shall prove victorious o’er king Sawa
<lb/>I ought to yield to him the crown and throne.
<lb/>May he be ever as now for he will make
<lb/>A glorious sovereign!”
<lb/>The archimage,
<lb/>On hearing what the Shah said, paled and bit
<lb/>His lips. The king himself moreover kept
<lb/>The thing in mind, and in a while selected
<lb/>A courtier as his confidant to learn
<lb/>How matters stood, and said: “Pursue in haste
<lb/>The paladin and tell what thou observest.”
<lb/>The agent followed swiftly, known to none.
<lb/>He was a guide, in omens skilled, and used
<lb/>To utter his prognostics to the Shah.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, quitting Taisafun,
<lb/>Led on the host himself. In front appeared,
<lb/>And far from him, one that purveyed sheep’s heads,
<pb n="108"/>
<lb/>Which rose above a clean draped wicker tray.
<lb/>The chieftain urged his horse and, strange to tell!
<lb/>Pierced one head with his spear, rode off with it
<lb/>Aloft, then flung it where he would and drew
<lb/>An omen from the matter, saying thus:—
<lb/>“Just so will I cut off king Sawa’s head,
<lb/>Will throw it in his army’s line of march,
<lb/>And shatter all his host.”
<lb/>The emissary,
<lb/>Sent by the Shah, drew too his presage, saying:—
<lb/>“This favourite of fortune will attain,
<lb/>His labours done, the crown at last for when
<lb/>His end is gained he will grow troublesome,
<lb/>And will rebel.”
<lb/>He went and told the king,
<lb/>Who wedded grief and anguish for the words
<lb/>Were worse than death to him. He withered up,
<lb/>That verdant leaf grew sere. He called to him
<lb/>A young man of the court and sent him off
<lb/>In all haste to the paladin and said:—
<lb/>“Depart and tell the captain of the host:—
<lb/>‘For this night tarry where thou art. At dawn
<lb/>Turn back and come to me for I would clear
<lb/>The court of strangers and advise thee further,
<lb/>For thoughts of profit have occurred to me.’”
<lb/>The messenger came to the paladin,
<lb/>And told what he had heard. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Made this reply: "Men do not, O wise Shah!
<lb/>Recall an army on the march; such action
<lb/>Would be ill-omened and would reinforce
<milestone unit="calced" n="1813"/>
<lb/>The foe. I will return when I have conquered,
<lb/>And then thy kingdom and thy diadem
<lb/>Shall shine.”
<lb/>The messenger returned and gave
<lb/>The warrior’s answer to the Shah and he
<lb/>Was satisfied. That envoy’s toil was vain.
<pb n="109"/>
<lb/>At dawn the captain of the host led on
<lb/>The troops and called God’s blessing down on them.
<lb/>He marched to Khuzistan: <note>This seems to imply that he started from Pars. Later on he says (p. 112) that he started from Baghdad, i.e., from the neighbourhood of Taisafun (Ctesiphon) where the troops were stationed (p. 90). Baghdad itself was not then in existence.</note> the troops harmed none.
<lb/>There came a woman with a sack of hay
<lb/>Among them and a horseman purchased it,
<lb/>Refused to pay her, and made off. She came
<lb/>Lamenting to Bahram Chubina, saying:—
<lb/>“I have some hay concealed. I brought a sack’s worth,
<lb/>And passed before thy troops. A cavalier,
<lb/>With iron helm, hath taken it from me
<lb/>While on the march!”
<lb/>Forthwith they sought the man,
<lb/>And haled him quickly to the general.
<lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina said to him:—
<lb/>“So thou didst think this fault a little one!”
<lb/>They smashed his head and hands and feet. The chief
<lb/>Had him dragged forth before the camp-enclosure,
<lb/>Then clave him through the middle with the sword,
<lb/>And filled the heart of the unjust with terror.
<lb/>Then from the camp-enclosure ’twas proclaimed:—
<lb/>“O ye illustrious men and of good will!
<lb/>The stealer of a stalk of hay shall find
<lb/>No intercessor. I will cleave his waist
<lb/>Asunder with the sword. Let all procure
<lb/>By payment what they need.”
<lb/>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Led on his host well ordered and they marched
<lb/>Toward Damaghan.
<lb/>The Shah was full of care
<pb n="110"/>
<lb/>At Sawa’s army, elephants, and treasures,<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>And spake thus to Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>One night at rise of moon: “Prepare to go
<lb/>To our opponent and be diligent,
<lb/>Not slumbering but speeding. Mark his troops
<lb/>As to their numbers and their quality,
<lb/>And who their leader and their warriors are.”
<lb/>He ordered that a letter of advice
<lb/>Should be indited to the hostile king,
<lb/>And countless royal presents sent therewith.
<lb/>He said thus to the messenger: “Proceed
<lb/>Toward Harat and if a host appear
<lb/>Know it for that of brave Bahram Chubina,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1814"/>
<lb/>And not another. Then approach and tell him
<lb/>What thou hast heard from me, thus saying: ‘I
<lb/>By good news and by blandishment will spread
<lb/>A fresh snare for the foe. Thy secret purpose
<lb/>Must be kept hidden. If he hear thy name
<lb/>And fame...! I will induce him to thy net,
<lb/>Employing fair and lengthy parleyings.’”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, prepared to start,
<lb/>Came as the Shah had bidden and delivered
<lb/>The message when he saw Bahram Chubina.
<lb/>He went thence to king Sawa, to the place
<lb/>Where were the elephants and troops and treasure,
<lb/>And, having audience, did him reverence,
<lb/>Delivering the message privily,
<lb/>And adding to it every argument
<lb/>To draw the army to Harat. When Sawa
<lb/>Arrived and camped upon the river-bank
<lb/>The outposts went forth, marked Bahram Chubina
<lb/>With all his troops and, seeing that stout host,
<lb/>Returned in all haste to king Sawa, saying:—
<lb/>“A force hath reached the desert of Harat,
<lb/>Commanded by a famous chief.”
<pb n="111"/>
<lb/>King Sawa,
<lb/>Concerned what course to take, called from the tent
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah and rated him:—
<lb/>“Didst not foresee, thou crafty Ahriman!
<lb/>A fall from thy high station? From the court
<lb/>Of that vile Shah thou camest to ensnare me,
<lb/>And leadest forth to war a Persian host,
<lb/>Encamping on the meadows of Harat!”
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, replied: “The force
<lb/>Confronting thine is small. Take not its coming
<lb/>In ill part; ’tis some marchlord passing by,
<lb/>Or some chief seeking shelter with the Shah,
<lb/>Or merchants who have brought an escort with them,
<lb/>To guard them on their way. Who would confront thee,
<lb/>Though mountains turn to seas, to seek revenge?
<lb/>I will send one to find out who or what
<lb/>This traveller is.”<note>This couplet inserted from P.</note>
<lb/>His words rejoiced king Sawa,
<lb/>Who said: “In truth that is the course to take.
<lb/>We will dispatch to learn if friend or foe
<lb/>They be.”
<lb/>Now as Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Withdrew to his own tent the night o’ertopped
<lb/>The mountains, and he got in readiness
<lb/>To flee the wrath to come. At dead of night
<lb/>The monarch bade Faghfur go with an escort
<milestone unit="calced" n="1815"/>
<lb/>Forth from his father to the paladin.
<lb/>That understanding youth went forth and reaching
<lb/>The Iranian host dispatched a cavalier
<lb/>To ask: “Who are these warriors and wherefore
<lb/>March they?”
<lb/>The horseman went like dust and cried:—
<lb/>“Who are your chiefs and leader, noble sirs!
<pb n="112"/>
<lb/>And champion in the combat, for Faghfur,
<lb/>Who is king Sawa’s heart and eyes, would see him
<lb/>Without attendance?”
<lb/>Came a warrior
<lb/>Forth from the troops and told Bahram Chubina
<lb/>What he had heard. The captain of the host
<lb/>Went from the tent-enclosure and his flag
<lb/>Was reared resplendent over him. Faghfur
<lb/>Of Chin, perceiving, hasted and made sweat
<lb/>His prancing steed, and questioned: "Whence art thou?
<lb/>Why haltest here? I hear that thou hast fled
<lb/>From Pars as one who being wronged shed blood.”
<lb/>Bahram Chubina answered: “God forbid
<lb/>That I should purpose vengeance on the Shah.
<lb/>I came forth from Baghdad with this array
<lb/>To fight by his command, for when the news
<lb/>About king Sawa and his host reached court
<lb/>He said to me: ‘Go forth and hold the road
<lb/>With arrows, maces, spears, and scimitars.’”
<lb/>On hearing this Faghfur sped back to tell
<lb/>His sire how matters stood. Being thus apprised,
<lb/>And grown suspicious, Sawa sought forthwith
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah but someone said:—
<lb/>“Kharrad, son of Barzin, hath fled with tears
<lb/>Of blood at having come.”
<lb/>“How could that foe,”
<lb/>Said Sawa to his son, “get clear away
<lb/>At night from such a countless host as this,
<lb/>And wherefore have the guards been so remiss?”
</p>

</div>

<div><head>§ 9
How King Sawa sent a Message to Bahram Chubina and his Answer</head>
<pb n="113"/>
<p>
<lb/>He sent thereafter to Bahram Chubina
<lb/>A fluent elder, saying: “Go and tell
<lb/>This Persian: ‘Mar not out of foolishness
<lb/>Thy reputation here, for surely thou
<lb/>Must know this much—that that great king of thine
<lb/>Would have thy life and therefore sendeth thee
<lb/>To fight with one nigh peerless in the world.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1816"/>
<lb/>He said to thee: “Go forth and seize their road,”
<lb/>And thou unwillingly didst hear the words,
<lb/>For with my troops and elephants I trample
<lb/>A mountain if it cometh in my path.’”
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing what he said,
<lb/>Smiled at that hasty trafficking and answered:—
<lb/>“If my death be the world-lord’s hidden purpose
<lb/>My duty is to do what pleaseth him
<lb/>Though earth shall take the measure of my height.”
<lb/>The messenger, returning to king Sawa,
<lb/>Reported what he heard the warrior say,
<lb/>And Sawa said: “Go, tell the Persian thus:—
<lb/>'Why talk so much? Why art thou in the field?
<lb/>Ask what thou wilt of me.’”
<lb/>The messenger
<lb/>Went to Bahram Chubina and thus spake:—
<lb/>“Reveal thy purposes because my king
<lb/>Is favoured by the stars and he would have
<lb/>Thee do his will.”
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/>“Say: ‘If thou wouldst do right act openly.
<lb/>If friendship with the monarch of the world
<lb/>Be secretly thy wish I will receive thee
<pb n="114"/>
<lb/>On this march as a guest and pledge myself
<lb/>To grant thee thy desires. I will bestow
<lb/>On thy troops gold and silver, crowns and girdles
<lb/>Upon those worthy of them. I will send
<lb/>The Shah a cavalier that he may come
<lb/>Half way to meet thee and, as equals do,
<lb/>Provide thee provand. If thou art a friend
<lb/>He will make much of thee, but if thou hast
<lb/>Come hither for contention, to the deep,
<lb/>And to the crocodile’s maw, then thou shalt quit
<lb/>The desert of Harat in such a plight
<lb/>That all chiefs shall bewail thee. May a ditch
<lb/>Be at thy door on thy return, may blast
<lb/>Pursue and rain companion thee, for naught
<lb/>But ill luck brought thee hither, being fain
<lb/>That ill befall thy head.’”
<lb/>The messenger
<lb/>Turned back, came like the wind, and gave the answer
<lb/>Of that aspirant. Hearing it king Sawa
<lb/>Was wroth with that stone-hearted opposite;
<lb/>His heart was straitened at that chill response,
<lb/>And thinking of it filled his cheeks with shame.
<lb/>He said: “‘Go, take yon human div this message:—
<lb/>‘Thou hast no fame in war; I would not slay thee.
<lb/>Such as thy Shah are servants at my court,
<lb/>And set by thee my meanest slaves are chiefs.
<lb/>If thou shalt ask for quarter at my hands
<lb/>I will exalt thy head above the throng,
<lb/>Thou shalt have many gifts from me, and all
<lb/>Thy troops shall be enriched; but one aspiring
<milestone unit="calced" n="1817"/>
<lb/>To valour looketh not to futile words
<lb/>And deeds of madness.’”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That proud monarch’s envoy
<lb/>Came to Bahram Chubina and delivered
<lb/>Those biting words which yet were what he wished.
<pb n="115"/>
<lb/>On hearing he informed the man: “Thy lord
<lb/>Must hear my answer: ‘If I am so mean
<lb/>That meanness covereth my head with shame,
<lb/>The king of kings for his part was ashamed
<lb/>To come out in his wrath to fight with thee.
<lb/>"Tis through my meanness that I have marched forth
<lb/>With troops to wreck the kindred of king Sawa.
<lb/>I will cut off his head and carry it
<lb/>Before the Shah; it is not worth my while
<lb/>To stick it on my spear upon the road.
<lb/>For me to grant thee quarter would demean thee,
<lb/>But I will fall upon thee in my meanness.
<lb/>Thou shalt not see me save upon the day
<lb/>Of fight and followed by my dark-blue flag,
<lb/>Because if thou upon that dragon glance
<lb/>"Tis death; thy head and helm shall sheath my lance.’”
</p>

</div>

<div><head>§ 10
How King Sawa and Bahram Chubina set the Battle in Array against each other</head>
<p>
<lb/>King Sawa’s envoy, when he heard those words
<lb/>Of stern defiance, showed his back. He went,
<lb/>And told what he had heard and seen whereat
<lb/>The Turks’ king’s head breathed vengeance and he bade
<lb/>To bring the tymbals forth and to lead out
<lb/>The elephants high-crested to the plain.
<lb/>The realm was darkened with the dust of hoofs,
<lb/>The trumpets blared. Now when Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Heard that a host had come, and plains and vales
<lb/>Were yellow, red, and black, he bade his men
<pb n="116"/>
<lb/>Mount and rode forth in armour, mace in hand.
<lb/>Behind him lay Harat, before a host
<lb/>Of swordsmen. He drew up the wings. The troops
<lb/>Were as one heart and body. Thou hadst said:—
<lb/>“The world is all cuirass; a star is shining
<lb/>On every spear.”
<lb/>King Sawa viewed that field,
<lb/>Its order and array, perceived that while
<lb/>Bahram Chubina rested on Harat
<lb/>His own position was both cramped and ill,
<lb/>And thus addressed his horsemen, veterans,
<lb/>And intimates: “A lying messenger
<lb/>Came from the Persian leader of the folk,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1818"/>
<lb/>And tarried till yon host had seized the city,
<lb/>And left me nothing but a brake of thorns!”
<lb/>He ranked his army in that straitened place,
<lb/>The air was indigo and earth was hidden.
<lb/>Upon the right were two score thousand horsemen,
<lb/>Who used two-headed darts and wielded spears,
<lb/>With two score thousand on the left withal,
<lb/>All archers and engrossers of the fray,
<lb/>While two score thousand warriors formed the centre,
<lb/>Who carried spear or sword, and two score thousand
<lb/>He stationed in the rear; but many troops
<lb/>Were left unused for he was cramped for room.
<lb/>They placed the elephants before the line,
<lb/>As ’twere a wall, and barred the way in front.
<lb/>Thus circumstanced king Sawa’s heart was grieved
<lb/>By reason of this straitening of his host.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: “His fortune hath foreshown
<lb/>To him the presage of an empty throne.”
</p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 11
How King Sawa sent another Message to Bahram Chubina and his Answer</head>
<pb n="117"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then from the champaign of Harat he sent
<lb/>Again a warrior of eloquence,
<lb/>A man all guileful, to Bahram Chubina
<lb/>To say: “Thou hast not wedded heaven’s own fortune:
<lb/>Wilt thou not hear advice and such appeals?
<lb/>Make friends with wisdom, open thine heart’s eyes.
<lb/>Thou hast found two whose equals in the world
<lb/>- Have never yet been born of royal race;
<lb/>They shine like suns in heaven and all the year
<lb/>Are clad in mail, they are so valorous.
<lb/>One is myself, the lawful king of earth;
<lb/>The other is my high-born son Parmuda.
<lb/>My troops are more than leaves upon the trees,
<lb/>Had some the skill to number them. If I
<lb/>Should reckon up my men and elephants
<lb/>Thou wouldest smile at rain-drops from Spring-clouds.
<lb/>There are tents, tent-enclosures, implements
<lb/>Of war beyond conception; shouldst thou count
<lb/>Withal my steeds and men, my wastes and mountains,
<lb/>Thou wouldest marvel. All the other kings,
<lb/>If worthy of such honour, are my lieges.
<lb/>If seas had life<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Si eau de la mer inondait Ja terre.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note> and mountains feet to run
<lb/>They could not carry off my treasury,
<lb/>Arms, implements, and fruitage of my toils.
<lb/>The glorious Great, save for thy Persian lord,
<lb/>Throughout the world acclaim me as their king,
<lb/>And thy life also lieth in my hands
<milestone unit="calced" n="1819"/>
<lb/>As well I know. If I lead on my troops
<pb n="118"/>
<lb/>They will not let pass ant and gnat. Withal
<lb/>I have a thousand barded elephants
<lb/>Whose scent affrayeth horsemen. Who will come
<lb/>To face me from Iran and from Turan,
<lb/>And by such coming aggravate my toils?
<lb/>From this place to the gates of Taisafun.
<lb/>My powers extend, will stay, be amplified.
<lb/>Some one hath duped thee, O mine enemy!
<lb/>Some one, perchance a madman, for thou lov’st not
<lb/>Thyself or else dissemblest since thine eye
<lb/>Discriminateth not ’twixt good and ill.
<lb/>How should such foolishness become the wise?
<lb/>Cease this contention and present thyself
<lb/>Before me, and I will not keep thee waiting,
<lb/>But give to thee high office and my daughter
<lb/>With worship and a crown. Thou shalt receive
<lb/>A lordship at our hands and suffer not
<lb/>The ills that subjects bear, and when the Shah
<lb/>Shall have been slain in fight, and when his crown
<lb/>And throne are mine, on thee will I bestow them
<lb/>With all his treasure, diadem, and goods.
<lb/>Thence will I march on Rum and then the troops,
<lb/>The treasure and the land, will all be thine.
<lb/>Thus have I spoken for thou pleasest me,
<lb/>And wisely hast thou dealt with these affairs.
<lb/>Thou knowest the conduct and the art of war;
<lb/>Thy sire and grandsire held command in chief,
<lb/>So what I say is not mere compliment
<lb/>But pity for thy sake who hast arrayed
<lb/>Thy puny force to fight with me to-day.
<lb/>Thou shalt receive no further messages
<lb/>If thou art retrograde to my desires.”
<pb n="119"/>
<lb/>The envoy spake, the chieftain heard and made
<lb/>A grim response: “O man of evil mark!
<lb/>Among the magnates and the eminent
<lb/>None reverenceth a monarch profitless
<pb n="120"/>
<lb/>And wordy. From thy talk from first to last
<lb/>I have perceived thee confident in speech.
<lb/>The man whose day is ending seeketh prowess
<lb/>In words not deeds. I heard thy feckless parle,
<lb/>Yet my heart quaileth not for fear of harm.
<lb/>As for thy saying: ‘I will slay the Shah,
<lb/>And give thee realm and throne,’ a chief once said:—
<lb/>‘If thou shalt drive a mendicant away
<lb/>From any town is he not sure to say:—
<lb/>“There I was lord; the rest were neath my sway?”’
<lb/>In our affair there will not intervene
<lb/>Two days of sunlight ere I shall dispatch
<milestone unit="calced" n="1820"/>
<lb/>By this same token to the Shah thy head
<lb/>Upon a spear. Again, for what thou saidest
<lb/>About thy daughter, treasure, troops, and realm,
<lb/>I should have thanked thee once and should have called thee
<lb/>A monarch of discernment thus to give,
<lb/>Without designs upon the Iranian throne,
<lb/>Thy daughter to me and with her dispatch
<lb/>A gorgeous throne and goods. Then thou hadst had
<lb/>Myself for friend within Iran, not fought
<lb/>Against its warriors; but now my lance
<lb/>Is at thine ear and with my sword will I
<lb/>Behead thee, and when thou hast gone thy pate,
<lb/>Thy crown and treasure, are mine, and mine withal
<lb/>Thy daughter and the fruit of thy past toils.
<lb/>Thou saidest further: ‘I have crowns and thrones
<lb/>With elephants and horsemen past compute.’
<lb/>A chief said, battling in the ranks of war:—
<lb/>‘The longer water is denied a hound
<lb/>The greater will his eagerness be found.’
<lb/>The divs seduced thy heart so that thou camest
<lb/>To fight the Shah and thou wilt writhe beneath
<lb/>God’s chastisement and for thine evil deeds.
<pb n="121"/>
<lb/>Again, thou sayest: ‘I have among my lieges
<lb/>Great men possessed of crowns and coronets,
<lb/>And all the cities of the world are mine.’
<lb/>The age herein is witness to thy words.
<lb/>To cities roads are open, lord and liege
<lb/>May tramp the marches, but if thou shalt knock
<lb/>Upon a city-gate thy kingship there
<lb/>Will prove a brake of thorns. As for thine offer
<lb/>To pardon me—a craven in thine eyes—
<lb/>Thou wilt forgive me not when thou hast seen
<lb/>My spear and shalt not have me as a liege.
<lb/>As for thy troops, desires, and policy,
<lb/>Thy mighty elephants and throne, what time
<lb/>I rank mine army I account them naught,
<lb/>And care no jot for all thy warriors.
<lb/>Though thou art king thou utterest such lies
<lb/>That thou wilt gain no glory in the world.
<lb/>For what thou saidest: ‘I approve of thee,
<lb/>And would select thee as my general,’
<lb/>What I approve, since reaching man’s estate,
<lb/>Is the approval of the king of kings.
<lb/>I have allowed the king three days and when
<lb/>The Glory of the Lustre of the world
<lb/>Shall show, the army in Iran shall see
<lb/>Thy head upon a spear before the Shah.”
<lb/>The messenger returned with cheeks like gall,
<lb/>And fruitful, youthful fortune waxen old.
<lb/>He told king Sawa what the answer was,
<lb/>And at his words the monarch’s visage loured.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1821"/>
<lb/>Said the Faghfur: "What feebleness is this?
<lb/>Yon little host should rather ask our tears.”
<lb/>Then to the entry of the camp-enclosure
<lb/>He went and bade bring forth the Indian bells,
<lb/>Gongs, mighty elephants, and kettledrums,
<lb/>And make heaven ebon-hued. While that famed youth
<lb/>Prepared to fight the haughty monarch mused;
<lb/>Then to his son: “Thou chosen of the troops!
<lb/>Refrain from fighting till to-morrow morn.”
<lb/>The troops withdrew on both sides and the watch
<lb/>Went from the tent-enclosures. In both hosts
<lb/>They kindled fires, and rumour filled all coasts.

<div><head>§ 12
How Bahram Chubina had a Dream in the Night, how he gave Battle the next Morning, and how King Sawa was slain</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina was alone
<lb/>Within his tent he sent and<note>Reading with P.</note> called the Iranians,
<lb/>And with his troops took counsel for the fight
<lb/>Till dark, till Turk and Persian both reposed,
<lb/>And he that would might have the world for naught;
<lb/>But brave Bahram Chubina still mused war,
<lb/>While sleeping in his tent. That Lion dreamed
<lb/>That in the fight the Turks proved valorous,
<lb/>While his own troops were routed and himself,
<lb/>Debarred more strife, unsuccoured and afoot,
<lb/>Asked quarter of the heroes of the foe.
<lb/>He woke in grief, his noble head sore troubled,
<lb/>With pain and sorrow passed the hours of dark,
<lb/>Arrayed himself but told to none his dream.
<lb/>Just then arrived Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Who had escaped king Sawa, and spake thus:<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>“What confidence is this? Behold the snare
<lb/>Of Ahriman and give not to the winds Iranian lives but treat these nobles fairly;
<lb/>For valour’s sake take pity on thy life,
<lb/>For nevermore will such a task confront thee.”
<lb/>“Thy city,” said Bahram Chubina, “yieldeth
<lb/>No valour save thy sample, for all there
<pb n="122"/>
<lb/>Sell fish from Summer-time<note>Tammuz</note> till snow-storms come.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1822"/>
<lb/>Thy work is net and pond; thou art no man
<lb/>For spear and mace and arrow. When the sun
<lb/>Shall rise o’er yon dark mountains I will show thee
<lb/>How kings and soldiers fight. Thou shalt behold
<lb/>Those elephants and troops of his and all
<lb/>His fair presentment prostrate in the dust.”
<lb/>When Sol arose from Leo, and the world
<lb/>Grew white as Ruman’s face, the trumpet sounded,
<lb/>The battle-cry went up, earth shook beneath
<lb/>The horses’ hoofs, Bahram Chubina ranged
<lb/>His host and mounting grasped a war-worn mace.
<lb/>They furnished for the right three thousand men,
<lb/>All-cavaliers mail-clad and veteran.
<lb/>He sent an equal number to the left,
<lb/>All valiant, vengeful horsemen. On the right
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, who rode through rivers, led,
<lb/>And on the left Kanda Gashasp who worshipped
<lb/>The glorious Azargashasp. Yalan-sina
<lb/>Supported them with troops as a reserve.
<lb/>Hamdan Gashasp was posted in the van,
<lb/>A man whose horse-shoes set the reeds ablaze.
<lb/>With each there were three thousand warriors,
<lb/>All fighting cavaliers with hearts of stone.
<lb/>It was proclaimed: “Ye chiefs with golden crowns!
<lb/>Whoe’er, though faced by lion or by pard,
<lb/>Shall flee the fight, by God! I will behead him,
<lb/>And burn his useless carcase in the fire.”
<lb/>On each side of the host there was a road
<lb/>Whereby he<note>Bahram Chubina</note> might retreat. On each he raised
<lb/>A bank ten cubits high. His own position
<lb/>Was at the centre, and to him there came
<lb/>The archscribe<note>Mihran. See p. 106.</note> of the king of kings and said:—
<lb/>“This is beyond thy power and thus to mock
<lb/>At fortune cannot prosper. Of the troops
<pb n="123"/>
<lb/>Upon this field we are the one white hair,
<lb/>Note, on a sable ox! No soil or stream,
<lb/>Or hill is visible, so many are
<lb/>The swordsmen of Turan!”
<lb/>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Cried at him furiously: “Thou recreant wretch!
<lb/>Thy business is with inkstand and with paper:
<lb/>Who bade thee take the number of the host?”
<lb/>The scribe approached Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>And said: “Bahram Chubina and the Div
<lb/>Are mates!”
<lb/>Those scribes then sought a way to flee
<lb/>That they might not behold that day of doom.
<lb/>They feared both king of kings and arrow-rain,
<lb/>And bit their lips. On one side and afar
<lb/>From those Turanian horsemen they beheld
<lb/>A height precipitous and thither fared
<milestone unit="calced" n="1823"/>
<lb/>A-tremble, saying: “We must watch the host.”
<lb/>They gazed upon Bahram Chubina’s helm
<lb/>To see how he would fight when roused. That hero,
<lb/>When he had drawn his host up, left the field,
<lb/>And with loud outcries, prostrate in the dust
<lb/>Before his God, exclaimed: “O righteous Judge!
<lb/>If in thy sight this conflict is unjust,
<lb/>And thou preferrest Sawa to myself,
<lb/>Give my heart rest in battle and to Sawa
<lb/>His whole desire upon the Iranians;
<lb/>But if I undergo this toil for Thee,
<lb/>And risk my head in fight, make jubilant
<lb/>Me and my troops and by our combating
<lb/>The world all prosperous.”
<lb/>Still praying loudly
<lb/>He mounted with his ox-head mace in hand.<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>King Sawa thus addressed his host: “Begin
<lb/>Your incantations that the Iranians
<pb n="124"/>
<lb/>May quail in heart and eye, and no disaster
<lb/>Befall yourselves.”
<lb/>Then all the sorcerers
<lb/>Began their spells and hurled fire through the air.<note>Three couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>Rose blast and murky cloud whence arrows showered
<lb/>Upon the Iranians. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Exclaimed: “Chiefs, magnates of Iran, and heroes!
<lb/>Shut ye your eyes to all these magic arts,
<lb/>And come all wroth to fight, for this is naught
<lb/>But trick and sorcery, and they that use
<lb/>Such means demand our tears.”
<lb/>The Iranians shouted,
<lb/>And girt their loins for bloodshed, while king Sawa
<lb/>Surveyed the field, saw that the foe recoiled not
<lb/>At those black arts but came on all the more,
<lb/>Led by Bahram Chubina, and assailed,
<lb/>Like wolf a lamb, their left, brake it and charged,
<lb/>Like one bemused, Bahram Chubina’s centre,
<lb/>Who thence saw how his soldiers fled the foe,
<lb/>Came, with his spear unhorsed three warriors,
<lb/>And dashed them headlong to the ground, exclaiming:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1824"/>
<lb/>“This is the way to fight, this is the mode,
<lb/>And how to do it! Are ye not ashamed
<lb/>Before the Lord of earth, the glorious chiefs,
<lb/>And nobles?”
</p>
<pb n="125"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then he made toward the right,
<lb/>As ’twere a lusty lion famishing,
<lb/>And broke the mighty force opposed to him,
<lb/>So that their leader’s banner disappeared.
<lb/>Thence he departed to his army’s centre,
<lb/>To where the leader was among the troops,
<lb/>And said to him: “Perdition take it all!
<lb/>If this fight lasts the host will be dispersed!
<lb/>Look out in what direction to retreat.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They went and sought; there was not any way
<lb/>Because the proper road was mounded over.
<lb/>Then to that leader said Bahram Chubina:
<lb/>“There is an iron wall in front of us,
<lb/>And only he that knoweth how to make
<lb/>A breach therein can gain the other side,
<lb/>Safeguard himself and carry to Iran,
<lb/>And to the monarch of the brave, his life.
<lb/>All put your whole heart in it, shield your heads,
<lb/>And ply your swords. If sleepless fortune helps us
<lb/>It will repay our toils with thrones and crowns.
<lb/>Let none despair of God or ye may see
<lb/>Your white day turn to gloom.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>King Sawa thus
<lb/>Harangued his chiefs: “Advance the elephants
<lb/>Before the host, attack in force, and make
<lb/>The world both dark and narrow to our foes.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina from afar beheld
<lb/>The elephants, was grieved, unsheathed his sword,
<lb/>And thus addressed his captains: "Warriors famed!
<lb/>String up your bows of Chach and helm ye all.
<lb/>Now by the life and head of this world’s king,
<lb/>The chosen of the lords and crown of chiefs,
<lb/>Let every one that hath artillery
<lb/>String up his bow perforce and let him fix
<lb/>His arrows, fashioned out of triple wood,
<lb/>Whose points are keen for blood, upon the trunks
<lb/>Of yonder elephants, then out with mace,
<lb/>On to the fight, and slay your enemies.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The chieftain strung his bow and set a casque
<lb/>Of steel upon his head. He made his bow
<lb/>As ’twere a cloud in Spring and showered arrows
<lb/>Before the host: the soldiers followed him.
<lb/>The stars were dimmed by pointed, feathered shafts.
<lb/>They pierced the elephants’ trunks, and dale and plain
</p>

<pb n="126"/>

<p>
<lb/>Grew like a pool of blood. The elephants
<lb/>Turned from the smart and fled the battlefield.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1825"/>
<lb/>Now when the elephants were smitten thus
<lb/>They trampled their own troops. The Iranian host
<lb/>Came on behind and earth grew like the Nile.
<lb/>All was confusion; many died; ill fortune
<lb/>Had all its will of them. There was a spot,
<lb/>A pleasant place, behind that stricken host
<lb/>Where, on a golden throne, fierce Sawa sat.
<lb/>He saw his army like an iron mountain
<lb/>In flight with heads all dust and souls all gloom,
<lb/>While from behind enormous elephants
<lb/>Beyond control were trampling down the troops.
<lb/>He wept for wherefore should his army flee?
<lb/>And mounting his bay Arab fled himself
<lb/>In dire dismay. Bahram Chubina came
<lb/>Pursuing like an elephant run mad,
<lb/>A lasso on his arm, a bow in hand,
<lb/>And shouted to his troops: "Illustrious men!
<lb/>Ill fate hath marked them out.<note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note> Rain swords on them,
<lb/>And quit you in the fight like cavaliers."
<lb/>He reached the hill where erst king Sawa sat
<lb/>Crowned on a throne of gold, beheld him thence
<lb/>Upon his mighty lion of an Arab,
<lb/>And sped forth like a tiger o’er the waste.
<lb/>He chose an arrow with a glittering point,
<lb/>Plumed with four eagle’s feathers, took in hand
<lb/>His bow of Chach and laid the deer-hide thong
<lb/>Within his thumb-stall, straightened his left arm,
<lb/>And bent his right. The bow twanged as he loosed
<lb/>The shaft and pierced king Sawa’s spine, who came
<lb/>Down headlong to the dust; the ground beneath him
<lb/>Was soaked with blood. Of that great host the king
<lb/>Bediademed was gone, gone golden throne,
</p>

<pb n="127"/>

<p>
<lb/>And golden crown. :
<lb/>Such deeds the turning sky
<lb/>Doth, showing neither love nor enmity.
<lb/>Joy not in lofty throne and greatly fear,
<lb/>What time thou feel’st secure, disaster near.
<lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina came and dragged
<lb/>The corpse face downward wallowing in the dust,
<lb/>And severed that crowned head while none of all
<lb/>Its kindred came anear. When the Turks found
<lb/>Their king the corpse lay headless on the road.
<lb/>All wailed; cries filled the earth; the air resounded,
<lb/>And he that was the son of Sawa said:—
<lb/>"This is God’s doing, for unsleeping fortune
<lb/>Is with Bahram Chubina."
<milestone unit="calced" n="1826"/>
<lb/>Multitudes
<lb/>Died in the strait defiles. The elephants
<lb/>Trod many under foot; not one in ten
<lb/>Of all that host escaped. They perished crushed
<lb/>Beneath the elephants or were beheaded
<lb/>Upon the battlefield, and when nine hours
<lb/>Of that ill day had gone the Iranians saw
<lb/>No enemy alive save prisoners bound,
<lb/>Their souls and bodies pierced with grief and shafts.
<lb/>The route was strewn with bards and helms whose heads
<lb/>Were suffocate therein,<note n="2"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">de casques qui n’avaient pas garanti ce jour-là les têtes contre la mort.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note> with Indian swords,
<lb/>With arrows and with bows dropped by the foe
<lb/>On all sides. Earth was like a sea of blood
<lb/>With slain, and everywhere were saddled steeds.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina went his rounds to learn
<lb/>Who had been slain upon the Iranian side;
<lb/>Then said he to Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
<lb/>"Give me thine aid to-day and ascertain
<lb/>What slain Iranians it is ours to mourn."
</p>

<pb n="128"/>

<p>
<lb/>He went through all the tents. One man of worship
<lb/>Was missing in the host—a chieftain named
<lb/>Bahram, who was the son of Sityawush,
<lb/>A valiant prince, a magnate of Iran,
<lb/>Descended from a captain of the host.
<lb/>Like one insane Kharrad went forth in quest
<lb/>Of traces of him, moving many a form
<lb/>Of slain and wounded men but found no sign.
<lb/>The captain of the host was grieved thereat,
<lb/>And cried: "Alas! thou prudent warrior!"
<lb/>Howbeit the man himself appeared anon,
<lb/>A key to that locked door, and with a Turk
<lb/>Red-haired, cat-eyed, and, as thou wouldst have said,
<lb/>With heart all wrung with rage. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Cried when he saw Bahram: "Ne’er be it thine
<lb/>To wed the dust!" then of that foul Turk asked:—
<lb/>"O thou hell-visaged, banned from Paradise!
<lb/>What man art thou? What is thy name and birth,
<lb/>For she who bare thee will have cause to weep?"
<lb/>He said: "A warlock I. I meddle not
<lb/>With manhood and with manliness but help
<lb/>My chief in battle when things reach a pass,
<lb/>And make him dream of what will hearten him.
<lb/>I gave thee that ill dream last night to bring
<lb/>Ill on thy head, but I must seek for means
<lb/>More potent<note n="3">Reading with P.</note> for my sorcery hath failed,
<lb/>Ill-fortune hath recoiled upon my head,
<lb/>And all my toil is wedded to the wind.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1827"/>
<lb/>If I get quarter from thee thou hast gained
<lb/>An all-accomplished friend."
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Bahram Chubina mused, his heart was troubled,
<lb/>His visage wan. Anon he said: "This man
<lb/>Might prove of service in the stress of fight,"
</p>

<pb n="129"/>

<p>
<lb/>But said again: "What did king Sawa profit
<lb/>Through this dark-dealing warlock? All good things
<lb/>Descend from God on fortune’s favourites,"
<lb/>Then bade cut off his head and robbed of life
<lb/>His feckless form, which done Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Stood up and said: "O just and upright Judge!
<lb/>From Thee are greatness, victory, the glory,
<lb/>High place, the diadem of king of kings,
<lb/>Distress and joy. Blest is the warrior
<lb/>That followeth Thy way."
<lb/>The archscribe came,
<lb/>And spake thus: "Valiant Faridun, Bahram,<note>Bahram Gur probably is meant.</note>
<lb/>And Nushirwan ne’er saw one like to thee,
<lb/>O lusty paladin! Possessed art thou
<lb/>Of lion’s courage, counsel, and device.
<lb/>May no calamity befall thy life.
<lb/>Through thee the cities of Iran all live,
<lb/>And all the paladins are but thy slaves.
<lb/>Through thee the exalted throne hath been exalted,
<lb/>And every liege escaped mishap. Thou art
<lb/>A chieftain and a chieftain’s son, and blest
<lb/>Is she that brought forth such a child, for thou
<lb/>Art glorious by birth and enterprise,
<lb/>A king all absolute in Grace and wisdom."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the Shah’s paladins and men of might
<lb/>Dispersed themselves and left the scene of fight.

How Bahram Chibina sent a Letter announcing his
Victory, and the Head of King Sawa, to Hurmuz, and his Answer</head>
<p>
<lb/>When night had curled its locks and sent thereby
<lb/>The eye to sleep, and when the Ebon Veil
<lb/>Bahram Gur probably is meant.
<pb n="130"/>
<lb/>Appeared, the world had respite from the drum.
<lb/>Meanwhile the wheel of heaven turned apace
<lb/>In view of darksome night and hurried on
<lb/>Till from the deep a Golden Vessel rose,
<lb/>And travail waxed and slumber faded away.
<lb/>Then came the captain of the host and sent
<lb/>Someone to bid his comrades good at need:—
<lb/>“All those that have been slain among the chiefs,
<lb/>War-cavaliers and captains of the Turks,
<lb/>Each leader of the folk, behead and set
<milestone unit="calced" n="1828"/>
<lb/>Behind the heads of all of them that were
<lb/>Those warriors’ diadem a flaunting flag.”
<lb/>He had the captives and the heads collected,
<lb/>And carried from the field, then called a scribe
<lb/>And spake at large of that famed, countless host,
<lb/>The movements and the day’s vicissitudes,
<lb/>The battle and<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> the divers stratagems
<lb/>That he had used against so vast a foe,
<lb/>The toils and fighting of the Iranians,
<lb/>And how no horsemen loosed his belt all day.
<lb/>When he had written to the Shah he chose
<lb/>A courier from the troops, first put upon
<lb/>A lance the head of Sawa, then bade bear
<lb/>The standard of that monarch and the heads
<lb/>Of those chiefs of Turan and cavaliers
<lb/>Of Chin withal upon a dromedary
<lb/>With all speed to the Shah. The prisoners,
<lb/>And whatsoever spoil there was he kept
<lb/>Intact within Harat until the king
<lb/>Should make his pleasure known. He sent withal
<lb/>Experienced horsemen to escort the heads,
<lb/>And to obtain permission from the Shah
<lb/>To march against Parmuda with the host.
<lb/>The dromedary started, and a guide
<lb/>Led on the cavaliers who toiled and trod
<pb n="131"/>
<lb/>The way that quickly they might see the Shah,
<lb/>And greet him from the paladin and chiefs.
<lb/>Upon their side the Turks all destitute
<lb/>Went horseless, weaponless, and baggageless,
<lb/>And both their cavaliers and those of Chin
<lb/>Returned toward Turan. Now when the news
<lb/>Came to Parmuda he put off his crown,
<lb/>While from the Turks arose a grievous wail;
<lb/>The day was bitter for those chiefs; all heads
<lb/>Were full of dust, all eyes of tears, and none
<lb/>Ate or reposed or slumbered. Then he summoned
<lb/>The warriors and, weeping his heart’s blood,
<lb/>Inquired of them: “Why did that countless host
<lb/>Prove impotent upon the day of battle?”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>A counsellor replied: <q>We held the foe
<lb/>To be but weak, but none will see in time
<lb/>Of action such another cavalier
<lb/>As brave Bahram Chubina. Not one man
<lb/>For every century of ours had he,
<lb/>Yet not a youth of his brave troops was wounded,
<lb/>For God directed him! I might say more,
<lb/>But thou hast heard enough.</q>
<lb/>On this Parmuda
<lb/>Reflected on Bahram Chubina’s deeds,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1829"/>
<lb/>Was wroth, turned pale of cheek, and was resolved
<lb/>In his distress of heart to battle on.
<lb/>A hundred thousand of the host remained—
<lb/>All men of name and ready for the fray.
<lb/>He led his army plain-ward from the camp
<lb/>Toward the Jihun in order to avenge
<lb/>His noble father on Bahram Chubina.
<lb/>What time the letter of that paladin
<lb/>Came to the Shah of ardent soul that world-lord
<lb/>Was sitting on his throne and holding forth
<lb/>Concerning his own fortune to the court:—
<lb/>“Strange! that no tidings of Bahram Chubina
<pb n="132"/>
<lb/>Have reached our court! What say ye, and henceforth
<lb/>What shall we do? We must advise thereon.”
<lb/>Now as he spake the words the chamberlain
<lb/>Came from the gate and brought the king of kings
<lb/>The glad news: <q>May the Shah rejoice for ever!
<lb/>Bahram Chubina hath prevailed o’er Sawa,
<lb/>And grown the lustre of the world in fight.</q>
<lb/>At once the Shah called in the messenger
<lb/>Sent by Bahram Chubina, seating him
<lb/>Above the nobles present, and inquired
<lb/>Concerning host and paladin and those
<lb/>Illustrious and glorious warriors.
<lb/>The messenger replied: <q>Exalted Shah!
<lb/>The battle went as thou didst wish. Mayst thou
<lb/>Live ever happily and joyously,
<lb/>For thy foe’s fortune hath grown old. The heads
<lb/>Both of king Sawa and his younger son—
<lb/>Him whom his father used to call Faghfur—
<lb/>Are at thy gate on spears—a sight for all
<lb/>The city.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this, the king of kings
<lb/>Rose, quickly bowed, and standing in God’s presence
<lb/>Said: <q>O Thou righteous Guide! Thou hast destroyed
<lb/>Our foes, Thou Fashioner of sun and moon!
<lb/>Great was my wretchedness and my despair
<lb/>What time the foe came headlong from his throne!
<lb/>‘Twas neither chieftain nor the warrior-host
<lb/>That did this, but God’s goodness to His slave.</q>
<lb/>Then from the treasures that his sire had left
<lb/>He had a hundred thousand drachms brought forth,
<lb/>With one third first gave largess to the poor,
<lb/>But the more part to his own servitors,
<lb/>And sent the Fanes of Fire another third,
<lb/>There to be given over to the priests
<pb n="133"/>
<lb/>To grace the Feasts of New Year and of Sada.
<lb/>With what was left men sought out and repaired
<lb/>The ruined sites and caravansaries
<lb/>In desert places, rendering the roads
<milestone unit="calced" n="1830"/>
<lb/>Secure and easy. He remitted imposts
<lb/>For four years to the poor, and subject kings,
<lb/>And then had letters written to each province,
<lb/>To all the nobles, thus: <q>‘Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Hath triumphed o’er the foe and with his sword
<lb/>Cut off king Sawa’s head.</q>
<lb/>The Shah next passed
<lb/>Two weeks in prayer; then when the world’s light rose
<lb/>He called the envoy of the paladin,
<lb/>And seated him rejoicing ’mongst the lords;
<lb/>Then wrote an answer instantly and set
<lb/>A tree within the garth of majesty,
<lb/>Sent too a silver throne and golden boots,
<lb/>And wealth of all sorts. All that lay between
<lb/>Haital and the great river<note>The Oxus</note> he bestowed
<lb/>On that bold paladin<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> and bade: <q>‘Distribute
<lb/>Spoil ta’en on way and waste among the troops
<lb/>Except king Sawa’s private property;
<lb/>Let that be sent to court. This done, make war
<lb/>Upon Parmuda till he is o’erthrown.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuz sent gifts too to the Iranians,
<lb/>Confirmed by letters written to each city.
<lb/>They gave the messenger a robe of honour,
<lb/>And called thereafter for the nobles’ steeds.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, when the envoy came,
<lb/>Joyed well content and gave the troops much booty,
<lb/>Except the wealth pertaining to king Sawa,
<lb/>The impure of heart; this he dispatched with horsemen,
<lb/>Famed veterans of his kin, who bore it all
<pb n="134"/>
<lb/>To court what while the chieftain went his way,
<lb/>He and his army, to renew the fray.</p>

<div><head>§ 14
How Bahram Chubina fought with Parmuda, Son of
King Sawa, and overcame him, and how Parmida took Refuge in the Hold of Awdza</head>
<p>
<lb/>Parmuda, when news came <q>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Is seeking for the throne of empire,</q> held
<lb/>A stronghold hight Awdza where he joyed
<lb/>Secure. Therein he stored whate’er he had
<lb/>Of money, jewels, and of other treasures,
<lb/>And passing with his army o’er Jihun
<lb/>Proceeded proudly to the seat of war.
<lb/>The hosts drew near for battle, dallying not
<lb/>Upon the march, and chose a fitting field
<lb/>Two stages out of Balkh. Between the hosts
<lb/>Two leagues of plain lay suitable for fight.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1831"/>
<lb/>The next day brave Bahram Chubina went
<lb/>To view Parmiuda’s warriors. Parmuda
<lb/>Looked, saw him, and chose out upon the waste
<lb/>A steep height and there ranged his host until
<lb/>The plain was full. Thence he beheld a power,
<lb/>Whose aspect dazed the desert, and in front
<lb/>Bahram Chubina with his warlike head
<lb/>Exalted to the sky, was grieved and spake,
<lb/>Addressing his own troops: <q>A mighty lion
<lb/>Is fitting mate for this protagonist!
<lb/>One cannot see the sum of his array,
<lb/>But would not care to fight with them. The leader
<lb/>Is proud and fierce. The dark dust under him
<lb/>Will turn to blood. At night, when it is dark,
<lb/>Make we a camisade and banish care
<lb/>And terror from our hearts.</q>
<pb n="135"/>
<lb/>Now when Parmiuda
<lb/>Returned to camp he canvassed schemes for fight,
<lb/>And said: <q>It is an excellence of theirs
<lb/>That though their troops are few their horse are splendid,
<lb/>And in the chief degree of warriors,
<lb/>Well armed, and have for chief Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>A man to whom spears are as thorns and weeds,
<lb/>With heart elate at conquering king Sawa,
<lb/>And drunk with gore; yet by the Maker’s aid
<lb/>I will require from that huge Mountain-mass
<lb/>The vengeance owing for my father’s blood.</q>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina left Iran
<lb/>To fight the Turks a reader of the stars
<lb/>Said: <q>Stir not on the Wednesday of each week,
<lb/>Or harm will follow, and thy whole emprise
<lb/>Prove profitless.</q>
<lb/>Between the hosts there lay
<lb/>A garden bordered by the battlefield,
<lb/>And on the Wednesday of the week at dawn
<lb/>Bahram Chubina thither went and said:—
<lb/><q>We will be glad to-day.</q>
<lb/>They carried thither
<lb/>Rich carpetings; he took wine, meat, and minstrels,
<lb/>And coming to that garden revelled there.
<lb/>Now when a watch of darksome night had passed
<lb/>The outposts brought Parmiuda the report:—
<lb/><q>Bahram Chubina revelleth in the garden.</q>
<lb/>The chieftain chose among his warriors
<lb/>‘Six thousand cavaliers, all valiant men,
<lb/>And sent them forth without lights to surround
<lb/>The garth and take the Iranian chiefs. Now when
<lb/>Bahram Chubina was aware thereof,
<lb/>And of the plan and purpose of Parmida,
<lb/>He thus addressed Yalan-sina: <q>O chieftain!
<pb n="136"/>
<lb/>Break us a passage through the garden-wall.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina and Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>With other warriors, mounted on their steeds.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1832"/>
<lb/>They issued from the breach; who knoweth how
<lb/>Those warriors issued? At the garden-gate
<lb/>Arose the clarion-blare: the chieftain charged.
<lb/>They quickly made a second breach and smote
<lb/>The foe. Bahram Chubina, dart in hand,
<lb/>And half bemused, assailed them. Few escaped him,
<lb/>So eager was his drunken head for blood!
<lb/>As when smiths’ hammers meet the steel so rang
<lb/>The chieftains’ blows, and trunkless heads were strewn
<lb/>Between the garth and king Parmuda’s camp.
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina had returned
<lb/>To his own camp he planned a camisade,
<lb/>And, midnight past, girt up his loins and led
<lb/>His powers against the foe. Among the Turks
<lb/>There was no scout that saw him. When he reached
<lb/>His fighting-ground the blare of trumpets rose.
<lb/>Roused in the darkness by the clarions’ din
<lb/>The warrior Turks leaped up, and such a shout
<lb/>As would have split a mighty lion’s ears,
<lb/>Ascended.<note>Couplet omitted.</note> None knew who another was
<lb/>Amid the lengthy lances and the gloom.
<lb/>The Iranians made their swords flash fire and set
<lb/>The earth and air ablaze. Of those brave Turks
<lb/>But few were left; the stones were coralline
<lb/>With blood. Like flying dust the leader fled,
<lb/>Dry-mouthed and livid-lipped, and thus it was
<lb/>Till dawn began to breathe and sombre night
<lb/>Drew in its skirts, and then the Iranian chief
<lb/>O’ertook the foe and roaring like a lion
<lb/>Cried to Parmida: <q>O thou runaway!
<lb/>Mix not henceforth with warriors. Thou’rt no man
<pb n="137"/>
<lb/>Of battle but a very child: ’tis fit
<lb/>Thou suck thy mother’s milk.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The king replied:—
<lb/><q>How long, O ravening lion! wilt thou be
<lb/>Thus keen for bloodshed? Crocodiles in water,
<lb/>And pards on land, grow satiate with the blood
<lb/>Of heroes in the fight. Will naught sate thee?
<lb/>Methinketh that thou art a ravening lion,
<lb/>Thou who hast stricken off king Sawa’s head—
<lb/>A man beloved through life by circling heaven—
<lb/>And slaughtered so his troops that sun and moon
<lb/>Feel ruth for them, while as for me who am
<lb/>That valiant king’s memorial, know that thou
<lb/>Hast slain me too with sheer distress. We all
<milestone unit="calced" n="1833"/>
<lb/>Are mother-born for death and have surrendered
<lb/>Our necks thereto since remedy is none.<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>I flee; thou followest but wilt not take me
<lb/>Till my time come. If sword in hand I turn
<lb/>Upon thee either of us may be slain.
<lb/>Be not so hasty and so hot of head,
<lb/>For that becometh neither chief nor host.
<lb/>Now will I fare to mine own tent and there
<lb/>Seek to retrace my steps. I will indite
<lb/>A letter to the king in fashion such
<lb/>As fortune maketh needful, and if he
<lb/>Accept me and protect me from attack
<lb/>I will become a bondslave at his court,
<lb/>And wholly banish lordship from my heart.
<lb/>Put from thee war and strife. Thou camest to fight;
<lb/>Now feast in all good will.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>On hearing this, turned back, for that curst foe
<lb/>Had grown so gracious. When the troops had rested,
<pb n="138"/>
<lb/>And come to king Parmiuda’s camp, they fared
<lb/>About the field, cut off the chieftains’ heads,
<lb/>And heaped them till the pile grew mountain-like:
<lb/>The hero’s men of name called it Bahram Tal.<note>Tal is a heap or mound.</note>
<lb/>Whate’er they saw of horsemen’s equipage,
<lb/>And other booty, they assembled there.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina wrote the king a letter
<lb/>About Parmiuda and his countless host,
<lb/>Narrating <q>all that hath befallen us
<lb/>Both from the Turks and from their warlike king,
<lb/>Whose heart was eager to avenge his sire,
<lb/>And who departed to Awaza hence.</q>
<lb/>Parmida, on his side, made fast the hold,
<lb/>And sat down deep in thought, while in pursuit
<lb/>Came countless troops and circled it about;
<lb/>But though so many leaguered it none knew
<lb/>Parmida’s plans. Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>The toils of war are better than delay,</q>
<lb/>And so he told Yal-an-sina to choose
<lb/>Three thousand of the horsemen on the field,
<lb/>And further that Izid Gashasp should call
<lb/>To horse four thousand warriors of the troops.
<lb/>He bade behead forthwith all whom they found,
<lb/>Thus haply from the hold the king to draw
<lb/>When all the waste a-stream with blood he saw.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When one hath made a trade of shedding blood,
<lb/>And harassing the hearts of enemies,
<lb/>Men will shed his blood also by the token
<lb/>That he hath shed the blood of other chiefs.
<lb/>Wreck though thou mayst the country of the Turks
<lb/>Still in the end they will exact revenge.
<lb/>If I shall come to thee forthwith I fear
<lb/>That thou wilt make an end of me. Thou art
<lb/>A slave; I am a king. Shall I abase me
<pb n="141"/>
<lb/>Before a thrall? I will not come to battle
<lb/>Without a host or those that wish me well
<lb/>Will call me mad; but it is no disgrace
<lb/>For me to ask for quarter from thy Shah
<lb/>In mine extremity. When that is done
<lb/>The hold, the treasure, and the men are thine;
<lb/>Thy wishes will be law in this famed land.’”
<lb/>The messenger returned with this reply;
<lb/>Bahram Chubina was rejoiced thereby.

How Bahram Chubina asked of Hurmuzd a Warrant to spare the Life of Parmida and the Answer</head>
<p>
<lb/>They wrote a letter that might bear good fruit
<lb/>To that victorious and exalted Shah:—
<lb/>“The Khan of Chin is suppliant for quarter;
<lb/>He is beleaguered by Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And needeth a safe-conduct under seal;
<lb/>The news thereof will be a feast to him.
<lb/>Now since the suppliant is the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Fall’n from such dignity to wretchedness,
<lb/>The king of kings should pity one whose worship
<lb/>Hath passed away.”
<lb/>Now when the letter reached
<lb/>The Shah he cloudward raised his glorious crown.
<lb/>He sent and summoned the Iranians,
<lb/>And set them by the famous throne of kingship,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1836"/>
<lb/>Bade read the letter and strew gems upon
<lb/>The reader, saying: <q>I thank my God and praise Him
<lb/>Three watches of the night in that the Khan
<lb/>Of Chin is now our subject and high heaven
<pb n="142"/>
<lb/>Our crown. He raised his head to touch the sky,
<lb/>And thought himself the monarch of the world;
<lb/>But now this leader who attacked our coasts
<lb/>Is made the slave of one still mightier,
<lb/>And so the Turks’ chief and the prince of Chin
<lb/>Is offering his homage unto us.
<lb/>Praise to the Ruler of the sun and moon,
<lb/>The Source of this supremacy of ours.<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>Do ye too offer praise to God and be
<lb/>More instant in the practice of all good.</q>
<lb/>He called the envoy of the paladin,
<lb/>Gave him a long and gracious interview,
<lb/>Called for a girdle set with royal gems,
<lb/>A kingly robe of honour and a steed
<lb/>With trappings decked with gold and every buckle
<lb/>Bejewelled. To the messenger withal
<lb/>He gave dinars, a purse, and much beside
<lb/>To be a present to that prudent man,<note>Bahram Chubina</note>
<lb/>Whom he held chief among the paladins,
<lb/>Bade come a scribe and had a letter written
<lb/>On silk: <q>‘Parmuda Khan is mine ally,
<lb/>And in all regions under my protection.
<lb/>God is the witness to this deed and seal;
<lb/>His slaves are we and He is Lord.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He wrote
<lb/>An answer also to that world-aspirant,<note>Bahram Chubina</note>
<lb/>A letter all good will like Paradise,
<lb/>And said: <q>‘Dispatch Parmuda to my court
<lb/>With all observance but without his host.
<lb/>The booty that thou tookest from his troops—
<lb/>A service which thou didst right zealously—
<lb/>Send thither too, whate’er of it is worthy.
<lb/>The Maker aideth thee. Spy out the foe,
<lb/>And if he hath a stronghold let thy guards

<lb/>And world-illuming presages. If thou

<lb/>State thy demands in writing; we will send
<lb/>Whatever troops are needed. In thy letter
<lb/>Name those Iranians that have acted well

How Hurmuzd’s Letter granting Quarter to Parmiuda reached Bahram Chubina, and how Bahram
Chubina was wroth with Parmida</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1837"/>
<lb/>Now when this letter reached the paladin
<lb/>That famous chieftain’s heart grew young; the letter
<lb/>Astounded him. He sent and called the Iranians,
<lb/>And showed the Shah’s gifts; all that saw them blessed him.
<lb/>He showed the Iranians too all that Hurmuzd
<lb/>Had written of them. The warriors acclaimed;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>‘Earth’s surface shook.</q>
<lb/>He sent too
<lb/>The honourable safe-conduct for Parmuda,
<lb/>Giv’n by the monarch, to the hold to him;
<lb/>His darkened soul grew bright. With many blessings
<lb/>Upon the king he left his famous fortress,
<lb/>And leaving to Bahram Chubina all
<lb/>The wealth therein made ready to depart.
<lb/>Descending from the hold the proud Parmuda
<lb/>Bestrode his charger swift as flying dust,
<pb n="144"/>
<lb/>And set forth with his troops without regard
<lb/>To bold Bahram Chubina who chagrined
<lb/>Thereat, and though his captive was a king,
<lb/>Sent after him and had him brought afoot,
<lb/>And running in the presence of the troops;
<lb/>Then said to him indignantly: <q>Are such
<lb/>Your manners in Turan and Chin—to go
<lb/>Without leave asked of me? Sheer folly this!</q>
<lb/>Parmuda said: <q>Once I was raised o’er folk,
<lb/>But now am humbled and a suppliant,
<lb/>Cast vilely from the zenith of my power.
<lb/>To-day withal thou art not generous
<lb/>In bringing me before thee, evil one!
<lb/>Now that I have the letter of safe-conduct
<lb/>I purpose going to the king. Perchance
<lb/>He will receive me brother-like; misfortune
<lb/>May grow more light to me. What wouldst thou more?
<lb/>I have surrendered fortune, home, and goods.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina raged with flashing eyes
<lb/>In indignation at Parmuda’s words,
<lb/>And struck him in excitement with a whip—
<lb/>Behaviour only fit for miscreants.
<lb/>They bound Parmuda’s feet forthwith and made
<lb/>A scanty tent his prison. Said thereat
<milestone unit="calced" n="1838"/>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin: <q>This paladin
<lb/>And wisdom are not mates!</q>
<lb/>He sought the archscribe,
<lb/>And said: <q>This mighty paladin possesseth
<lb/>Not one gnat’s wing of wisdom!</q> <note>Reading with P.</note> so he taketh
<lb/>No heed of any one, and we must go,
<lb/>And say to him: <q>This is remediless.
<lb/>His temper is his great calamity.</q>
<lb/>The two departed to Bahram Chubina
<lb/>With pallid cheeks and counsel on their tongues,
<pb n="145"/>
<lb/>And told him: <q>Thou hast given to the winds
<lb/>Thy toil! Oh! be that noble head of thine
<lb/>Unfilled with fire!</q>
<lb/>Ware of his foul behaviour,
<lb/>That into water had been flung a brick
<lb/>Already dried, he in his penitence
<lb/>Released the Khan and was in great concern.
<lb/>He sent the Khan a steed with golden trappings,
<lb/>And Indian falchion with a golden scabbard,
<lb/>Moreover went forthwith to him to make
<lb/>His dark soul bright, there tarried till the Khan
<lb/>Had armed and mounted on a speedy steed,
<lb/>And then escorted him upon his way,
<lb/>Perceiving that the prince’s visage loured.
<lb/>When it was time to part Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Told him: <q>Thou hast a secret grudge against me;
<lb/>Yet, though it be so, tell it not the Shah;
<lb/>No credit will result to thee therefrom.</q>
<lb/>The Khan replied to him: <q>It is of fortune
<lb/>That I complain; I leave it all to God.
<lb/>I am not such an one as would desire
<lb/>To speak in many words of other men;
<lb/>Still if thy monarch hath no news hereof
<lb/>He is not worthy of his high estate.
<lb/>It was the turning sky that fettered me;
<lb/>I tell not of ill usage from a slave.</q>
<lb/>Thereat Bahram Chubina paled; he writhed,
<lb/>But with an effort swallowed down his wrath,
<lb/>And thus returned reply: <q>An instance this
<lb/>Of what the famous nobles used to say:—
<lb/><q>Forbear thine utmost seed of ill to cast,
<lb/>For time will give thee fruit thereof at last.</q> <note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>To what end did I deck for thee my heart,
<lb/>Attempt to do thee kindness in the world,
<lb/>And wrote its lord a letter hiding all
<pb n="146"/>
<lb/>Thine own shortcomings?</q> <q>That,</q> the Khan rejoined,
<lb/><q>Is past, and all the past hath turned to wind.
<lb/>By God! I do not owe thee any grudge,
<lb/>Or cherish in my heart the former strife.
<lb/>Thy kindness hath been greater than this wrong,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1839"/>
<lb/>And thou didst guide me on the way to good;
<lb/>But just as there is insolence in war,
<lb/>So is there courtesy in time of peace,
<lb/>And if the two are all the same to thee
<lb/>Thy wisdom out of question is but small,
<lb/>And when a leader is too wise to take
<lb/>His lord’s commands then evil will befall him.
<lb/>Moreover one should tread God’s path and purge
<lb/>All darkness from the heart. 'Twere well for thee
<lb/>To say no more for past ill is but wind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On hearing this Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>Methought 'twould out, but no mishap will come
<lb/>Of thy complaint for I will hide it up
<lb/>With painted silk. On thine arrival say
<lb/>Whate’er thou wilt; 'twill minish not my lustre.</q>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Every king that taketh not
<lb/>Account of good and ill, but passeth over
<lb/>His slave’s misdeeds in silence, be assured
<lb/>Is witless, and when malcontents afar—
<lb/>Allies or other kings—observe this thing
<lb/>They will term thee unseemly and light-headed,
<lb/>And him the foolish monarch of Iran.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina paled, and when Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, had taken note thereof
<lb/>He feared that, wrathful and bloodthirsty man
<lb/>Would hurl Parmuda from his steed to dust,
<lb/>And said: <q>O general of the Shah! repress
<lb/>Thy wrath and quit that path because the Khan
<lb/>Saith well, so list to him and think no ill,
<lb/>For had cool words ne’er passed the hearts of neither
<pb n="147"/>
<lb/>Would have been pained.</q> <q>This ill-conditioned one,</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said, <q>would join his sire.</q>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Wrong me not. Reft as I am
<lb/>Of mine own father I may well die young.
<lb/>All those that in the world are like thyself,
<lb/>With heads all dust-cloud and with hearts all fume,
<lb/>Imagine ill, accord to none, but raise
<lb/>Themselves by craft and cruelty. I fear not
<lb/>The king of kings; from him bale or relief
<lb/>Is well. He is my peer among the great,
<lb/>And not a slave malignantly disposed
<lb/>Towards me, but is gentle, wise, high-born,
<lb/>And greatly mindful of the men of name.
<lb/>I charge thee by the soul and by the head
<lb/>Of Shah Hurmuzd that thou return forthwith.
<lb/>Give me no more replies and insolence;
<lb/>Say naught and hear naught.</q> When Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Heard he returned to camp in vengeful mood,
<lb/>And thus that proven warrior harangued
<lb/>The prudent chiefs: <q>Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>And those wise men, the archscribe and archmages,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1840"/>
<lb/>Shall write a letter to the world’s king, telling
<lb/>All that hath passed in public and in private.</q>
<lb/>The general said further to the chief
<lb/>And other archimages: <q>Men of wisdom!
<lb/>Depart hence to the hold, be diligent,
<lb/>Companion with the wind and ascertain
<lb/>What quantity of wealth is hoarded there.</q>
<lb/>With fearful hearts the scribes set forth. From dawn
<lb/>Until three watches of the night had passed
<lb/>They blacked much paper but they had not done.
<lb/>There was not room to move for precious things,
<pb n="148"/>
<lb/>Hoards of the era of Afrasiyab,
<lb/>And of Arjasp, so ancient yet unspent,
<lb/>Gold coins and jewels won from sea and mine
<lb/>By favour of the sky; such were the treasures
<lb/>Within Awaza hold world-famous then.
<lb/>Among the goods of Siyawush came first
<lb/>A belt with jewelled buckles and such earrings
<lb/>As no one high or low besides possessed,
<lb/>Which Kai Khusrau had given Luhrasp and he
<lb/>Thereafter gave them to Gushtasp. Arjasp
<lb/>Gat them and stored them there, none knoweth when.
<lb/>They wrote a list of all the precious things
<lb/>That were laid up within the treasury,
<lb/>But no one in the world, astrologer,
<lb/>Or noble prince had knowledge of the sum.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina sent a scribe, a man
<lb/>Shrewd, eloquent, and mindful, who collected
<lb/>The booty from the hold and battlefield.
<lb/>There were a pair of earrings in the spoil,
<lb/>And pair of boots with patterns formed by gems;
<lb/>The stuff was interwoven with gold threads
<lb/>Bestrung with precious stones. There were withal
<lb/>Two gold-embroidered curtains from Yaman,
<lb/>Whereof each one was seven mans in weight.
<lb/>Now through presumption and perversity
<lb/>The captain of the host, contemplating
<lb/>No scrutiny, put secretly aside
<lb/>The pairs of boots and curtains of Yaman,
<lb/>And made no entry of them in his list.
<lb/>He then gave orders to Izid Gashasp
<lb/>That he and all his cavaliers should mount,
<lb/>Select a thousand warriors from the host,
<lb/>And take the booty to the monarch’s gate.
<lb/>The warriors having mounted on their steeds,
<pb n="149"/>
<lb/>Izid Gashasp bore off that mass of spoil,
<lb/>And full of joy and merriment they took
<lb/>A hundred caravan-loads to Iran.
<lb/>Iranian horsemen closed the long array,
<lb/>The Khan with his own nobles led the way.

How Parmida came before Hurmuzd with the
Treasures sent by Bahram Chubina</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1841"/>
<lb/>With treasure, gifts, and troops the Khan drew near
<lb/>The monarch of the world who heard and mounted
<lb/>With crown on head and mace in hand, and thus
<lb/>Came to the gate. When from the porch he saw
<lb/>The visage of the Khan he paused to note
<lb/>If at the sight of him that prince and troops
<lb/>Would light down from their steeds. Parmuda watched,
<lb/>Full of concern, if he would turn away,
<lb/>Then, mounted still, came with the archimage,
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, whereat the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Bestirred him with his troops. The Khan alighted
<lb/>And hastened toward the Shah, without delay
<lb/>Remounting his black Arab, while the Great King
<lb/>Abode not with Parmiuda in the porch,
<lb/>And rode his fleet steed off; but when the Khan
<lb/>Was following, the keeper of the curtain
<lb/>Laid hold upon his reins forthwith. Parmuda
<lb/>Alighted instantly and manifested
<lb/>His own diplomacy by that submission.
<lb/>Now when the Khan approached the royal throne
<lb/>The king of kings received him with all favour,
<lb/>And having welcomed set him in the presence,
<lb/>Repenting of the past hostility.
<lb/>They lodged him fitly in the pleasant palace
<pb n="150"/>
<lb/>Prepared for him and brought whate’er he needed.
<lb/>A scribe was charged to lodge the retinue
<lb/>Hard by. The Shah, on hearing of the wealth
<lb/>Brought by Parmida, sent it to the park,
<lb/>And charged therewith the keeper of the camels.
<lb/>The eighth day, when Parmiuda was refreshed
<lb/>From all his toils, the Shah ordained a feast,
<lb/>And, when the Khan was seated at the board
<lb/>At court and in the presence of the world-lord,
<lb/>Bade bring the camel-loads before the chiefs.
<lb/>One counted up the porters; on that day
<lb/>There were ten thousand hired. The next, at dawn,
<lb/>Hurmuzd had wine set forth and took his seat,
<lb/>And from the park came fifty thousand bales
<lb/>As well as parcels on the porters’ backs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1842"/>
<lb/>The baggage filled a hundred treasuries.
<lb/>The Shah, when his task was achieved, bade bring
<lb/>Before the presence publicly a bale
<lb/>Of stuffs, bejewelled earrings, and a girdle
<lb/>Compact, thou wouldst have said, of gold and gems.
<lb/>These he bestowed with many words of praise
<lb/>Upon the messenger who kissed the ground,
<lb/>While from the banquet-hall arose acclaim:—
<lb/>“Victorious be the Shah.”
<lb/>He at that time
<lb/>Said to his confidant Izid Gashasp<note>Perhaps we ought to read “Ayin Gashasp" here and below. See pp. 75, 174 seq.</note>
<lb/>:—
<lb/><q>What seest thou in Bahram Chubina’s exploit?
<lb/>He maketh war to cease right manfully.</q>
<lb/>The scribe Izid Gashasp replied: <q>O Shah,
<lb/>Who art observant and of ardent mind!
<lb/>When at a feast the theme is such know there
<lb/>Will likewise be but ill-conditioned fare.’</q> <note>With changes of reading Mohl translates: <cit><quote xml:lang="fra">sache que les mets d'une féte ou c’est Ie mot corneille (djoubin) qui forme le refrain doivent étre étranges.</quote> <bibl>Mohl</bibl></cit></note>
<pb n="151"/>
<lb/>The Shah became suspiciously inclined
<lb/>On hearing this; misdoubtings filled his mind.

<div><head>§ 19
How Hurmuzd heard of the Ill-doing of Bahram
Chubina and made a Compact with the Khan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Then came a lusty camel-post and brought
<lb/>This letter from the archscribe: <q>May the world-lord
<lb/>Be ever joyful and his head and crown
<lb/>For ever present in his servant’s thoughts.
<lb/>Know that there were two curtains of Yaman
<lb/>Among the spoil, boots decked with gems uncut,
<lb/>The earrings too of noble Siyawush,
<lb/>Who left us wisdom as his monument,
<lb/>And these the paladin bare off with him</q> <note>Reading with P.</note> 
<lb/>No marvel since he underwent the toil.
<lb/>Hurmuzd said to Parmida: <q>Tell me all
<lb/>That thou didst see hereof.</q>
<lb/>The fallen king
<lb/>Confirmed the scribe’s report. The haughty Shah
<lb/>Was wroth thereat and said: <q>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Doth err, uplifting to the moon his head.
<lb/>For one thing he hath struck the Khan of Chin—
<lb/>An act the outcome of an evil nature—
<lb/>And then would nothing but these earrings serve
<lb/>His turn? Perhaps he hath become a king.
<lb/>His toil hath turned to wind and all his knowledge
<lb/>And justice have become corrupt.</q> This said,
<lb/>He called the Khan and having seated him
<lb/>Upon the famous throne they feasted there
<pb n="152"/>
<lb/>Till night spread out her musky tresses black.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1843"/>
<lb/>Then said the Shah: <q>If thou wilt league with me
<lb/>Thou shalt partake my honey.</q> As he sat
<lb/>He grasped the Khan‘s hand, and Parmida marvelled.
<lb/>The Shah proceeded: <q>Swear to me afresh,
<lb/>And make a new departure, not to break
<lb/>With me or with the nobles of this folk
<lb/>On thy return.</q> Parmida swore forthwith:—
<lb/><q>By shining daylight and night azure-dim,
<lb/>By God who hath of right supremacy,
<lb/>The Artificer of Jupiter and Venus,
<lb/>The great Shah’s crown and throne, Azargashasp,
<lb/>The signet and the diadem, the Khan
<lb/>Shall not grow alien from the Shah in heart,
<lb/>And vex him not in aught.</q> This sworn, they rose
<lb/>And sought their couches.
<lb/>When the yellow sun
<lb/>O’er-topped the mountains, and the kings awoke,
<lb/>The noble Shah prepared a present—ware
<lb/>Of gold and silver, horses, coronets,
<lb/>Of girdles gemmed and golden, armlets, torques,
<lb/>And earrings, Arab steeds with golden trappings,
<lb/>And Indian scimitars with golden sheaths,
<lb/>Dispatched them to the Khan, consorted with him
<lb/>Two stages and the more part of the third,
<lb/>And having bidden him farewell returned.
<lb/>The paladin, on hearing of the gifts
<lb/>Presented by the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And how the Khan was coming back rejoicing,
<lb/>Rode forth to meet him with the Iranian chiefs.
<lb/>He stored provisions where the Khan would pass
<lb/>In town and village, station, hill, and plain,
<pb n="153"/>
<lb/>And hurried on in shame at his ill temper
<lb/>To make excuse in person. When he saw
<lb/>Parmida he did reverence but the Khan
<lb/>Proved wholly adverse, would accept of naught
<lb/>That he had brought of provand, purse, or slave,
<lb/>And on the way ignored him utterly.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina fared three stages thus,
<lb/>And not once did Parmida call for him.
<lb/>Upon the fourth the Khan sent one to say:—
<lb/><q>Return for thou hast toiled enough.</q>
<lb/>Thereat
<lb/>Bahram Chubina left him and in wrath
<lb/>Set face toward Balkh where he abode in dudgeon,
<lb/>Repenting of his acts with aching heart.
<lb/>Withal the world-lord was displeased with him,
<lb/>And fumes of anger filled the monarch’s soul
<milestone unit="calced" n="1844"/>
<lb/>First at that outrage to the Khan wherein
<lb/>Bahram Chubina had done shamefully.
<lb/>And next that he had dared to lay his hand
<lb/>On certain of the spoil without command.

How Hurmuzd wrote a chiding Letter to Bahram
Chubina and sent him a Distaff-case, Cotton, and

<p>
<lb/>The king then wrote thus to Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/><q>Unconscionable div! perceiv’st thou not
<lb/>That all our excellencies are from God,
<lb/>And yet thou sittest on the vault of heaven?
<lb/>Hast thou forgot my pains, troops, toil, and treasure?
<lb/>Thou keepest not the way of paladins,
<pb n="154"/>
<lb/>But raisest thy head skyward. Thou hast turned
<lb/>From my behest and acted otherwise.
<lb/>Here is the robe of honour meet for thee,
<lb/>Agreeable and appropriate to thine acts.</q>
<lb/>The Shah, when he had sealed this, ordered one
<lb/>To bring him a black distaff-case with distaff
<lb/>And cotton, much unworthy gear, withal
<lb/>A blue silk shift, red drawers, and yellow coif,
<lb/>Chose an ignoble messenger to match
<lb/>With that unseemly gift and said: <q>Convey
<lb/>These to Bahram Chubina. Say to him:—
<lb/>'O worthless miscreant! thou didst bind the Khan,
<lb/>And gloat upon great men’s mishaps, but I
<lb/>Will fetch thee from thy seat and hold thee naught
<lb/>Henceforth.'</q>
<lb/>The messenger, these words in mind,
<lb/>Departed with the gift and went like wind.

<lb/>Sent with the letter he endured in silence.
<lb/>He thought: <q>This is my guerdon! So the Shah
<lb/>Is now my foe though he hath not devised
<lb/>This wrong but mine ill-wishers slandered me.
<lb/>The world-lord is the master of his slaves,
<lb/>And if he putteth me to shame 'tis well.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1845"/>
<lb/>I did not think that enemies of mine
<lb/>Had access to the Shah. Since I left court
<lb/>In haste with but few troops all men have witnessed
<lb/>My deeds, my sorrows and my toils and hardships.
<pb n="155"/>
<lb/>If these toils are rewarded by a shame
<lb/>That is the portion of the infamous
<lb/>I will complain of circling heaven to God
<lb/>For having docked me thus of all its love.</q>
<lb/>He called upon the Judge that giveth good,
<lb/>Then, having donned the red and yellow garb,
<lb/>And set before him the black spindle-case,
<lb/>And all the other things sent by the Shah,
<lb/>He summoned to him all the mighty men,
<lb/>The nobles of the monarch of the world.
<lb/>These came forth from the army to the chief,
<lb/>Whose gloomy soul was full of anxious thoughts.
<lb/>They came, both young and old, were all astound,
<lb/>And mused, on seeing their paladin so clad.
<lb/>He said: <q>A robe of honour from the Shah!
<lb/>Ye saw and heard of what I did and how
<lb/>I combated with my two-headed dart.
<lb/>The Shah despaired about the royal throne;
<lb/>The world was dark and I illumined it.
<lb/>I have put on me this repugnant garb
<lb/>According to the exalted king’s command.
<lb/>The Shah is world-lord and we are his slaves,
<lb/>Our hearts and souls are full of love for him.
<lb/>What are your views, ye witnesses! herein?
<lb/>What answer make we to the king of earth?</q>
<lb/>All cried: <q>Famed paladin and worshipful!
<lb/>If this be thy worth with the Shah the troops
<lb/>Are dogs at court! Note what the ancient sage
<lb/>Observed at Rai when angry with Ardshir:—
<lb/>'I grow averse from archmage and Shah’s throne
<lb/>When he regardeth not my weal and woe.'
<lb/>How canst thou seek for honour from a man
<lb/>That honoureth not thee?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>Forbear:
<lb/>The Shah is source of honour to his troops;
<lb/>His slaves are we; he giveth, we receive.</q>
<pb n="156"/>
<lb/>The Iranians said: <q>We will not arm henceforth;
<lb/>We will not have him in Iran as Shah,
<lb/>Or, as our general, Bahram Chubina.</q>
<lb/>They spake and went forth from his presence, left
<lb/>The palace of the chieftain<note>Reading with P.</note> for the plain,
<lb/>But he refrained his lips and at the most
<lb/>Gave only prudent counsels to the host.

How Bahram Chubina went to hunt and saw a Lady who foretold the Future to him</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1846"/>
<lb/>Two weeks passed, then Bahram Chubina left
<lb/>His palace for the waste. In front of him
<lb/>There was a forest furnished well with trees—
<lb/>The very place for lucky revellers.
<lb/>Upon the mead he saw an onager,
<lb/>And none will see a fairer one. He followed
<lb/>At leisure, heating not his steed. Appeared
<lb/>Within that woodland-chase a narrow path,
<lb/>Which when that gallant onager had traversed
<lb/>A pleasance next was seen upon the plain.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, marking this, proceeded
<lb/>Until a splendid palace came in sight.
<lb/>Led by the onager he turned and rode
<lb/>Thereto; behind him was Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>To whom he gave his fleet steed’s reins and said:—
<lb/><q>May wisdom ever be thy mate,</q> then entered
<lb/>The porch alone. Izid Gashasp the while
<lb/>Abode without and held the noble steed.
<lb/>Behind him hurrying came Yalan-sina
<pb n="157"/>
<lb/>Armed on a swift horse. Brave Izid Gashasp
<lb/>Said: <q>Lion! enter thou and find out whither
<lb/>Our chief, the heroic captain of the host,
<lb/>Our succourer, hath gone.</q>
<lb/>Yalan-sina
<lb/>Made for the palace with an anxious heart
<lb/>To seek the chief. He saw it and its hall
<lb/>Magnifical; its like he had not seen
<lb/>Or heard of in Iran. Upon one side
<lb/>Thereof there was a cupola whose top
<lb/>Was viewless through its height and under it
<lb/>A throne of gold with steps begemmed. The throne
<lb/>Was covered with brocade of Rum in patterns
<lb/>Picked out with jewels on a ground of gold.
<lb/>Upon the throne there sat a lady crowned,
<lb/>Of cypress-height and with a face like Spring. <note>Three couplets omitted.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1847"/>
<lb/>Beside it was a seat and thereupon
<lb/>The captain of the host while many slaves,
<lb/>Idols fay-faced and blooming, were around.
<lb/>On seeing Yalan-sina the lady bade
<lb/>A handmaid: <q>Hasten to yon lion-heart,
<lb/>Fair mate, and say: 'Thou mayst not enter here.
<lb/>Stay with thy comrades. He will come anon,
<lb/>But go thou first. As from Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Speak this and ease them as to his return.'</q>
<lb/>She sent some also to his retinue
<lb/>To bring the warriors’ horses to the stalls,
<lb/>And take good care of all their equipage.
<lb/>The gardener unlocked the garden-gate
<lb/>By hest of that fair hostess, <note>Couplet omitted.</note> and they set
<lb/>About the garden victuals past conceit.
<lb/>Whenas the warriors had eaten bread
<lb/>They led the chargers to the place assigned.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, when he left the lady,
<lb/>Spake thus: <q>May Jupiter espouse thy crown.</q>
<pb n="158"/>
<lb/>She answered: <q>Be victorious and ever
<lb/>Of patient heart and wise.</q> <note>Couplet omitted.</note> <q>Go thou! the throne
<lb/>And the Iranian diadem are thine.
<lb/>The world shall be set straight by thee, so win it
<lb/>By might and sword from dark dust to the stars.</q> <note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>Now when he came forth from that garth of roses
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>He weepeth blood!</q>
<lb/>So changed
<lb/>Was he in temper and in talk that thou
<lb/>Hadst said: <q>He raiseth to the Pleiades
<lb/>His head.</q> Anon the onager appeared;
<lb/>The chieftain followed after on his steed,
<lb/>And it was so that till he cleared the forest
<lb/>The onager still served him as a guide.
<lb/>He went back to the city from the chase,
<lb/>But spake not of the matter to the host.
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, regarded him
<lb/>And said thus: <q>O thou chief that speakest sooth!
<lb/>What was this marvel seen and heard by none
<lb/>That happened in the chase?</q>
<lb/>The paladin
<lb/>Vouchsafed no answer but in dudgeon sought
<lb/>The palace, and none else dared ask: <q>What might
<lb/>This matter mean, this vision of delight?</q>
</p>

How Bahram Chubina assumed the royal Style and how Kharrad, Son of Barzin, and the Archscribe<note>Izid Gashasp in the original. Cf. p. 106.</note> fled</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1848"/>
<lb/>The next day, when the uplands silvered over,
<lb/>And when yon yellow shining Lamp appeared,
<pb n="159"/>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina spread a carpeting
<lb/>Made of brocade of Chin, and thou hadst said
<lb/>That earth had turned to sky. Throughout the palace
<lb/>He ranged gold seats and cushions of brocade
<lb/>Of gold. They placed a golden ante-throne
<lb/>Whereon the captain of the host sat down,
<lb/>Then held a session like the king of kings,
<lb/>And placed upon his head the crown of greatness.
<lb/>The archscribe marked Bahram Chubina’s conduct,
<lb/>And, knowing him to be both bold and strong,
<lb/>Went and retailed his knowledge, sight or hearsay,
<lb/>Before Kharrad, son of Barzin, who listened,
<lb/>Knew that his own toils had been vain, and said:—
<lb/><q>Take not this lightly, O thou noble scribe!
<lb/>This king of kings of ours hath played the fool
<lb/>In sending as a gift the distaff-case,
<lb/>Not knowing that this battle-loving Lion
<lb/>Would thus revolt. We must not talk of this,
<lb/>But when 'tis midnight fare forth to the Shah,
<lb/>And say: "Bahram Chubina’s heart is set
<lb/>Upon the crown; the seat too under him
<lb/>Is ivory."</q>
<lb/>They canvassed all the case,
<lb/>And made a shift to flee, prepared the pretext,
<lb/>And fled from Balkh by night. The chief, informed
<lb/>Thereof, and knowing well their clear, shrewd minds,
<lb/>Said to Yalan-sina: <q>Go in pursuit
<lb/>Of those two dotards with a hundred horse.</q>
<lb/>He overtook the archscribe, raged at him,
<lb/>As 'twere a wolf, took from him all he had,
<lb/>And brought him back made fast in heavy bonds,
<lb/>Back to Bahram Chubina so that he
<lb/>Might slay the innocent. The paladin
<lb/>Said: <q>Doer of div’s work! why didst thou quit me
<pb n="160"/>
<lb/>Without my leave?</q> <q>O paladin!</q> he answered,
<lb/><q>Kharrad, son of Barzin, made me afraid.
<lb/>He said: 'We may not tarry; thy delay
<lb/>Will please those only that speak ill of thee,
<lb/>For when the heroic captain of the host,
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, holdeth court as Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1849"/>
<lb/>There is a fear lest thou and I be slain
<lb/>Save we return.'</q> Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>Just so: one must consult o’er good and ill.</q>
<lb/>He then restored and with advantages
<lb/>From his own treasures what the scribe had lost,
<lb/>Then said to him: <q>Go thou and ponder o’er
<lb/>Thy conduct in this case and flee no more.</q>

<div><head>§ 24
How Hurmuz received News of Bahram Chubina’s
Doings, and how Bahram Chubina sent a Frail of Swords to Hurmuz</head>
<p>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, for his part rode,
<lb/>Escaping notice, till he reached the Shah,
<lb/>To whom he told his news, suppressing naught,
<lb/>Of wood and meadow, course of onager,
<lb/>Strait pathway and Bahram Chubina’s sojourn;
<lb/>Told of the palace and the jewelled throne,
<lb/>The slave-girls and the lady with the crown:
<lb/>He told whatever he had seen and heard.
<lb/>The Shah mused at the tale, laid it to heart,
<lb/>And sighed as he remembered what the archmage
<lb/>And fortune-teller had said: "<q>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Will turn him from thy throne.</q>"<note n="1">See pp. 107, 108.</note>
<pb n="161"/>
<lb/>Forthwith he summoned
<lb/>The high priest, set Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Within the room and said to him: "<q>Relate
<lb/>The adventures of thy journey.</q>"
<lb/>Thus enjoined
<lb/>He oped his lips and told it all. The Shah
<lb/>Said to the high priest: "<q>What importeth this?
<lb/>We must consult at large. The onager
<lb/>That led him through the wood, the palace seen
<lb/>Amidst the wilderness, the lady crowned
<lb/>Upon the golden throne, the slaves in waiting
<lb/>As on a queen—the account is like a dream
<lb/>Suggested by old tales!</q>"
<lb/>The high priest thus
<lb/>Made answer to the monarch of the world:—
<lb/>"<q>Beneath that onager there was a div
<lb/>Who sought to lead Bahram Chubina wrong,
<lb/>And make perverseness show within his heart.
<lb/>The palace, be assured, was sorcerer’s work,
<lb/>The lady on the throne an impious witch,
<lb/>Who on this wise to hearten him the more
<lb/>Displayed the crown and throne of majesty.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1850"/>
<lb/>All eager and bemused he went from her:
<lb/>Be sure that he will ne’er come back to hand.
<lb/>His heart was wounded by thy distaff-case,
<lb/>And going to that div-witch made it worse.
<lb/>It was not well to send the ignoble robe
<lb/>To one so overweening, for thereby
<lb/>The Iranians were estranged and ceased to trust
<lb/>The king of kings. So now devise a scheme
<lb/>To bring the army back to court from Balkh.</q>"
<lb/>The king repented having acted so
<lb/>About the cotton and the gaudy dress,
<lb/>And asked Kharrad, son of Barzin: "<q>What say
<lb/>The troops there of that lady?</q>"
<lb/>He replied:—
<pb n="162"/>
<lb/>"<q>As for that crownéd lady, all the troops
<lb/>Call her, O king! 'Bahram Chubina’s Luck,'
<lb/>Which will be very great and glorious.</q>"
<lb/>The king, on hearing, greatly feared the ills
<lb/>That fortune had in store. Ere long there came
<lb/>One from the paladin, the cavalier,
<lb/>And brought a frail of swords with points all bent.<note n="2"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">par usage qu'on en avait fait dans la bataille.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>He set them down before the Shah who looked
<lb/>Upon that iron gear, bade break the swords,
<lb/>Replace them in that ill-conditioned frail,
<lb/>And then return them to Bahram Chubina:
<lb/>No word was spoken but the intent was clear.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina oped the frail, beheld
<lb/>The long swords snapped at point and then replaced,
<lb/>And, wayward as he was, grew full of thought.
<lb/>He called the Iranians round the frail and said:—
<lb/>"<q>Behold the king’s gift! Underrate it not.
<lb/>It meaneth that this host is little worth,
<lb/>And not the head of one of us will scape.</q>"
<lb/>The troops thought much of what the Shah had done,
<lb/>And of their paladin’s address. They said:—
<lb/>"<q>One day our monarch sendeth us as gifts
<lb/>A distaff and a gaudy robe; anon
<lb/>He giveth broken swords—a present worse
<lb/>Than striking or abuse. Ne’er be such Shah
<lb/>Upon the throne! May none remember him,
<lb/>And if again the offspring of Gashasp—
<lb/>Bahram Chubina—ride on that court’s dust
<lb/>Then may they perish, skin and marrow both,
<lb/>He and his worthless sire!</q>"
<lb/>The chieftain heard,
<lb/>Saw how Hurmuz had vexed the host and said:—
<lb/>"<q>Be vigilant and let your minds be clear
<milestone unit="calced" n="1850"/>
<lb/>Because Kharrad, son of Barzin, hath told
<pb n="163"/>
<lb/>Our secrets to the king. Let each consult
<lb/>His safety and conspire with me to-day.
<lb/>If I send none to watch our enemies
<lb/>Regard my days as done, my soldiers slain.</q>"
<lb/>He spake and took new order: mark and muse.
<lb/>He scattered horsemen through the realm lest letters,
<lb/>Sent by the king, should reach the Iranians,
<lb/>And they should arm themselves to fight for him,
<lb/>And so it was that till a time had gone
<lb/>A royal letter was perused by none.

<div><head>§ 25
How Bahram Chubina made known to the Chiefs his
Designs upon the Throne, and how his Sister
Gurdya advised him</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina summoned then the chiefs,
<lb/>And told them many secrets. There were present
<lb/>Hamdan Gashasp and the archscribe, Yalan-sina,
<lb/>Renowned and strong, with valorous Bahram,
<lb/>The son of Siyawush, and that wise chief,
<lb/>Kanda Gashasp. With these he held debate,
<lb/>For they were Lions and men of war, and then
<lb/>Harangued that fierce host, which was all astray,
<lb/>Thus: "<q>Famous chiefs whose counsel all require!
<lb/>The Shah is wroth with us without a cause,
<lb/>And so hath turned away from what is right.
<lb/>What will ye do? What is the remedy?
<lb/>‘Tis useless to shed tears upon the past.
<lb/>Whoe’er hath hid his anguish from the leech
<lb/>Hath showered from his lashes tears of blood,
<lb/>And trifles grow in moment when we keep
<lb/>Our secrets from the men of understanding.
<pb n="164"/>
<lb/>I have myself my privy griefs and I
<lb/>Will tell them to the sages of the world.
<lb/>Ye all are conversant with these affairs,
<lb/>And so can testify to what I say.
<lb/>We left Iran by order of the Shah
<lb/>With but few troops, though eager to engage,
<lb/>And none, though long his life, will see a foe
<lb/>More numerous. Now if the Turk Parmuda,
<lb/>Had, with king Sawa, marched upon Iran
<lb/>It would not have been worth a piece of wax,
<lb/>And later they would have attempted Rum;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1852"/>
<lb/>But on Parmuda and king Sawa came
<lb/>A marvel such as none within the world
<lb/>Had seen, and though we bore much toil ourselves
<lb/>We left them neither elephants nor treasure.
<lb/>The Shah hath laid up wealth anew, grown rich,
<lb/>And yet he is enraged against the host
<lb/>Though all the business hath been done for him,
<lb/>And he is franchised through no toil of his!<note>Couplet transposed.</note>
<lb/>In such a coil what shift shall I employ
<lb/>To set my head at ease? Do ye too all
<lb/>Shift for yourselves. What is your remedy
<lb/>For such a wound? I have discharged my heart,
<lb/>And freed my soul. Respecting weal or woe
<lb/>If ye are ware of any means now speak.</q>"
<lb/>He proved with these words, for he feared, the host.
<lb/>Behind his curtains that famed paladin
<lb/>Possessed a sister, one of ardent soul,
<lb/>And that wise lady’s name was Gurdya,
<lb/>Of fairy-visage and his heart’s delight.
<lb/>Now she, on hearing from behind the veil
<lb/>Her brother’s words, was angered; her heart flared.
<lb/>With much to say and full of instances
<lb/>She came forth to that conclave, and her brother
<lb/>Kept silence, when he heard her voice, from word
<pb n="165"/>
<lb/>And answer, and the Iranians too were silent
<lb/>For fear of harm. Thus Gurdya addressed
<lb/>The troops: "<q>Illustrious men who seek for guidance!
<lb/>Why do ye hold your peace and check your spleen?
<lb/>Ye are the warrior-chieftains of Iran,
<lb/>Wise, prescient lords. What see ye in this matter?
<lb/>What game play ye upon this scene of blood?</q>"
<lb/>Then said Izid Gashasp, the cavalier:—
<lb/>"<q>Memorial of the mighty! were our tongues
<lb/>Sharp swords they would take flight before the sea
<lb/>Of thine advice. Thine acts are all of God,
<lb/>Brave, learned, and wise. We need not fight like
<lb/>And cavalierly counter cavaliers,
<lb/>While if the paladin is pleased with me
<lb/>Methinketh that I shall be young for ever.</q>"
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing him thus speak,
<lb/>Saw that he dealt with both sides. Then he marked
<lb/>Yalan-sina and said: "<q>What thinkest thou?</q>"
<milestone unit="calced" n="1853"/>
<lb/>Quoth he: "<q>Brave chief! the walker in God’s way
<lb/>Will be wise, famed, and learned, will have his will
<lb/>In all and, winning victory and grace,
<lb/>Will haste not to do ill for that would turn
<lb/>A blessing to a curse and circling heaven
<lb/>Be vengeful towards him. God hath given thee
<lb/>Grace, fortune, troops withal, wealth, prowess, throne;
<lb/>If thou art grateful He will send thee more,
<lb/>But through ingratitude the heart will ache.</q>"
<lb/>Then said Bahram Chubina to Bahram—
<lb/>"<q>Wise friend and prudent mate! what sayest thou
<lb/>About this seeking after throne and treasure?
<lb/>Will majesty result or pain and grief?</q>"
<lb/>He laughed that such a case should be discussed,
<pb n="166"/>
<lb/>Then tossing up his finger-ring replied:—
<lb/>"<q>As long as this remaineth in the air
<lb/>So long shall it be servant to the Shah;
<lb/>Yet he is great; despise him not for none
<lb/>Should under-estimate the diadem.</q>"
<lb/>Said to Kanda Gashasp<note>Reading with P. C. has Izid Gashasp</note> Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/>"<q>O thou sword-wielding and steed-spurring Lion!
<lb/>What seest and sayst thou touching this affair
<lb/>Of ours? Do we deserve the royal throne?</q>"
<lb/>That cavalier replied: "<q>O thou that art
<lb/>The memory of heroes in the world!
<lb/>There was an archimage at Rai who said:—
<lb/>‘The wise and lucky man to whom ’tis given
<lb/>Once to be king his soul will soar to heaven.’
<lb/>So aiming at the treasure of the king
<lb/>Is better than to be long years a slave.</q>"
<lb/>Then to the archscribe said Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/>"<q>Old wolf! unclose thy lips.</q>"
<lb/>The archscribe kept
<lb/>His lips still shut awhile and sat amid
<lb/>A crowd of thoughts, then said: "<q>Whoe’er shall seek
<lb/>His wish in fitting fashion will attain it,
<lb/>For time’s stretched hand is long. Know that no pains
<lb/>Can shun whatever God will have to be.</q>"
<lb/>Then said the chieftain to Hamdan Gashasp:—
<lb/>"<q>O thou well versed in fortune’s rise and fall!
<lb/>Whatever thou shalt utter in our presence
<lb/>Shall be as wind and, like wind, hurt thee not.
<lb/>Advise us in this case, this test of good
<lb/>And evil fortune.</q>"
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Great Hamdan Gashasp
<lb/>Thus spake: "<q>Prized by the great! why dost thou dread
<lb/>Ills not yet come and question of the crown
<pb n="167"/>
<lb/>Of kingship? Act and leave the rest to God.
<lb/>Why reach out for the date if thou dost fear
<milestone unit="calced" n="1854"/>
<lb/>The thorn? A people’s Head hath never rest;
<lb/>His mind is fearful and his body weary.</q>"
<lb/>The sister of the captain of the host
<lb/>Writhed at their words and grew o’ercast of soul,
<lb/>Yet spake she naught in this debate from eve
<lb/>Till midnight. Then Bahram Chubina said:
<lb/>"<q>What thinkest thou of this assembly’s words,
<lb/>Fair lady?</q>"
<lb/>Gurdya made no reply;
<lb/>The counsels of the chief displeasured her.
<lb/>Thereafter she addressed the archscribe thus:
<lb/>"<q>O man maleficent like some old wolf!
<lb/>So thou conceivest that the crown and throne,
<lb/>Host and addition and the might of fortune
<lb/>Were in the world no objects of desire
<lb/>To any famous chiefs of generous bent
<lb/>Though kingship easier is than servitude!
<lb/>Such sentiments as thine demand our tears.
<lb/>Take we the precedents of former Shahs,
<lb/>And hear the sayings of those greater ones.</q>"
<lb/>The archscribe made response: "<q>If rede of mine
<lb/>Obtain not with thee, speak and do whatever
<lb/>Thou art advised and follow thy heart’s lead.</q>"
<lb/>Then likewise to self-willed Bahram Chubina
<lb/>His sister spake and said: "<q>They are not good,
<lb/>Thy knowledge and thy counsel, and thy steps
<lb/>Are tending toward deceit. Full many a time
<lb/>Hath the Shah’s throne been void and yet no chief
<lb/>Cast any look upon it. It was theirs
<lb/>To guard the world by valour, not to have
<lb/>An eye upon the throne. They did not aim
<lb/>Thereat but girt their loins to serve. They sought
<lb/>Their sovereigns’ weal and rendered hearty service.
<lb/>They were no strangers to the throne and crown,
<pb n="168"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1855"/>
<lb/>But worthy of their greatness by descent.</q>"
<lb/>I speak first of the case of Shah Kaus,<note>See Vol. ii. p. 102 seq.</note>
<lb/>Who would have searched the mysteries of God,
<lb/>Have summed the stars and trod heaven’s circling dome,
<lb/>But fell despised and wretched at Sarf
<lb/>Through his perverseness and ill bent, and yet
<lb/>Gudarz and Rustam, who was paladin,
<lb/>Did not take dudgeon, and thereafter when
<lb/>Kaus went to Hamavaran,<note>Id. p. 82 seq.</note> and folk
<lb/>Bound him in heavy fetters, none essayed
<lb/>The throne but manifested warm regret.
<lb/>So when the Iranians said to Rustam: ‘Thou
<lb/>Art worthy of the throne,’<note>Cf. Id. p. 143.</note> he cried against
<lb/>The speaker: '<q>Be thy mate the narrow charnel!
<lb/>Shall I be on the throne of gold, the Shah
<lb/>Bound? Perish kingship rather! Perish crown!</q>'
<milestone unit="calced" n="1855"/>
<lb/>He chose out of Iran twelve thousand men,<note>Cf. p. 104 and note.</note>
<lb/>World-taking cavaliers on barded steeds,
<lb/>And freed Kaus and Giv, Gudarz and Tus,
<lb/>From that captivity. Then when Piruz
<lb/>Was slain and for the Iranians all was lost,<note>See Vol. vii, p. 167 seq.</note>
<lb/>While Khushnawaz emboldened by affairs
<lb/>Was seated on the alluring throne in peace,
<lb/>Came Sufrayai, the scion of Karan,
<lb/>In order to restore the throne of power.
<lb/>When his success was manifest the nobles
<lb/>Went from Iran to hail him as their Shah,
<lb/>And make a subject monarch of the earth.
<lb/>He told them: '<q>‘Tis unseemly. Majesty
<lb/>And crown are for the Shah. Although Kubad
<lb/>Is little he will grow; we may not put
<lb/>The wolf within the lion’s wood. To make
<pb n="169"/>
<lb/>A Shah without blood royal is to give
<lb/>His kindred to the winds.</q> Now when Kubad
<lb/>Reached manhood he perceived that Sufrayai
<lb/>Deserved the crown and, led by miscreants’ words,
<lb/>Slew him who was the backbone of the state.
<lb/>The folk thereafter put Kubad in fetters,
<lb/>That horseman bold, that hero of the race
<lb/>Of kings, and gave him to Zarmihr, the low-born,
<lb/>That he might take revenge for his own sire.
<lb/>Zarmihr saw none else worthy of the crown
<lb/>And throne of kingship, so he freed Kubad
<lb/>In order that he might assert his claim
<lb/>Without delay. No subject dared aspire
<lb/>Though many were entitled by their birth.
<lb/>When from the Turks one hight 'King Sawa' came
<lb/>To seek the seal and crown the glorious Maker
<lb/>Ordained that he should perish in Iran.

<lb/>Whenas the rising sun shot forth its beams,

<lb/>"<q>For grief, while asking pardon for mine acts,

<lb/>Henceforth I will not hurt thy country, land,
<lb/>Or marches through regard for thee; and I,
<lb/>If I become the monarch of the world,

<lb/>Take not to heart the past for God forgiveth
<lb/>His slave. A thousand blessings on thy helm,

<lb/>He spake much to the same effect. The envoy
<lb/>Was in amaze at him, then trod earth’s face,
<lb/>And bore the message to the Khan of Chin
<milestone unit="calced" n="1858"/>
<lb/>By whom a gracious answer was returned:—
<lb/>"<q>I for my part term thee magnanimous.</q>"
<pb n="173"/>
<lb/>He sent Bahram Chubina gifts that cheered
<lb/>The heart.
<lb/>This matter done, Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Formed other plans, unlocked his hoarded treasures,
<lb/>Gave his troops drachms, steeds, slaves, and privily
<lb/>Aimed at the seat of sovereignty. He chose
<lb/>Among the host a paladin, one fit
<lb/>To be the prince of Khurasan, bestowed
<lb/>That land on him with Nishapur and Balkh,
<lb/>Marv and Herat, and troops withal, then went,
<lb/>From Balkh to Rai, full of solicitude,
<lb/>Upon the glorious Khurdad of Da;
<lb/>Took thought of great and small, then bade his men
<lb/>Set up a mint and issue coins that bore
<lb/>The superscription of Khusrau Parwiz.
<lb/>He gave to merchants shrewd and plausible
<lb/>Of speech, and fitted for the ticklish task,
<lb/>Sacks of these new-coined drachms and said: ‘Buy up
<lb/>Whatever ye can get in Tisfun
<lb/>Of costly Rum brocade with silken figures
<lb/>Upon a ground of gold.’
<lb/>He meant to bring
<lb/>That coinage to the notice of the king.
</p>
<p>§ 27
<lb/>Bahram Chubina chose a prudent envoy,
<lb/>Strong as the blest Surush.<note>The previous section ends here in the original.</note> He wrote withal
<lb/>A blustering letter and discoursed at large
<pb n="174"/>
<lb/>About Parmida and king Sawa’s host,
<lb/>How he and his own troops had fought, the gift
<lb/>That had been given to him by the Shah—
<lb/>That woman’s coif and that black distaff-case—
<lb/>Then said thus: "<q>Thou wilt never more behold me
<lb/>E’en in a dream so draw thy fish-hook up.</q>"<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Jamais, même en rêve, tu ne me verras porter sous le bras du linge sortant de l’eau.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>While thine illustrious, high-fortuned son,
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, is seated on the throne
<lb/>At his command will I make mountains plains,
<lb/>And deserts like Jihun with foemen’s blood.
<lb/>Young though he be still he is fit to rule,
<lb/>And faithful, not a faithless one like thee.
<lb/>I have accepted him as king of kings,
<lb/>And will henceforth be man to none beside."
<lb/>His wish was that the king should put to death
<lb/>The son though innocent<note>Couplet omitted.</note> because he feared
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, a young and charming prince.<note>Five couplets omitted.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1859"/>
<lb/>The fortune-favoured envoy reached Baghdad
<lb/>With men of name from Rai. Hurmuzd grew pale
<lb/>As fenugreek when he received the letter.
<lb/>Anon accounts of that new coinage reached him,
<lb/>Which added grief to grief. He writhed, suspected
<lb/>His son, and spake thus to Ayin Gashasp:—
<lb/>"<q>Khusrau Parwiz hath grown so bold that he
<lb/>Fain would revolt; moreover he hath struck
<lb/>A brand-new coinage! Could he hold me cheaper?</q>"
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp replied: "<q>Be courser and charger
<lb/>Ne’er seen without thee. Though Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Is thine own son he should be bound for this.</q>"
<lb/>Hurmuzd made answer: "<q>Presently will I
<lb/>Remove this upstart.</q>"
<lb/>That ambitious lord
<pb n="175"/>
<lb/>Thus answered him: "<q>May none prevail without thee.</q>"
<lb/>They called one privily by night and set him
<lb/>Before the Shah who said: "<q>Perform my bidding,
<lb/>And rid earth’s surface of Khusrau Parwiz.</q>"
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: "<q>I will, and charm love from my heart,
<lb/>So let the Shah assign me from his store
<lb/>Bane, and some dark night when Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Is drunken I will drug his wine. This way
<lb/>Is better than to shed his blood.</q>"
<lb/>The son,
<lb/>Unwitting that his ruin was proposed,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Sat in his palace gloriously, intent
<lb/>On charming Idols and on pleasant wine,
<lb/>And ignorant of all. A chamberlain
<lb/>Heard of the plot, banned appetite and sleep,
<lb/>Sped to Khusrau Parwiz and made all clear.
<lb/>He, hearing that the monarch of the world
<lb/>Was plotting secretly to slay him, fared
<lb/>From Tisfun by night, and thou hadst said:—
<lb/>"<q>He vanished from the world.</q>" He did not give
<lb/>His priceless head away but reached apace
<lb/>Azar Abadagan. When tidings came
<lb/>To all the chiefs—the marchlords of that province:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1860"/>
<lb/>"<q>Khusrau Parwiz, aggrieved against the king,
<lb/>Hath fled with some few cavaliers,</q>" those magnates
<lb/>Sought for the traces of that well-loved prince;<note>Three couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>All went, both troops and chiefs, to make him Shah.
<lb/>They said: "<q>O prince! crown, throne, and helm befit thee,
<pb n="176"/>
<lb/>And from Iran and desert of the spearmen,
<lb/>As many of the swordsmen and brave leaders,
<lb/>As thou mayst wish, will come to thee. Thy Grace
<lb/>Will lead the army on. Fear no disaster,
<lb/>But live great, glad, and well beloved.</q>"<note>Two couplets omitted.</note> Although
<lb/>Three hundred thousand horsemen of Iran
<lb/>Shall mount the saddle to discomfit thee,
<lb/>We all will give our bodies to be slain
<lb/>For thy sake and will honour those that fall."
<lb/>He said: "<q>I fear the Shah and folk, ye chiefs!
<lb/>Unless ye come before Azargashasp,
<lb/>And take great oaths to assure me that henceforth
<lb/>Ye will be loyal to me; then will I
<lb/>Abide here in all confidence and fear
<lb/>Not Ahriman.</q>"
<lb/>The warriors, when they heard
<lb/>His words, all set forth for Azargashasp.
<lb/>They took the oath he desired, protesting:—
<lb/>"<q>We hold thy love as precious as our eyes.</q>"
<lb/>Assured about the chiefs he secretly
<lb/>Sent agents everywhere to learn what said
<lb/>His father of his flight and purposed next.
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing that Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Had fled, sent hastily to put Bandwi
<lb/>And Gustaham in bondage as suspects;
<lb/>Both were the uncles of Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Upon the mother’s side and heroes bold.
<lb/>All others of his kin beside these two
<lb/>They also haled to ward without to-do.

<milestone unit="calced" n="1861"/>
<lb/>Then to Ayin Gashasp thus spake the Shah:—
<lb/>"<q>I lack advice and sorrow is my mate.
<lb/>Now that my son hath gone how shall we treat
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, that slight, self-willed slave?</q>"
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp sought an expedient
<lb/>To make his counsel gracious and replied:—
<lb/>"<q>Exalted Shah! Bahram Chubina oft
<lb/>Hath spoken of me and of all things he
<lb/>Desireth most my blood for I was first
<lb/>To vex him privily, and to dispatch me
<lb/>In fetters to him may prove serviceable.</q>"
<lb/>The Shah made answer: "<q>This is not my work,
<lb/>But miscreant Ahriman’s. I will dispatch
<lb/>A host; be thou its leader and prevail;
<lb/>But send him first one of our counsellors
<lb/>To learn his purpose. Fortune, if he seeketh
<lb/>Power, crown, and throne, will turn from him at last,
<lb/>While if he shall remain a loyal liege
<lb/>'Twill be the better for him in the end.
<lb/>Him will I give a portion of the world,
<lb/>And set upon his head the heroes’ crown.
<lb/>The world hath scarcely such a warrior,
<lb/>But, though like Rustam, he is still my thrall.
<lb/>Inform me of his doings every whit;
<lb/>Proceed with diligence; cut short the way.</q>"
<lb/>The order given by the prudent Shah
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp obeyed.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="178"/>
<lb/>There was a captive,
<lb/>And fellow-citizen of his, within
<lb/>The royal prison, eager for release.
<lb/>On hearing that Ayin Gashasp, the horseman,
<lb/>Was going to the war he sent to say:—
<lb/>"<q>O battle-loving warrior! I am
<lb/>Thy fellow-citizen and now in prison.
<lb/>Thou art acquainted with my quality.
<lb/>I, if thou wilt but beg me from the king,
<lb/>Will fare with thee on this campaign and risk
<lb/>My life before thee when I am released
<lb/>From this strait prison-house.</q>"
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp
<lb/>Thereat sent to the monarch of the world
<lb/>A man in haste to say: "<q>There is in bonds
<lb/>A fellow-citizen of mine in fear
<lb/>And peril who will go with me.if now
<lb/>The Shah will grant him pardon for my sake.</q>"
<milestone unit="calced" n="1862"/>
<lb/>The Shah replied: "<q>How should this useless wretch
<lb/>Fight in the front of thee? Thou pleadest for
<lb/>A murderer, a scamp, and thief! Dost thou
<lb/>Look for reward? Still I have now no choice
<lb/>Though ’twere the greatest of calamities.</q>"
<lb/>He gave Ayin Gashasp that man compact
<lb/>Of ill, that villain, thief, and murderer,
<lb/>And then Ayin Gashasp led forth the host,
</p>
<p>
<pb n="179"/>
<lb/>And marched like wind as far as Hamadan,
<lb/>Where he encamped and asked: "<q>Is any one
<lb/>Skilled in astrology or presages
<lb/>Within this noble city?</q>"
<lb/>All replied:—
<lb/>"<q>Our readers of the stars shall come before thee,
<lb/>And earn thy praise.</q>"
<lb/>An old, officious townsman
<lb/>Came bustling up and said: "<q>There is a dame
<lb/>Both old and rich here, and thou mightest say:—
<lb/>‘She is the stars’ eye.’ What she saith is so;
<lb/>Her prophecies will surely come to pass.</q>"
</p>
<p>
<pb n="180"/>
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp, on hearing this, dispatched
<lb/>One with a horse for her and when she came
<lb/>He asked her how the Shah fared and of him
<lb/>Who led the host, then added: "<q>Bring thy lips
<lb/>Close to mine ear and tell me if my soul
<lb/>Will quit my swarthy body in its bed,
<lb/>Or wounded by the weapon of a foe?</q>"
<lb/>While thus he spake of secrets to the crone
<lb/>With voice so low that none could overhear them
<lb/>The man for whom he had obtained release,
<lb/>And taken as companion on the journey,
<lb/>Approached and, as he passed by that sage dame,
<lb/>Looked at the general and went his way.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="181"/>
<lb/>The ancient dame inquired: "<q>What man is that?
<lb/>A blow of his will make one weep for thee.
<lb/>Thy dear life lieth in his hand, and may
<lb/>He perish, skin and marrow!</q>"
<lb/>At her words
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp recalled a former presage,
<lb/>Which he had heard from readers of the stars
<lb/>But had forgotten. Thus it ran: "<q>Thy fate
<lb/>Shall be in thy companion’s hand—a man
<lb/>Both mean and poor—who will go far with thee,
<lb/>And in return for friendship shed thy blood.</q>"
<lb/>He gave her presents and dismissed her quickly,
<lb/>But could not sleep or eat for care. He wrote
<lb/>A letter to the Shah: "<q>The man whom I
<lb/>Send back should not have been released for he
<lb/>Is worse than dragon’s spawn, and so the Shah
<lb/>Informed his slave who lacked the imperial Grace.</q>"<note>The divine insight pertaining to lawful kingship.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1863"/>
<lb/>When this man cometh bid the ill-disposed<note>The executioner, according to Mohl, but execution sometimes was embittered by being entrusted to the hands of a private enemy.</note>
<lb/>Behead him instantly."
<lb/>He wrote and set
<lb/>His seal thereon. When it was dry he called
<lb/>His fellow-citizen, much lauded him,
<lb/>Bestowing gifts and many hearty blessings,
<lb/>Then said: "<q>Convey this letter unperceived
<lb/>And quickly to the monarch of the world.
<lb/>Bring his reply to me with all dispatch,
<lb/>And see that thou remain not with the king.</q>"
<lb/>The young man took the letter from the chief;
<lb/>His mind was all surmises at that mission,
<lb/>And thus he said: "<q>I have endured enough
<lb/>Of prison, heavy bonds, and want of food;
<lb/>But God delivered me from my distress,
<lb/>From grief, affliction, and mine evil fortune;
<lb/>Yet now that I return to Tisfun
<lb/>My blood and marrow seethe.</q>"
<lb/>He journeyed sadly
<lb/>Awhile, then broke the letter open, read it,
<lb/>And marvelled at the process of the world.
<lb/>He said: "<q>My neighbour begged my life and urged:—
<lb/>‘The act is worthy of the prince,’ so how
<lb/>Should he be now insistent for my blood
<lb/>Unless some dream hath moved him to this ill?
<lb/>But now to bloodshed he shall see the way,
<lb/>And rest from travail and endeavouring!</q>"
<lb/>He turned back musing, went as swift as wind,
<lb/>And on arrival found the chief alone.
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp was seated in his tent,
<lb/>Without attendant, scimitar, and steed
<lb/>Absorbed in thinking on the king and all
<lb/>That fortune might inflict upon himself.
<lb/>Now when his neighbour came within his tent
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp knew that he proposed bloodshed.
<lb/>The murderer drew his scimitar; the chief
<lb/>Implored him much and said: "<q>Deluded one!
<lb/>Did not I beg thy lost life from the Shah?</q>"
<lb/>The other answered: "<q>Granted. What have I
<lb/>Done that thou Shouldst deal ill with me?</q>"
<lb/>He smote
<lb/>The noble chief across the neck, determined
<lb/>His fighting and his feasting, and bore off
<lb/>His bloody head unnoticed from the tent.
<lb/>Let him that seeketh honour never be
<lb/>Alone, in war-time more especially.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The miscreant left the murdered in his blood,<note>Or with Mohl: <quote xml:lang="fra">Il sentit que le sang versé le rendait infame.</quote></note>
<lb/>Sped to Bahram Chubina and exclaimed:—
<lb/>"<q>See thy foe's head — the man's who sought to harm thee!
<lb/>He marched against thee, knowing not thy purpose.</q>"
<milestone unit="calced" n="1864"/>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina asked: "<q>Who is it? Who
<lb/>Will mourn this head?</q>"
<lb/>He said: "<q>Ayin Gashasp,
<lb/>The cavalier, who left the court for war.</q>"
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said: "<q>The man was good,
<lb/>And he had come from court to reconcile
<lb/>The Shah and us, and thou hast ta'en his head
<lb/>While sleeping! Now will I requite thee so
<lb/>That folk shall sore bewail thee.</q>"
<lb/>He bade set
<lb/>A gallows at the door in sight of all,
<lb/>And gibbeted the wretch alive, thus rousing
<lb/>The hearts of evil-doers. Many horsemen
<lb/>Brought by Ayin Gashasp from court sought out
<lb/>Bahram Chubina when their chief had perished,
<lb/>While many others sought Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>And some the Shah. A flock will stray just so
<lb/>Un-herded on a day of wind and snow.

<p>
<lb/>When tidings reached the king of that famed hero,
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp, he shut the gate of audience
<lb/>For grief; none saw him too with wine in hand;
<lb/>He could not rest or eat or sleep; his eyes
<lb/>Were full of tears. At court the talk ran much
<lb/>Upon the Shah and his secluded state.
<lb/>One said: "<q>Bahram Chubina seeketh fight,
<lb/>Desirous of the throne of majesty.</q>"
<lb/>Another said: "<q>Aggrieved against the Shah
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz is marching on Iran.</q>"
<lb/>Confounded at the case the warriors
<lb/>Each held a different view, and as the bruit
<lb/>Arose from Tisfun the monarchy
<lb/>Lost credit while its servants' heads were full
<lb/>Of grief and wrath, preferring curse to blessing.
<lb/>Few troops remained about the gate; the world
<lb/>Grew strait to the Shah’s heart.
<lb/>Then tidings reached
<lb/>Bandwi and Gustaham: "<q>The Grace of kingship
<lb/>Is darkened.</q>"
<lb/>All the captives loosed their bonds,
<lb/>And sent forth one to ascertain and learn
<lb/>What warriors kept the portal of the Shah,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1865"/>
<lb/>And having learned rebelled, threw off restraint,
<lb/>And broke from ward; shouts rose that shook the plain;

<p>
<pb n="183"/>
<lb/>All unabashed, rode hot-foot to the court,<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>And gallant Gustaham harangued the troops:—
<lb/>"<q>This is no trivial case, for if ye join
<lb/>With us ye must ban reverence for the Shah.
<lb/>If ye will all gird up your loins in vengeance
<lb/>For those Iranian chiefs, because Hurmuzd
<lb/>Hath turned upon the innocent, henceforth
<lb/>Hail him not Shah; we will requite his deed,
<lb/>And turn for him the waters of Iran
<lb/>To colocynth. We will direct your course,
<lb/>And set a new Shah on his throne. If ye
<lb/>Show weakness we will leave Iran to you:
<lb/>A corner of the world will do for us,
<lb/>And thither with our comrades will we go.</q>"
<lb/>The whole throng at the words of Gustaham
<lb/>Began to curse the Shah’s peace and exclaimed:—
<lb/>"<q>Down with a king that sheddeth his son's blood!</q>"
<lb/>The troops thus heartened fired the palace-gate,
<lb/>Made entry of the imperial hall, and reached
<lb/>The presence of the Shah, that man of Grace.
<lb/>When they had ta'en his crown and flung him headlong
<lb/>Down from his throne they set upon his eyes
<lb/>The searing irons, and the radiant Lamps
<lb/>Were darkened. Then they suffered him to live,
<lb/>And gave his treasure shamefully to spoil.
<lb/>Such are the doings of the exalted sky!
<lb/>Affect not thou this Wayside Hostelry,
<lb/>Wherefrom we have our whiles of wealth and woe,
<lb/>And in the end must quit them both and go.
<lb/>The hundredth and the hundred thousandth year
<lb/>As soon as they are numbered disappear.
<lb/>The man by whom good fortune would be won
<lb/>Must speak no evil and must list to none.<note>In C. and P. the reign ends here.</note>

<head>XLII. KHUSRAU PARWIZ: HE REIGNED THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS</head>

<div><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>
The deposition of <name>Hurmuz</name> leaves <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> and
<name>Bahram Chubina</name> rivals for the throne. After abortive negotiations <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> is compelled to flee to <name>Rum</name> and
<name>Hurmuz</name> is put to death. On the way to <name>Rum</name> <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>
is saved from capture by the devotion of his maternal uncle <name>Bandwi</name>. <name>Bahram Chubina</name> assumes the crown and frustrates a plot against himself. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> is well received in <name>Rum</name>, is given <name>Caesar’s</name> daughter in marriage, and returns to <name>Iran</name> with a <name>Roman</name> army. He is joined by <name>Bandwi</name> and others. After a severe struggle <name>Bahram Chubina</name> is forced to take refuge with the Khan of <name>Chin</name> in whose service he greatly distinguishes himself but as he is preparing to invade <name>Iran</name> his death is compassed by <name>Kharrad</name>, son of <name>Barzin</name>, at the instigation of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>. The Khan avenges
<name>Bahram Chubina</name> whose sister, <name>Gurdiya</name>, he asks in marriage.
<name>Gurdiya</name> escapes with her brother's partisans to <name>Iran</name>. <name>Khusrau
Parwiz</name> to avenge his father puts to death <name>Bandwi</name> whose brother <name>Gustaham</name> rebels and marries <name>Gurdiya</name>. She murders her husband at the instigation of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> who marries her himself and accords pardon to her adherents. He treats the city of <name>Rai</name> harshly but relents at her request. He organizes the realm. <name>Maryam</name>, <name>Caesar’s</name> daughter, gives birth to <name>Shirwi</name>
(<name>Kubad</name>) on which occasion <name>Caesar</name> asks for the return of the
True Cross but is refused. The poet then tells of the case of the fair <name>Shirin</name>, who murders <name>Marvan</name>, and that of <name>Barbad</name>, the minstrel, and of the greatness of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>. <name>Shirwi</name> is imprisoned, but the troops at length revolt and release him.
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> is dethroned and put in ward.</p></div>

<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> (<name>Chosroes II</name>, A.D. 590-628) was contemporary with three Eastern Roman Emperors—<name>Maurice</name> (A.D.
582-602), <name>Phocas</name> (A.D. 602-610), and <name>Heraclius</name> (A.D. 610-
642). The word “Parwiz” seems to be a variant of the
Persian word “<name>Piruz</name>” which means “victorious.” Certainly
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> did more to justify such a title than any
Shah since the days of <name>Darius Hystaspis</name>. Egypt and the whole of the Roman possessions in Asia fell into his hands, and Persian troops were encamped within a mile of Constantinople. The genius of <name>Heraclius</name>, however, at length turned the tide. On all these great events the Shahnama is silent and the bulk of the material of the reign is made up from the
Romance of <name>Bahram Chubina</name><note n="1">See p. 72.</note> which leaves his sister, <name>Gurdiya</name>, firmly established in the favour of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> though with <name>Shirin</name> in the neighbourhood it seems doubtful whether she would be allowed to retain her position long.<note n="2">Cf. pp. 364, 389.</note> The reign is the last great one of the poem and towards the end of it

<quote><l>bad begins, and worse remains behind.</l></quote></p>

<p>§ 4. <name>Tabari</name> also states that the meeting between <name>Khusrau
Parwiz</name> and <name>Bahram Chubina</name> took place on the <name>Nahrawdan</name>.<note n="3">NT, pp. 274, 278.</note></p>

<p>§5. The proverb is in the Persian <name>Tabari</name> but is spoken by
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> when about to combat with three Turks.<note n="4">ZT, ii. 292.</note>
See below.</p>

<p>§§ 6-7. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name><note n="5">NT, pp. 274, 280.</note> the three Turks are encountered by <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> after his return from <name>Rum</name>,<note n="6">ZT, ii. p. 291.</note> not as here and in <name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p>§ 8. <quote><l>Thou shalt not kill, but need’st not strive</l>

<l>Officiously to keep alive.</l></quote>
probably about represents the share of responsibility that
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> had in his father’s murder. <name>Bandwi</name> and
<name>Gustaham</name> were his maternal uncles.</p>

<p>§9. According to the Persian <name>Tabari</name> <name>Bahram</name>, the son of
<name>Siyavush</name>, had married <name>Bahram Chubina’s</name> niece.<note n="7">ZT, ii. 283.</note></p>

<p><name>Firdausi</name>’s description of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ place of refuge is somewhat grandiloquent. It appears to have been a hermitage<note n="8">ZT, ii. 280.</note> or monastery.<note n="9">NT, p. 281.</note></p>

<pb n="188"/>

<p>§§ 12. For the wife of Bahram, son of Siyawush, see above.</p>

<p>Mausil, prince of <place>Mush</place>, was a member of the <name>Mamigonian</name> family, celebrated in Armenian history.<note n="1">NT, p. 285, RSM, 319.</note></p>

<p>§ 13. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, on quitting <place>Ctesiphon</place> in his flight, crossed the <place>Euphrates</place> and went to <place>Ambar</place>, thence followed the course of the stream and recrossing it reached the Roman frontier-station of <place>Circesium</place>. Subsequently at the invitation of the Emperor <name>Maurice</name> he took up his residence at <place>Hierapolis</place>.<note n="2">NT, p. 282 note, RSM, p. 480 and note.</note>
</p>
<p>According to the Persian <name>Tabari</name> the Arab was <name>Ijas</name>, son of
<name>Kabisa</name>. He was one of the chiefs of the <orgName>Bani Tayy</orgName> tribe<note n="3">ZT, ii. 286.</note> famous for its hospitality. He was made governor of <place>Hira</place> by
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> after the execution of <name>Nu’man</name>, the last prince of the dynasty, and commanded the Persians at the battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place>.<note n="4">ZT, ii. pp. 286, 318 seq.</note> The Persian <name>Tabari</name> omits the meeting with the merchant.</p>

<p><name>Karsan</name> looks like a Persian form of <place>Circesium</place> but is a shortened form of <place>Karistan</place>, a busy place. The miracle is not in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p><place>Warigh</place>, as appears from the account in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>,<note n="5">ZT, ii. 288, For Dhu Kar see p. 190.</note> was <place>Rakka</place> (Nicephorium, Callinicus) now in ruins. Some miles to the south-west of it lay the city of <place>Reseph</place> or <place>Rasafa</place>, also now in ruins, in which was the shrine of the celebrated
Saint <name>Sergius</name> who with his consort Saint <name>Bacchus</name> suffered martyrdom under <name>Maximian</name>. The town was in consequence known as <place>Sergiopolis</place>. Either from a genuine but temporary impulse or from policy <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> during his exile in
<place>Rum</place> much affected Christianity, adopted <name>Sergius</name> as his patron
Saint and after recovering his throne still continued to send gifts to, and ask favours of, that shrine. <name>Tabari</name> makes <name>Sergius</name> the leader of the Roman army that effected the restoration of
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>.<note n="6">See NT, p. 284 and note, ZT, ii. 288, GDF, v, 375 and note, RSM,
Pp. 497 and note.</note> In the <title>Shahnama</title> the hermit—<name>Sergius</name>.</p>

<p>§17. The terms on which the Emperor <name>Maurice</name> agreed to help <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> included the cession of <place>Dara</place>, <place>Martyropolis</place>, and perhaps <place>Nisibis</place>.<note n="7">NT, p. 285 note, RSM, p. 482 and note, GDF, v. 375 and note.</note> Western authorities are silent about the marriage of the Emperor’s daughter <name>Maryam</name> to
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, but <name>Nöldeke</name> points out that <name>Shirwi</name>'s preeminence at the Persian court is best explained by the assumption that his mother was a princess. <name>Shirin</name>, who naturally was antagonistic to him in the interests of her own son, <name>Mardanshah</name>, was unable to prevail against him.<note n="8">NT, p. 283 note, RSM, P. 504 note.</note></p>

<pb n="189"/> 

<p>§§ 19-20. These are not in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p>§21. The army lent to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> by the Emperor
was commanded by <name>Narses</name>, a Persian in the Roman service,
an able general who was afterwards cruelly put to death by
<name>Phocas</name>.<note n="9">GDF, p. 373 and note, 391.</note> <name>Nivatis</name> (<name>Theodosius</name>) was the seven years old son,
and so described in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>,<note n="10">ZT, ii. 291.</note> of <name>Maurice</name> and had
already been crowned by the Emperor. He may have accompanied <name>Narses</name>.<note n="11">NT, p. 284 note.</note></p>

<p>§23. The mission of <name>Dara Panah</name> is not in the Persian
<name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p>§§ 24-26. Historically the events of the campaign seem to
have been briefly as follows: <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> with his Roman
allies marched to the lesser <place>Zab</place> in order to effect a junction
with his native and Armenian supporters with whom were
his two uncles and <name>Mausil</name>. <name>Bahram Chubina</name> vainly tried
to prevent this. He then offered battle with his back to the
<place>Zagros</place> mountains but was compelled to retreat to higher
ground where <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> attacked him against the opinion
of <name>Narses</name>, who, however, with his Roman troops saved the
situation when <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> was in imminent danger of
disaster. This incident appears as the intervention of <name>Surish</name>
in the <title>Shahnama</title>.<note n="1">See p. 299.</note> In the meantime a detachment of the
allied forces had occupied <place>Seleucia</place> and <place>Ctesiphon</place>. The outcome of the situation was that <name>Bahram Chubina</name> retreated
through the mountains in his rear to the neighbourhood of
<place>Takht-i-Sulaiman</place> in order to maintain his communications
with <place>Rai</place> and eastern <place>Iran</place> generally. He was pursued and
after a further retirement was defeated decisively and escaped
with the remnant of his forces by way of <place>Rai</place> and <place>Damghan</place>
to the <orgName>Turks</orgName>.</p>

<p>§27. The Persian <name>Tabari</name> lays the scene with the carline in the neighbourhood of <place>Hamadan</place>. Thence <name>Bahram Chubina</name> proceeds to <place>Rai</place> and <place>Damghan</place>. He then defeats a mountain-chief named <name>Keran</name> and takes him prisoner but releases him.<note n="2">ZT, ii. p. 296 seq.</note></p>

<pb n="190"/>

<p>§ 30. According to <orgName>Sasanian</orgName> usage <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> inaugurates his reign by visiting the Fire-temple at <place>Shiz</place>.<note n="3">Vol. i. p. 60.</note></p>

<p>§31. The death of <name>Firdausi</name>’s son took place apparently about A.D. 1004.</p>

<p>§ 32. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> the name of the chief that domineered over the <name>Khan</name> was <name>Paighi</name>—the word used for the races of the north in <name>Daqiqi</name>'s portion of the <title>Shahnama</title>.<note n="4">Vol. v. p. 21 and note.</note> He was the <name>Khan</name>'s brother and claimed to have a better title to the throne.<note n="5">ZT, i. 302.</note></p>

<p>§ 34. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> it is a bear that carries off
the <name>Khan</name>’s daughter and <name>Bahram Chubina</name> rescues her.<note n="6">ZT, i. 302.</note></p>

<p>§37. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> the queen is concerned directly in the murder of <name>Bahram Chubina</name>. She is heavily bribed and provides the assassin.<note n="7">ZT, i. 303.</note> So too in <name>Tabari</name>.<note n="8">NT, p. 289.</note></p>

<p>§ 39. The crafty <name>Kharrad</name>, son of <name>Barzin</name>, as <name>Firdausi</name> calls him, but whose real name was <name>Hurmuzd Garabzin</name> or <name>Galabzin</name>, may be identical with the chief who commanded one of the
Persian wings at the battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place><note>See below.</note> and was killed,<note n="9">NT, pp. 289 and note, 335 note, 338, 341, 342.</note> but according to the <title>Shahnama</title> he was alive at the accession of
<name>Kubad</name> (<name>Shirwi</name>).</p>

<p>The battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place>, though the forces engaged in it do not appear to have been large, was a very memorable affair.
The events that led up to it are given at length in <name>Tabari</name>. It will be sufficient to say here that a long series of intrigues resulted in the execution of <name>Nu’man bin Munzir</name> by order of
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>. This ended the dynasty of the princes of
<place>Hira</place>, and <name>Ijas bin Kabisa</name><note>Cf. p. 188.</note> was appointed the Persian governor by the Shah who ordered him to collect and dispatch to the
Persian court all <name>Nu’man</name>’s effects. The Arab chief, <name>Hani bin Mas’ud</name>, who had been entrusted with them refused to give them up. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> instructed <name>Ijas</name> to enforce compliance, and the battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place>, in which the Persians were overthrown, followed. Where <place>Dhu Kar</place> was is not clear but it was not far from the <place>Euphrates</place> and <place>Kufa</place>, and had an all the year round water-supply which made it a great resort of the Arab tribes in the summer at which season the battle was fought. The Arabs celebrated their victory with songs of triumph, and its results and those of the Persian policy that

<pb n="191"/>
led up to it were very important. The destruction of the dynasty of the princes of <place>Hira</place>, which had formed a buffer state between the Persians and the Arabs, was a political blunder. The defeat was a display of weakness on the part of the Persians in a region at no great distance from their own capital. It gave the Arabs independence, encouraged them to make raids into Persian territory, and was a glorious and stimulating memory with which tradition soon associated
<name>Muhammad</name> himself when the time came for the great Arab invasion of <place>Iran</place>. For these reasons the battle called for some notice here although there is no mention of it in the <title>Shahnama</title>.
It was fought some time between A.D. 604-610.<note>See for the above generally NT, p. 310 seq. and notes, ZT, ii. 309 seq.</note></p>

<p>§§ 40-42. According to <name>Tabari</name> the <name>Khan</name> wished to marry
<name>Gurdiya</name> to his brother who pursues and is killed by her.<note n="1">NT, p. 289.</note>
</p>

<p>
§§ 44-47. On these see NT, p. 478 seq. The story of the revolt of <name>Gustaham</name> seems only to be known from various versions of the Romance of <name>Bahram Chubina</name>. <name>Bandwi</name> appears to have been killed early in the reign about the year
A.D. 591. <name>Gustaham</name> rebelled shortly afterwards and held out till about A.D. 595.</p>

<p>§ 52. <name>Shirwi</name> seems to have been <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ eldest son but who his real mother was is unknown.<note>Cf. p. 188.</note> His troubles with his father sprang from <name>Shirin</name>’s ambition on behalf of her own son, <name>Mardanshah</name>.<note>NT, p. 357, note.</note></p>

<p>§§ 53-54. According to the <title>Shahnama</title> the Cross had been long indeed in the possession of the Persians. Here the carrying off is attributed to <name>Ardshir</name> not <name>Darab</name>.<note>Vol. v. p. 306, and note.</note> Historically they took it when they captured <place>Jerusalem</place> in A.D. 614.<note>NT, p. 291 note.</note> It was given back as one of the terms of peace between <name>Heraclius</name> and <name>Kubad</name> (<name>Shirwi</name>) in A.D. 628.
</p>
<p>
The statement that <name>Jesus</name> laughed upon the Cross is a corollary from the notion, common among the Gnostics, that he was not really crucified but someone in his stead. The more accurate form of the statement would be that quoted in <name>Photius</name> from a work called “The Journeys (or Circuits) of the Apostles” (<title xml:lang="grc">Ἀποστόλων Περίοδοι</title>) viz. that <name>Christ</name> was not crucified but another in his place, and that therefore he laughed at the crucifiers (<quote xml:lang="grc">τὸν Χριστὸν μὴ σταυρωθῆναι 'αλλ᾽ ἕτερον ᾿αντ᾽ ᾿αυτῶν, καί
καταγελᾷν διὰ τόυτο τῶν σταυρούντων</quote>),<note>DBP, cod. 114.</note> <name>Muhammad</name> in the <name>Kuran</name>

<pb n="192"/> 

adopted this view which of course became the belief of his followers: "They slew him not, and they crucified him not, but it was made to appear so to them."<note>RK, p. 551 and note. Cf. SK, l. 62 and notes, 116 and notes.</note></p>

<p>§56. <name>Shirin</name> has been described by different authorities as of <place>Roman</place>, <place>Greek</place>, <place>Armenian</place>, and <place>Persian</place> descent. She has been identified also with <name>Maryam</name>, the problematical wife of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>—a view that receives no support from the <title>Shahnama</title>. There is a general agreement that she was a Christian.<note>Cf. p. 195.</note> According to the <title>Shahnama</title> the association of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> with <name>Shirin</name> began during his father’s lifetime.
This is affirmed also in some accounts quoted by <name>Mir Khand</name> according to which <name>Shirin</name> was in the service of a Persian noble at whose house <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> in his youth occasionally visited. There he saw <name>Shirin</name>, fell in love with her, and gave her a ring. The noble got to know of what was going on and ordered a servant to drown her. She saved herself, however, with the servant’s connivance and took refuge with a hermit.
After <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> became Shah she got the ring conveyed to him, and he carried her off to <place>Mada’in</place> in great state.<note>RM, Pt. 1. Vol. ii. p. 399.</note> If
<name>Shirin</name> really managed to retain her influence over <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> for the best part of a lifetime, she must have been possessed of a very exceptional personality. The devotion to her of her lover, <name>Farhad</name>, is celebrated in <name>Nizami</name>’s poem of
“<title>Khusrau and Shirin</title>” (A.D. 1180). <name>Farhad</name>, famous for his architectural and engineering skill, seems to be an historical character. To him with some probability may be attributed the responsibility for <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ triumphal arch at <place>Takht-i-Bustan</place> near <place>Kirmanshah</place> and his palace at <place>Mashita</place>
(<place>Mashetta</place>) some twenty-five miles due east of the northern end of the Dead Sea. The date of the construction of this palace, of which the exquisitely carved stone facade is now in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin, however, is still disputed.<note>A general view of the ruins, as they were, and a detail of the ornamentation, are given in RSM, p. 594 seq.</note> <name>Farhad</name> is not mentioned in the <title>Shahnama</title>. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> <name>Shirin</name> is stated to have been a Greek, to have predeceased <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, and to have been loved by <name>Farhad</name>, but it is not said that she was in love with him.<note>ZT, ii. 304.</note>
</p><p>
<name>Firdausi</name> does not suggest that she was of other than Persian

<pb n="193"/> 

origin, and she is said to have been a native of <place>Khuzistan</place>.<note>NT, p. 283 note.</note>
</p><p>
Her name is derived from the Persian word for milk, “shir,” and so comes to mean “sweet.”</p>
<p>§57. A somewhat similar story is told of the Egyptian
<name>Amasis</name> by <name>Herodotus</name>.<note n="1">RH, Bk. ii, ch. 172.</note></p>

<p>§ 58. The murder of <name>Maryam</name> by <name>Shirin</name> is on the face of it
a poetical fiction suggested by the known enmity felt by <name>Shirin</name> with regard to <name>Shirwi</name> who, as a parricide to be, is here represented in an unfavourable light. His imprisonment probably was brought about by <name>Shirin</name> in the interests of her own son
<name>Mardanshah</name> and nearly had the effect desired.<note n="2">ZT, ii. 305.</note></p>

<p>§60. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> <name>Sarkash</name> is called <name>Sergius</name>.<note n="3">For an illustration of the ruins see RSM, frontispiece.</note></p>

<p>§61. The palace here referred to must be the <place>Takht-i-
Khusrau</place> whose façade and vast hall on the left bank of the
<place>Tigris</place> some twenty-five miles below <place>Baghdad</place> form the finest remains of <orgName>Sasanian</orgName> architecture. The palace, however, seems to have been built not in the days of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> but in those of his grandfather <name>Nushirwan</name> and, as <name>Firdausi</name> states, a Roman architect may have been employed. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> from about the time of the outbreak of the Roman war
(A.D. 603), after the murder of the Emperor <name>Maurice</name> by <name>Phocas</name> till nearly the end of his reign, held his court at <place>Dastagird</place> not at <place>Ctesiphon</place>.<note n="4">See p. 194.</note></p>

<p>§§ 63-65. The reign of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> bears a considerable resemblance to that of <name>Assurbanipal</name> (B.C. 668-626). Their seats of government were on the same historic stream—<place>Dastagird</place> and <place>Mada’in</place> in the former case, <place>Nineveh</place> and <place>Calah</place> in the latter. Both reigns were long and the last great ones of their respective dynasties. The wars of both monarchs covered much the same ground—<place>Syria</place>, <place>Armenia</place>, <place>Asia Minor</place>, and <place>Egypt</place>. In both cases a season of military brilliancy and territorial expansion was followed by one of cumulative disaster. In both cases the national resources were over-strained and in both cases the subsequent collapse came with startling suddenness.
</p>
<p>The account given by <name>Firdausi</name> of the causes that led to the fall of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> and of the fall itself may be amplified from other authorities thus:—In A.D. 626 the <orgName>Sasanian Empire</orgName>, though it had suffered shrewd blows in the previous

<pb n="194"/> 
campaigns of <name>Heraclius</name>, was still after nearly a quarter of a century of warfare far from being worsted. It was not <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> but <name>Heraclius</name> that made several vain attempts to bring about peace. The Persian army under <name>Shahrbaraz</name>
(the <name>Gurdz</name> of <name>Firdausi</name>) still occupied <place>Chalcedon</place>, divided only by a mile, but an impassable mile, of sea from <place>Constantinople</place>.
The Persians had good cause to deplore their lack of sea-power.
To get over this difficulty they made arrangements for a mixed horde of <orgName>Avars</orgName>, <orgName>Slavs</orgName>, and other tribes, who had no straits to cross, to attack <place>Constantinople</place>. That city was besieged accordingly but proved impregnable to the resources of the barbarians. <name>Heraclius</name>, meanwhile, contented himself with operations in <place>Lazica</place> but his brother, <name>Theodore</name>, worsted the
Persians in <place>Asia Minor</place>. In this connexion we have an instance of the way in which <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> treated his unsuccessful generals. The defeat of the Persians on the occasion in question seems largely to have been due to the effects of a severe hail-storm. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, however, was very wroth and when the Persian commander died of despondency shortly afterwards he had the body embalmed and sent to him to be maltreated.<note n="1">CTC, Vol.i. p. 485.</note> In A.D. 627 <name>Heraclius</name> determined on a Winter campaign against his enemy’s capital. He defeated the
Persians near <place>Nineveh</place> on December 12th and then marched on
<place>Dastagird</place>, some seventy miles above <place>Ctesiphon</place>, where <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>
had held his court for the previous twenty years in consequence, it is said, of a prediction made to him when besieging <place>Dara</place> in the days of the Emperor <name>Phocas</name> that he would perish on the next occasion that he entered <place>Ctesiphon</place>.<note n="2">CTC, Vol.i. p. 494, 496.</note>
Nevertheless, he retreated thither, abandoning <place>Dastagird</place> to its fate, and then crossed the <place>Tigris</place> to <place>Bih-Ardshir</place> (Seleucia), taking with him <name>Shirin</name>, two sons of his by her, and three daughter-wives.<note n="3">CTC, Vol.i. p. 496, 499.</note> His eldest son, <name>Shirwi</name>, and his other sons were in internment at <place>Akr Babil</place>, a state-prison near <place>Babylon</place>.<note n="4">NT, p. 356 and note.</note>
At <place>Bih-Ardshir</place> the Shah armed his personal attendants etc. and sent them to reinforce the defeated Persian army which had made no effective stand since the battle of <place>Nineveh</place>. These combined forces, with two hundred elephants, took up their position on the river <place>Arba</place>, a short distance from <place>Ctesiphon</place> and broke down the bridges.<note n="5">CTC, p. 498.</note> On January 11th A.D. 628
<name>Heraclius</name> advanced from <place>Dastagird</place>, which he had devastated,

<pb n="195"/> 
and three days later encamped within twelve miles of the <place>Arba</place>.
He sent <name>George</name>, the leader of the Armenian contingent, to reconnoitre the Persian position and on his report retreated northwards to the neighbourhood of <place>Lake Urumiah</place> where he passed the rest of the Winter. Shortly before he had made another of his appeals to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> for an accommodation: “I follow thee and am instant for peace, for I do not of mine own will consume Persia with fire but because I am forced thereto by thee. Now therefore let us throw down our arms and welcome peace. Let us put out the fire before all is burned.” The Shah refused the offer to the exasperation of his people<note n="6">CTC, p. 498.</note> with whom he was already very unpopular because, according to <name>Tabari</name>, he despised them and treated their great men without regard, had given the barbarian <name>Farrukhanzad</name>, son of <name>Sumai</name>, power over them, and ordered the execution of the captives, and intended to put to death the
Persian troops defeated by <name>Heraclius</name>.<note n="7">NT, p. 356. The prisoners are said to have numbered 36,000.</note> He had also, it seems, sent instructions for the putting to death of the Persian general
<name>Shahrbaraz</name>, but the bearer of the letter was taken by the
Romans. <name>Heraclius</name> informed <name>Shahrbaraz</name> who falsified the letter by making the order apply to forty other chiefs as well as to himself and read out the dispatch as altered to the assembled Persian leaders. In their wrath they renounced their allegiance to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, made terms of peace with
<name>Heraclius</name>, and decided to quit <place>Chalcedon</place> and return home.<note n="8">CTC, i. 497.</note>
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> also had managed to offend his native Christian subjects. In earlier days he had been disposed favourably towards them, and we have seen how he placed himself under the special protection of S. <name>Sergius</name>,<note n="9">p. 188.</note> while his wife, <name>Shirin</name>, was a Christian of the <orgName>Nestorian</orgName> persuasion. She was, however, lured over to the <orgName>Monophysites</orgName> and used her influence against the <orgName>Nestorians</orgName> who in consequence were not allowed to choose a <title>Catholicus</title>. A very highly esteemed <orgName>Nestorian</orgName> named <name>Yazdin</name> was chief tax-collector. After his death <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> seized his property and did not bestow by way of compensation the vacant post on <name>Yazdin</name>’s son, <name>Shamta</name>, who also was a <orgName>Nestorian</orgName> and afterwards took a prominent part in the revolt against the Shah. Towards the end of the reign the <orgName>Monophysites</orgName> also had cause for complaint against

<pb n="196"/>

<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>. Generally speaking, too, all Christians must have been horrified at the sack of <place>Jerusalem</place> and the carrying off of the True Cross.<note>See for the above NT, pp. 357, 383 and notes.</note> There was therefore no lack of discontent throughout the army and nation generally. The retreat of <name>Heraclius</name>, however, at a moment when the state seemed threatened with imminent peril, might have staved off matters for a while had it not been for the question of the succession. It is said that <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> when he fled from
<place>Dastagird</place> to <place>Ctesiphon</place> was suffering from dysentery and wished to secure the crown for his son <name>Mardanshah</name>, the offspring of <name>Shirin</name>.<note>CTC. 1. 499.</note> <name>Shirwi</name>, the Shah’s eldest son, who
was in internment with many of his brothers, was therefore in a situation of imminent peril. A conspiracy was formed to make him Shah and rescue the captives in the prisons. Among the conspirators were two sons of <name>Shahrbaraz</name>, <name>Shamta</name>, son of
<name>Yazdin</name>, and <name>Mihr Hurmuzad</name>, the son of a former governor of
<place>Nimruz</place> who had fallen a victim to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ jealous suspicions.<note>NT, p. 379 and note. <name>Nöldeke</name> does not consider the execution of the governor historical.</note> A party of the nobles hastened to ’Akr Babil and brought <name>Shirwi</name> by night to <place>Bih-Ardshir</place> (Seleucia) where, at the bridge of boats, which it would be important to seize, he was met by others of the conspirators. The prisons were thrown open, and that night <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> heard the shouts that hailed <name>Shirwi</name> as “<name>Kubad</name> Shahanshah.” When the rebels approached the palace in the early morning the royal bodyguard fled and <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> escaped into his garden which was called ‘The Garden of the Indians’ but was discovered shortly and taken prisoner. The date, according to our reckoning, was February 25th, A.D. 628.<note>NT, p. 356.</note></p>

</div>

<div><head>§ 2 How Khusrau Parwiz sat upon the Throne and made an Oration</head>
<p>
<lb/>Whenas Khusrau Parwiz sat on the throne
<lb/>Of gold the men of noble birth repaired
<lb/>To him. They summoned all the chiefs and showered
<lb/>Gems over that new crown. He thus addressed
<lb/>The archmages: <q>No one save the fortunate</q>
<lb/><q>Can win this crown and throne. May mine employ</q>
<lb/><q>Be right alone for from injustice cometh</q>
<lb/><q>All loss. ‘We purpose well to all. Our head</q>
<lb/><q>Is void of evil-doing. This new throne,</q>
<lb/><q>And this new fortune bright and opulent,</q>
<lb/>Are mine from God. Do ye withal incline
<lb/>Your hearts to obey and covenant with us
<lb/>To observe three things in all contingencies:
<lb/>To harm not holy men, not to rebel,
<pb n="198"/>
<lb/><q>And to abstain from others’ goods for why</q>
<lb/><q>The pang will pass to him that did the wrong,</q>
<lb/><q>Whene’er it chanced, and sold his heart for naught.</q>
<lb/>Now must your hands be washed from things like these,
<lb/>The path of right ensued. Moreover wisdom
<lb/>Approveth what accordeth best to manhood.
<lb/>I have no difference with any one
<lb/>Although such sought my crown and signet-ring.
<lb/>The man of high birth and of noble nature
<lb/>Will speak but right. Your safety is assured:
<lb/><q>I will not work the works of Ahriman.</q>
<lb/>All those that heard the Shah blessed crown and throne,
<lb/>And going forth rejoicing praised his fortune,
<lb/>While he descended from the throne of might
<lb/>Right glad and mused upon Hurmuzd all night.</p>
</div>

<div><head>§ 3 How Khusrau Parwiz visited his Father and asked Forgiveness</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1868"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the ebon Veil had disappeared,
<lb/>And in the distance cock-crow reached the ear,
<lb/>The winner of the world with stricken heart,
<lb/>And deeply sorrowful, approached his sire,
<lb/>On seeing him lamented, did obeisance,
<lb/>And tarried long with him. Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>Beholding his sire’s face, sighed deeply, kissed
<lb/>His eyes and head and feet, then said to him
<lb/>With full heart and with face all wet with tears:—
<q><lb/>“My father, fortune’s mate, thou memory
<lb/>Of Nushirwan! thou know’st that none had pricked
<pb n="199"/>
<lb/>Thy finger had I been but there to help thee.
<lb/>See what thou wilt command me; grief hath come
<lb/>Upon thee and my heart is full. If now
<lb/>Thou biddest I am at thy gate a slave
<lb/>To guard thy head. I seek not crown, I want
<lb/>Not host, and lay my head before thy throne.”</q>
<lb/>Hurmuzd replied: <q>“O prudent one! my day
<lb/>Of misery will pass from me, and he
<lb/>That perpetrated this will soon be gone:
<lb/>Both trouble and delight are transient.
<lb/>I ask three things of thee, no more, and one
<lb/>Is that each morning at the break of day
<lb/>Thou wilt delight mine ears with thine own voice;
<lb/>The second is that thou wilt send to me
<lb/>Some noble cavalier scarred with long fight
<lb/>To talk to me of warfare and the chase,
<lb/>And some old sage to hold discourse of kings,
<lb/>And bring to me the records to abate
<lb/>My pain and misery; and my third wish
<lb/>Is that thy mother’s brothers, who are not
<lb/>Thine equals but thy slaves, shall never see
<lb/>The world henceforth: discharge thy wrath on them
<lb/>For all this grief.”</q>
<lb/>“O king!” he made reply,
<q><lb/>“May that man perish who deploreth not
<lb/>Thine eyes and be thy foes, though their ill deeds
<lb/>Be secret, banished from the world, but still
<lb/>Consider in that lucid mind of thine:
<lb/>Bahram Chubina hath been paladin
<lb/>While with him there are countless forces—horsemen
<lb/>And gallant sworders—and if we lay hand
<lb/>On Gustaham no refuge will be left us;</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1869"/>

<q><lb/>But as regardeth an old scribe to read
<lb/>The annals, and some war-primed cavalier,
<lb/>Skilled in the feast withal, I will dispatch
<lb/>Such ever new to thee. Be no whit sad,</q>
</p>
<pb n="200"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>And hold not thou the action Gustaham’s;
<lb/>‘Tis God’s because of senseless words and deeds.
<lb/>May thy heart bear this anguish, and may patience
<lb/>Consort with wisdom; but should fortune serve
<lb/>I will myself exact complete revenge
<lb/>On Gustaham and reprobate Bandwi,
<lb/>And give them shroudless to the dogs to eat.
<lb/>Be of good cheer, O son of Nushirwan!
<lb/>And may thy soul be ever young.”</q>
<lb/>He spake,
<lb/>And left the presence weeping but reserved.
<lb/>The son was kindlier-tempered than the king
<lb/>In which regard a man of wisdom said:—
<q><lb/>“A bland youth, sweet-tongued, is a better friend
<lb/>Than some fierce warrior ageing to his end,
<lb/>Yet at the last dust is the common lot
<lb/>Of one of parts and one that hath them not;
<lb/>Albeit to learn of one there is no need,
<lb/>Who saith that wits and fools are of one breed,
<lb/>For knowledge will ensure thy fair surcease,
<lb/>And heaven in Paradise will give thee peace.
<lb/>As victuals serve to keep the body whole,
<lb/>So knowledge is all needful for the soul.
<lb/>Cry to the Holy and Supreme in all,
<lb/>And be all undismayed at great or small.”</q>
</p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 4 How Bahram Chubina heard of the Blinding of Shah Hurmuzd and how he led his Troops against Khusrau Parwiz</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina heard how fortune dealt
<lb/>With that famed king: <q>They set the searing irons

<pb n="201"/>

<lb/>To his bright eyes, and those two Lamps, those twin
<lb/>Narcissi of his garth, are dead, his son
<lb/>Is seated on his throne and his high fortune
<lb/>Is trodden underfoot.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>The hero, was amazed, grew wan, and pondered.
<lb/>He said: <q>The time for me to fight hath come;
<lb/>By daring I will seize the world.</q>
<lb/>He bade
<lb/>To bear forth to the field the kettledrums
<lb/>And flag of majesty. He packed the baggage,
<lb/>He called his warriors to horse and spake
<lb/>Of waging war against Khusrau Parwiz.
<lb/>His host, as 'twere a moving mountain, marched
<lb/>Audaciously as far as Nahrawan.
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1870"/>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, on hearing, was in dudgeon
<lb/>At such swift action and sent spies to note
<lb/>The progress of events with these behests:—
<q><lb/>We first must learn the feeling of his troops:
<lb/>If like Bahram Chubina they intend
<lb/>To fight or whether we shall have delay,
<lb/>And whether he be foremost at the centre
<lb/>Or at the wings, his state at audience-time,
<lb/>And if he hunteth while upon the march.</q>
<lb/>They went unnoted by the troops, gat news,
<lb/>And came back to the Shah all privily.
<lb/>They said: <q>His troops are for Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>All from the highest chieftains to the boys.
<lb/>In marching he is sometimes at the centre,
<lb/>And sometimes with the right or left or baggage.
<lb/>We saw him long of sight and diligent—
<lb/>A cautious warrior and cavalier.
<lb/>His kinsmen all are in his confidence;
<lb/>He hath no need of strangers, giveth audience
<lb/>In royal fashion, hunteth on the plain
<lb/>With cheetahs, knoweth but the usages

<pb n="202"/>

<lb/>Of Shahs, and readeth all the book of Dimna.<note>The Fables of Bidpai. See Vol. vii. p. 382.</note></q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz said to his minister:—
<q><lb/>A long task faceth us. Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>When he is charging at an enemy,
<lb/>Would break the hearts of dragons in the deep,
<lb/>And from the monarch of the world withal
<lb/>Hath learned the methods of the kings of kings,
<lb/>While, thirdly, with Kalila, <note>The Fables of Bidpai. See Vol. vii. p. 382.</note>so to speak,
<lb/>As minister none hath so shrewd a scribe.</q>
<lb/>Then said he to Bandwi and Gustaham:—
<q><lb/>Our mates are grief and toil.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Gurdwi,
<lb/>Darman, the monarch of Armenia,
<lb/>Shapur and Andaman, shrewd chiefs and fighters,
<lb/>Were set in secret conclave with the Shah
<lb/>He thus addressed them: <q>Mighty warriors!
<lb/>When wisdom is a light within the brain
<lb/>Then knowledge is the body’s coat of mail,
<lb/>Which naught except the sword of death will sever,
<lb/>A sword whereto a steel helm is as wax.
<lb/>I am but young to you so cannot walk
<lb/>The world aright; instruct me what to do.
<lb/>Who suffereth from these wounds?</q>
<lb/>An archmage said:—
<q><lb/>Thou wilt be happy and the Grace and provand
</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1871"/>
<pb n="203"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>Of empty brains. Now since the mystery
<lb/>Of this our whirling world grew manifest
<lb/>Hath wisdom been disparted into four.
<lb/>One portion is the king’s for Grace and wisdom
<lb/>Fit him; another is the pious man’s;
<lb/>The third the loyal hege’s who as near
<lb/>The royal person tendereth advice;
<lb/>The wise account the small part left the thane’s.
<lb/>The impious and unthankful have no wisdom.
<lb/>If now the king will hear the old sage’s words,
</q>
<lb/>And fix his heart’s eye on them, he will eat
<lb/>Their fruit when they have passed within his heart.”
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>‘Were I to write this down
<lb/>In gold its Grace and vogue would ask no less;
<lb/>The archimages’ utterances are gems,
<lb/>But I have other purposes at heart,
<lb/>For when our two hosts meet, and when our spearheads
<lb/>Shall reach to Gemini, I shall not be
<lb/>Blamed if I quit the centre and advancing
<lb/>Before the host call to Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>That impious and self-seeking general,
<lb/>Show him a peaceful face, make much of him,
<lb/>And praise him. If he shall receive my words
<lb/>Tis well, for who at court can be his peer?
<lb/>But if he seeketh fight I too will fight,
<lb/>And range my host against his.</q>
<lb/>All the leaders
<lb/>Assented to his scheme, the great applauded,
<lb/>And hailed him king of earth; all said: <q>Oh! be
<lb/>The ills of fortune far from thee, O king!
<lb/>Be victory, Grace, majesty, and crown
<lb/>Of king of kings thine own.</q>
<lb/>He answered thus:—
<q><lb/>So be it; enough. May none of us behold
<lb/>Disunion or defeat.</q>
<lb/>Then from Baghdad,
<lb/>And with new camp-enclosures, he marched forth
<lb/>Upon the plain. As the two powers drew near
<lb/>Upon the march, the captain of the host’s
<lb/>On that side and on this the Shah's, and when
<lb/>The world’s light had been taken in the toils,
<lb/>And pitchy night had shaken out its locks,
<lb/>Scouts went forth from both hosts to guard the approaches;
<lb/>And when night, frighted by the sword of day
<lb/>Had fled dry-lipped and quaking, rose the din
</p>
<pb n="204"/>
<p>
<lb/>Of tymbals from both camps and Sol led forth
<lb/>To war. Then at the Shah’s command Bandwi
<lb/>And Gustaham put on their iron helms,
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1872"/>
<p>
<lb/>And went with other chiefs of ardent soul
<lb/>Toward the canal <note>‘Spring’ in the original.</note> of Nahrawan, whereat
<lb/>The outpost came before Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is a force two bowshots off.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this he ranged his host and called
<lb/>His veterans and bestrode a piebald steed
<lb/>With musk-black tail—a noble caracoller
<lb/>With brazen hoofs. An Indian scimitar
<lb/>Sufficed to arm him, and its stroke was like
<lb/>The levin from the cloud. He urged his horse
<lb/>As ’twere a lightning-flash. That miscreant,
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, was on his left. Withal
<lb/>There came Hamdan Gashasp <note>Reading with P.</note> and Yalan-sina,
<lb/>All rage and enmity, while three bold Turks,
<lb/>Sprung from the Khan, made ready to take vengeance
<lb/>Upon Khusrau Parwiz and swore: <q>When we
<lb/>Shall see the Shah out-distancing his troops,
<lb/>Him will we bring to thee in bonds or slain,
<lb/>And thy realm shall repose in peace.</q>
<lb/>On one side
<lb/>There was Khusrau Parwiz and on the other
<lb/>The paladin, between was Nahrawan,
<lb/>While on both sides the armies watched them meet,
<lb/>And how the paladin the Shah would greet.</p>

<div><head>§5 How Khusrau Parwiz and Bahram Chubina met and parleyed</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina and Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Thus met, one cheerful and the other grim.
</p>
<pb n="205"/>
<p>
<lb/>The world-lord rode an ivory grey and wore
<lb/>A gold and jewelled crown; his robe from Chin
<lb/>Was of brocade of gold. Gurdwi as guide
<lb/>Preceded him, Bandwi and Gustaham
<lb/>Were at his side, and therewithal Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, who wore a helm of gold.
<lb/>They all were clad in iron, gold, and silver;
<lb/>Their golden girdles were occult with gems.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina paled with rage on seeing
<lb/>The king of kings and thus addressed his chiefs:—
<q><lb/>“This whoreson miscreant from low estate
<lb/>And boorish manner hath attained to manhood,
<lb/>Grown powerful and girt himself for action.
<lb/>The writing of the down is manifest
<lb/>Upon the ivory rondure of his face;
<lb/>So now he hath become Shah Faridun
<lb/>With mace and crown and caught the imperial style,
<lb/>But speedily will this world end for him.
<lb/>This dark-souled bastard leadeth on his troops
<lb/>Like Nushirwan. Scan thoroughly his host
<lb/>To see if there be of it one of name.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1873"/>
<p>
<lb/>I cannot spy one warlike cavalier
<lb/>That could confront me for a single breath.
<lb/>Now shall he look upon the deeds of men,
<lb/>Steeds charging, scimitars, the dust of war,
<lb/>The clash of battle-axes, showers of arrows,
<lb/>The heroes’ shouts, the captives, give and take.
<lb/>The elephants are driven from the field
<lb/>When I march forth to battle. At our voice
<lb/>The mountains melt and warriors lose their prowess.
<lb/>I take the rivers with my sword and turn
<lb/>Their waters into blood.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake and spurred
<lb/>His pied steed, thou hadst said: “His flying eagle.”
<lb/>He chose himself a narrow battlefield,
<lb/>The troops in wonder watching him, and thence
</p>
<pb n="206"/>
<p>
<lb/>Went on to Nahrawan and there confronted
<lb/>The glorious Great with certain of Iran,
<lb/>Armed for the conflict with Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>Who said: “O noble chiefs! who recogniseth
<lb/>Bahram Chubina?”
<lb/>Said Gurdwi: “O king!
<lb/>Observe the warrior on the piebald steed,
<lb/>With white juppon, black baldrick, and who rideth
<lb/>About among the troops.”
<lb/>He recognised
<lb/>The man at sight and said: “Yon lengthy one,
<lb/>Smoke-hued and riding on the noble piebald?”
<lb/>Gurdwi replied: “The same and bent on ill.”
<lb/>“If thou shouldst question,” said Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>“That crook-back he would answer churlishly;
<lb/>With that hooked nose and half shut eyes he hath,
<lb/>Thou wouldest say, ‘a wrathful heart.’ Thou seest
<lb/>That he is wicked by his looks, God’s foe.
<lb/>I mark naught of submission in his head,
<lb/>And that none will command him.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>To Bandwi
<lb/>And Gustaham he said thereafter: “I
<lb/>Will give an illustration of this saw:—
<q><lb/>‘If ‘neath the load the donkey will not pass
<lb/>Then take the weighty burden to the ass.’
<lb/>If some bold div hath gulled Bahram Chubina
<lb/>How should he see God’s way? All hearts that ache
<lb/>With greed are helped not by the advice of wisdom.
<lb/>When thou goest forth to war debate is over.
<lb/>We must consider all from first to last:
<lb/>Who knoweth which will conquer in the fight,
<lb/>Which host be doleful or illustrious?
<lb/>Considering those troops so well arrayed,
<lb/>And with a leader eager for the fray,
<lb/>Such as Bahram Chubina is—a man
<lb/>Grim as a lusty div—and militants</q>
</p>
<pb n="207"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1874"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>Like ravening wolves, I will, with your consent,
<lb/>So that disgrace may not attach to me,
<lb/>Be first to make advances; ‘twill be better
<lb/>For me than showing slackness in the fight.
<lb/>If I receive from him a fair reply
<lb/>His late misdoings shall be obsolete;
<lb/>I will bestow some corner of the world
<lb/>Upon him and by bounty earn his thanks;
<lb/>Our warfare and endeavours in the field
<lb/>Shall end in peace—a gain to us. No doubt
<lb/>The wisest course is safest. Good folk joy
<lb/>When monarchs act as merchants do.”</q>
</p>
</div>

<div><head>§5 How Khusrau Parwiz and Bahram Chubina met and parleyed</head>
<p>
<lb/>“O king!”
<lb/>Said Gustaham, “live happily while time
<lb/>Shall last. Thou scatterest gems in talk and art
<lb/>More wise. Do what thou willest. Thou art just,
<lb/>And yon slave is unjust; thy head is full
<lb/>Of brains and his of wind.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>On hearing this, advanced before his troops,
<lb/>Held distant parle with brave Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And sought for feast in war-time. Thus he said:—
<q><lb/>“Illustrious man! what business hast thou here
<lb/>Upon the battlefield? Thou art as though
<lb/>The jewel of the court, the wealth of throne
<lb/>And diadem, the army’s prop in war-time,
<lb/>And as a bright light at our festivals.
<lb/>Thou art ambitious, brave, and servest God;
<lb/>Ne’er may the Almighty take His hand from thee.
<lb/>I have considered of thy case, approved
<lb/>Thine acts, will entertain thee and thy troops,
<lb/>And make my soul glad by the sight of thee.
<lb/>I will appoint thee general of Iran,
<lb/>As is but right, and I will pray to God
<lb/>For thee.”</q>

<p>
<lb/>He gave his black-tailed, piebald steed the rein,
<lb/>Saluted from his seat, paused, and replied:—
<q><lb/>“In good case, blithe, and fortunate am I,
<lb/>And may the day of greatness ne’er be thine,
<lb/>Who knowest not kingship whether just or not.
<lb/>The Alans’ king in the conduct of his kingship
<lb/>Is being helped by the unfortunate!
<lb/>I have considered of thy case and suppled
<lb/>A lasso for thy sake. I will erect
<lb/>Forthwith a lofty gibbet, make thy hands
<lb/>Fast in the coils, and hang thee up thereon
<lb/>As thou deservest, giving thee a glimpse
<lb/>Of fortune’s bitterness.”</q>

<p>
<lb/>He knew: “Bahram Chubina will not yield,
<lb/>And part with crown and throne,” and thus replied:—
<q><lb/>“Ingrate! No good man would speak thus. When guests
<lb/>Come to thy house from far dost thou revile them
<lb/>At feasting-time? This note is not the wont
<lb/>Of Shahs or of the exalted cavaliers.
<lb/>No Arab and no Persian e’er have acted
<lb/>Like this in thirty centuries. The wise
<lb/>Would shame hereat, so go not thou about
<lb/>The door of thanklessness. When guests give thee
<lb/>A glorious greeting one must be a div
<lb/>To answer as thou dost. Ill days, I fear,
<lb/>Await thee for thou knowest that thy counsels
<lb/>Are troubled. Thy resource is in the hands
<lb/>Of that Great King who liveth ever more,
<lb/>Whose word is law. Thou sinnest in His sight,
<lb/>And art ingrate, with person in disgrace,
<lb/>And heart in fear. In calling me the king

<lb/>Of my descent unless I am unworthy</q>
</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>Of kingship and the cap of power
<lb/>As having for my grandsire Nushirwan,
<lb/>And for my sire Hurmuzd. Whom knowest thou
<lb/>More worthy?”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram Chubina: <q>“Wretch,
<lb/>And mad in deed and word! first, for thy talk
<lb/>Of guests: thou art thyself new-fangled though
<lb/>Thy talk is of the past. What have the words
<lb/>Of Shahs to do with thee? Thou art no sage,
<lb/>Or valiant cavalier. Thou wast the Alans’ king,
<lb/>And now though thou art chief thou art withal
<lb/>Inferior to the slave of slaves. Thou art
<lb/>A fruitless evil-doer in the world;
<lb/>No Shah art thou or fit to lead the mighty;
<lb/>But me men bless as Shah. I will not let thee
<lb/>Set foot on earth. Moreover, when I said:—
<lb/>‘Thou art ill-starred, unfit for rule and kingship,’
<lb/>I said it, worthless Shah! and may the state
<lb/>Be never thine! because the Iranians
<lb/>Are foes of thine, will struggle to uproot thee,
<lb/>Will rend thy skin and veins, and give the dogs
<lb/>Thy bones to eat.”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied:—
<q><lb/>“Knave! why so fierce and haughty, for foul words
<lb/>Disgrace a man? But from the very first
<lb/>Thy disposition hath been thus; clear wisdom
<lb/>Is severed from thy brain. Blest is the noble
<lb/>That eateth wisdom’s fruits! Fey divs discourse
<lb/>At large. I would not have a paladin
<lb/>Like thee made weak and ruined by his temper.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1876"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>I prithee banish anger from thy heart,
<lb/>Be not so moved and charm away thy wrath.
<lb/>Remember God, the just Possessor; base
<lb/>Thy wisdom on His justice. Thou hast now
<lb/>A height before thee higher than Bistun,
<lb/>And if a king shall ever come of thee</q>
</p>

<lb/>Such principles of Ahriman, I know not,
<lb/>But thy colloguer seeketh for thy death.”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake and lighting from his ivory steed,
<lb/>And taking from his head the precious crown,
<lb/>Walked with his face turned sunwards, put his hope
<lb/>In God, and said: <q>“O glorious Judge who bringest
<lb/>The tree of hope to fruit! Thou knowest who
<lb/>Is now affronting me, Thy slave, and how
<lb/>We should for very shame bewail the crown.
<lb/>If royalty is to desert our race
<lb/>I will not strive but be a thrall within
<lb/>A Fane of Fire and live on milk and herbs,
<lb/>Hoard neither gold nor silver and at prayer-time
<lb/>Wear woollen; but if rule is to be mine
<lb/>Thee will I serve in truth and equity.
<lb/>Oh! let my host prevail, give not my crown
<lb/>And palace to a slave. If I succeed,
<lb/>And haste to bring before Azargashasp
<lb/>Crown, steed, and armlets, earrings, torque, and robe
<lb/>Of gold adorned with gems, and pour withal
<lb/>Upon the dome of lapis-lazuli
<lb/>A hundred sacks of red dinars, and give
<lb/>The worshippers five thousand score of drachms,
<lb/>When I become the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Then will I strive to reinstate some city
<lb/>Unjustly desolated and the haunt
<lb/>Of onager and lion, leave it not
<lb/>To thorns and weeds, but send on my return
<lb/>From battle five score thousands of dinars.
<lb/>Those of the scions of Bahram and others
<lb/>That shall be brought to me as prisoners</q>
</p>
<pb n="211"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>Will I make servants of the glorious Fire,
<lb/>And glad the hearts of priest and archimage.”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake these words and rose up from the dust;
<lb/>That speaker sore-oppressed was justified.
<lb/>Swift as a dust-cloud from the place of prayer
<lb/>He came and shouted to Bahram Chubina:—
<q><lb/>“Thou hellish, div-like slave remote from wisdom,
<lb/>And far removed from precedent and Grace!
<lb/>Some rabid, tyrannous, and lusty div
<lb/>Hath blinded thee. Thou hast, in wisdom’s stead,
<lb/>Wrath and revenge, and won the divs’ applause.
<lb/>A thornbrake is a city, Hell a garden
<lb/>To thee; the lamp of wisdom hath died out
<lb/>Within thy brain and robbed thy mind and heart
<lb/>Of lustre. It was but a lying witch
<lb/>That led thee thus through greatness to a fall.
<lb/>To-day thou settest hand upon a shoot
<lb/>With leaves of bane and fruit of colocynth.
<lb/>Thy stock ne’er so aspired nor is the ‘aspirant
<lb/>Applauded. God hath not bestowed on thee
<lb/>The Grace and stature. Hast forgot Gurgin,
<lb/>Son of Milad? Thou unjust wretch! ne’er hope
<lb/>For what will never be. The crab hath not
<lb/>The eagle’s wing nor doth the eagle soar
<lb/>Aloft the sun. By holy God, by throne
<lb/>And crown if I shall come upon thee hostless,
<lb/>And if I blow a chilling blast upon thee...!
<lb/>Thou hast not seen me yet in fight and I
<lb/>Have heard but thy harsh words. I lean on Him
<lb/>That giveth victory. If I am unworthy
<lb/>To be a king let me not live a liege.”</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said:
<lb/>“Thou fool possessed!

<lb/>Who ne’er blew cold on anyone, thou knewest not”
</p>
<pb n="212"/>

<lb/>When, from the daughter of Papak, Ardshir

<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: “Contentious fool!
<lb/>If kingship is for those of royal race
<lb/>What dost thou in their midst? What are the folk
<lb/>Of Rai but double-faced? And what as men?
<lb/>But few at first they joined Sikandar’s host,

<lb/>The Judge that giveth succour crowned Ardshir,
<lb/>And he was worthy of the royal crown
<lb/>Although he had no treasure and dinars.
<lb/>Those great men’s work hath passed away, our words

<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz

<lb/>What was the saying of the sweet-voiced sage?
<lb/>‘'Twill cause thee pain and toil to establish men

<lb/>Thou wast a brave man, keen and of high aims,

<lb/>My father made thee first among the chiefs;
<lb/>Thou wast the greatest in the sovereignty;

<lb/>A fire unquenchable, the grandson I

<lb/>To rase the Fanes of Fire and suffer not
<lb/>Naurtiz and Sada feast. The Iranians too
<lb/>Were all enslaved till I girt up my loins,
<lb/>And by an arrow from my bow determined
<lb/>King Sawa’s life. If thou knowest not the sum

<lb/>Four hundred times. Twelve hundred elephants

        <lb/>Sick, mind and body, he returned to camp.
        <lb/>His sister heard of his return, put off
        <lb/>Her splendid crown and, when a slave had brought
        <lb/>Her veil, ran forth in dudgeon sore of heart
        <lb/>To meet him and thus spake: “O warlike chief!
        <lb/>How didst thou fare, say, with Khusrau Parwiz?
        <lb/>If he be hot and hasty through his youth
        <lb/>Relax no effort in the cause of peace.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina answered thus:—
        <lb/>“One must not reckon him among the Shahs.
        <lb/>No valiant cavalier or sage is he,
        <lb/>Not generous or brilliant. Parts are better
        <lb/>Than birth, and kings should have them.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>His wise sister
        <lb/>Replied: “O shrewd, ambitious chief! if I
        <lb/>Say much thou wilt not hear me but display
        <lb/>Ill-temper and ill-nature. Call to mind
        <lb/>The saying of the aphorist of Balkh:—
        <lb/>‘When any one shall truth from hiding bring,
        <lb/>And tell thy faults, truth is a bitter thing.’
        <lb/>Think not to waste thy country for thou hast
        <lb/>Thy share of earth. A very wise man said:—
        <lb/>‘To have an ox’s horn an ass once tried,
        <lb/>And lost forthwith his ears on either side.’
        <lb/>Court not the world’s reproach; none of thy race
        <lb/>Hath worn the crown. Had this youth intervened not
        <lb/>I had not been thus seared and dark of soul;
        <lb/>But as it is his sire is living, the throne
        <lb/>Of sovereignty is still in place yet thou
    </p>
    <pb n="222"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Must interfere! How it will end I know not,
        <lb/>But all night long mine eyes are filled with blood.
        <lb/>Thine only aim is pain and malison;
        <lb/>Thou sniffest rashly at a poison-flower.
        <lb/>How folk will call Chubina infamous,
        <lb/>The name Bahram disfame! God will be wroth
        <lb/>Withal and Hell the prison of thy soul.
        <lb/>The world is not for every one, my brother!
        <lb/>And naught abideth save a fair renown.
        <lb/>Consider now, who was it sought thee out
        <lb/>Save king Hurmuzd? But since king Sawa’s throne
        <lb/>And goods came to thy hands thou didst assume
        <lb/>The crown, and having grown renowned through him
        <lb/>Art seeking for the imperial throne; but know
        <lb/>That every good thing is from God and be
        <lb/>Not ingrate to our Shah; presume not thus
        <lb/>Upon thy stricken fields. Thou hast gained honour,
        <lb/>But be not arrogant. Thou hast at heart
        <lb/>Consorted with the Div and hast grown guilty
        <lb/>In God’s sight. When Hurmuzd was wroth and raved
        <lb/>Through what the foul Ayin Gashasp had said
        <lb/>Thou shouldest have been patient and not made it
        <lb/>A liege’s opportunity for war;
        <lb/>And in his great affliction when his son
        <lb/>Came forth to fight from Barda’ ’twas thy duty
        <lb/>To visit the young Shah and ornament
        <lb/>His new throne as he wished. The youth had then
        <lb/>Adopted thine advice and thou hadst not
        <lb/>Seen evil days but quiet, joy, and triumph.
        <lb/>Why these designs upon the crown and throne?
        <lb/>Thou knowest that there still are princes left,
        <lb/>Both old and young, descended from Ardshir,
        <lb/>With wealth and countless hosts. Who in Iran
        <lb/>Will hail thee king? If any king with treasure
        <lb/>And troops could dare to eye this land of ours
        <lb/>It had been Sawa, prince of Chin, none else,
    </p>
    <pb n="223"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Who marched upon the country of Iran;
        <lb/>But holy God made thee his opposite,
        <lb/>And saved our land and elders. Since the World-lord
        <lb/>Made this world and spread over it high heaven
        <lb/>Men have not seen a cavalier like Sam,
        <lb/>Whom not the rending lion would confront,
        <lb/>Yet when it happened that Naudar became
        <lb/>Unjust and trampled on his father’s ways,
        <lb/>And when the nobles called on Sam and had
        <lb/>The turquoise throne made ready, ‘God forbid,’
        <lb/>He said, 'that ever captain of the host
        <lb/>Should contemplate the throne because the dust
        <lb/>Of Minuchihr is mine, my coronet
        <lb/>The footings of Naudar’s.' <note n="1">See Vol. 1. p. 340.</note> I recognise
        <lb/>In Sam thy better; he sought not the kingship,
        <lb/>Not being ill-conditioned. So too Zal
        <lb/>And elephantine Rustam never sought
        <lb/>To rule our folk. Know, I have said this, brother!
        <lb/>Because the fortunate alone who hath
        <lb/>August hands, Grace, and high birth, and is wise,
        <lb/>Of ardent heart and just can take the throne.
        <lb/>I know not what will come on thee, for wisdom
        <lb/>Hath vanished from thy heart!”

        <lb/>Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Made answer: “’Tis all true and holy God
        <lb/>Is witness, but the thing hath gone too far;
        <lb/>My heart and brain are sick with greed and I

        <lb/>Another there.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The youthful king for his part
        <lb/>Recrossed the bridge of Nahrawan, rejoicing,
        <lb/>Called all the captains of the host, set those
    </p>
    <pb n="224"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Entitled by their rank beside the throne
        <lb/>Of sovereignty, and said: "Good-hearted chiefs,
        <lb/>Adept and veteran! of this my kingship
        <lb/>This is my primal act—a mere essay—
        <lb/>And none doth owe us praise though our intent
        <lb/>Be good, and ye have had no good from us
        <lb/>While we must now augment your toils and griefs.
        <lb/>Ye served mine ancestors and have seen much
        <lb/>Of this world’s salts and sours. I will disclose
        <lb/>My purpose, hidden from the host, to you;
        <lb/>My words must go no further, that would mar
        <lb/>My scheme if it were published to the troops.
        <lb/>I mean to lead the host to-night to battle,
        <lb/>For I have parleyed with Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>Who is an active, skilful cavalier,
        <lb/>Though I discerned no wisdom in his head,
        <lb/>Or in the heads of his illustrious troops.
        <lb/>His fight with Sawa is his only theme,
        <lb/>He telleth o’er and o’er the same old tale.
        <lb/>He thinketh me a foolish youth and fain
        <lb/>Would frighten me with mace and scimitar,
        <lb/>Not knowing that I attack by night and so
        <lb/>Gain confidence. If ye will share the fray
        <lb/>With me I will not loiter but, when night
        <lb/>Shall steep her face in ambergris and loose
        <lb/>Her musky locks, do ye mount armed and grasping
        <lb/>The mace and scimitar.”
        <lb/>They all agreed
        <lb/>To do the Shah’s behest. When he had gone
        <lb/>Back to his tent he put all strangers forth.
        <lb/>He sent for Gustaham and for Bandwi,
        <lb/>And for Gurdwi, a veteran warrior,
        <lb/>And told his purpose of a night-attack
        <lb/>In hopes that they would aid. Said Gustaham:—
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1887"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>“O king! why put such confidence in fight?
        <lb/>A camisade may alienate thy troops.
    </p>
    <pb n="225"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Thy soldiers and the soldiers of the foe
        <lb/>Are one in heart and body; on one side
        <lb/>Are grandsons, on the other grandsires. What
        <lb/>Deception can there be? Here is a brother,
        <lb/>And there a father; they are all akin;
        <lb/>How shall son war with sire? Encourage not
        <lb/>The wishes of thy foes by this design.
        <lb/>This was no matter for the host; thy words
        <lb/>Have ruined all.”
        <lb/>Gurdwi said: “All is over,
        <lb/>E’en as a wind that passeth o’er the plain.
        <lb/>Power, passion, treasury, and troops make err
        <lb/>A young man’s head. Do not be thou to-night
        <lb/>Upon the field and suffer not the host
        <lb/>And treasure to be lost, because I doubt not
        <lb/>That all our secret plans and preparations
        <lb/>Will be reported to the other side;
        <lb/>Yield not thy head then to the enemy.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>Pleased with the rede Khusrau Parwiz assented,
        <lb/>Selected certain chiefs devoted to him
        <lb/>For good and ill—Kharrad, son of Barzin,
        <lb/>And Gustaham, the Lion, and Shapur,
        <lb/>And Andiyan, the valorous, Bandwi,
        <lb/>Kharrad, withal, the Lustre of the host,
        <lb/>Nastuh, the chief and burner up of heroes,
        <lb/>And others who would serve to guard the troops,
        <lb/>The treasure and himself. They sought a hill
        <lb/>That would avail if fight were toward—a place
        <lb/>All grass and apt for feasts. Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Thence viewed the host from far.
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>The brave, for his part mounted and when great
        <lb/>And small drew near he questioned of the chiefs:—
        <lb/>“What tidings have ye of your kith and kin?
        <lb/>Send to them, ye that have such—men at one
    </p>
    <pb n="226"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>With you in word and Faith. If they will come
        <lb/>And do my will, and stake their lives as pledges
        <lb/>Of their sincerity, I will enrich them,
        <lb/>And they shall all be nobles like yourselves.
        <lb/>The troops from Barda’ and from Ardabil,
        <lb/>And slack Armenians—a band or two—
        <lb/>Remain. We fear them not in fight while those
        <lb/>From Barda’ are but as a pinch of dust.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The chieftains heard what brave Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Proposed and chose a warrior from the host,
        <lb/>Sage, fluent, heedful, who thus charged departed,
        <lb/>And speeding onward through the longsome night
        <lb/>Declared his message to the Iranian chiefs,
        <lb/>And heard their answer: “Till the hosts engage
        <lb/>We will not leave Khusrau Parwiz. This matter,
        <lb/>We fear, will prove a long one. He will make
        <lb/>A night-attack, so feel not ye secure.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The envoy, hearing this, went swift as dust
        <lb/>Back to the army of the paladin,
        <lb/>And as a privy matter, every word,
        <lb/>He there reported all that he had heard.

    <head>§7 How Bahram Chubina attacked the Army of Khusrau Parwiz by Night and how Khusrau Parwiz fled</head>
    <p>
        Now when Bahram Chubina was aware
        <lb/>That all the troops were well disposed to him
        <lb/>His host lit watch-fires and set lights ablaze
        <lb/>In every quarter. Then that Lion chose
        <lb/>A valiant band fit to subdue the world,
        <lb/>Six thousand Sabres as the leaders reckoned.
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina told them: “When the drum
        <lb/>Shall beat at cock-crow raise the battle-cry,
    </p>
    <pb n="227"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Attack and crown the nobles’ heads with blood.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Led by the three proud Turks the troops sped forth
        <lb/>At his command and full of spite and vengeance
        <lb/>Fell on the army of the king. Arose
        <lb/>A din of mace and sword and battle-ax,
        <lb/>The earth was iron and the clouds were dust.
        <lb/>The troops all asked: “Where is Khusrau Parwiz?
        <lb/>The day and victory to-day are ours.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Khusrau Parwiz was on the hill in anguish,
        <lb/>His eyes were full of blood, his cheeks the hue
        <lb/>Of lapis-lazuli, and, till the shafts
        <lb/>Of dawn shot up, the clashing of the hosts
        <lb/>Confounded him, but when the dark night’s skirt
        <lb/>Had vanished, and he saw the battlefield
        <lb/>All killed and wounded, to his chiefs he said:—
        <lb/>"Help and put forth your powers against the foe,
        <lb/>For God, the Victor, is mine aid and prop,
        <lb/>And now my work is blows and scimitar.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He charged amain at those three Turks. Turks? Nay,
        <lb/>Three fierce and savage wolves. One closed with him,
        <lb/>Unsheathed his glittering glaive and sought to strike
        <lb/>The king upon the head; the royal rider
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1889"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Put up his shield to save it, thrust beneath
        <lb/>The guard, and laid his foeman low. "Famed fighters!
        <lb/>Slack not the struggle now,” he cried, but still
        <lb/>His troops all turned away, abandoning
        <lb/>That world-aspirant shamefully who then
        <lb/>Said to Bandwi and Gustaham: “Hereof
        <lb/>I augur ill. I have no child grown up,
        <lb/>Or other kindred, fitted for the crown,
        <lb/>And if I should be slain in fight the world
        <lb/>Would have no king.”
        <lb/>Bandwi made answer thus:—
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>“O noble prince! may this world yearn in love
    </p>
    <pb n="228"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>For thee. Thy troops are gone, abide not thou,
        <lb/>For none is left to aid thee.”
        <lb/>To Gurdwi
        <lb/>Then said the king: “Haste with Tukhar and take
        <lb/>The tent-enclosure, treasure, and brocade,
        <lb/>Crown, captives, purses, and the ivory throne,
        <lb/>All that thou canst, and take a thousand horse
        <lb/>Of those still left.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The nobles toiled to load,
        <lb/>And carry off, this treasure. Then appeared
        <lb/>A dragon-flag; the world turned violet.
        <lb/>Behind the flag rode brave Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>Who robbed the world of lustre in the fray.
        <lb/>He and Khusrau Parwiz encountered, both
        <lb/>Redoubted warriors and savage lions.
        <lb/>Like elephants of war they raged and smote
        <lb/>Each other on the head. All lion-like
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina wheeled, his weapons failed
        <lb/>Against the foe, and thus till set of sun
        <lb/>The conflict passed all bounds. Then came Tukhar
        <lb/>To tell Khusrau Parwiz that he had drawn
        <lb/>The treasure and the baggage to the bridge,
        <lb/>Whereat the monarch said to Gustaham:—
        <lb/>"We have not any helpers in the fight;
        <lb/>We are but ten; this is a mighty host,
        <lb/>And led on by a valiant paladin.
        <lb/>Although we have the Grace upon our side
        <lb/>We lack for friends, so flee we. Timely flight
        <lb/>Is better than affray. I may not tarry,
        <lb/>For I am all alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The unpractised youth
        <lb/>Fared till he reached the bridge of Nahrawan,
        <lb/>Pursued all hotly by Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>His head all vengeance and his heart all strife.
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, when he perceived this, stopped
    </p>
    <pb n="229"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Upon the bridge and summoned to his presence
        <lb/>The veteran Gustaham. "Bring me my bow,"
        <lb/>He said; "’tis mine interpreter in war."
    </p>
    <p>
        The treasurer, who was Gustaham himself,
        <lb/>Produced the bow. <note>Son trésorier le lui apporta, et Gustehem était en cette affaire le lieutenant du roi. Mohl.</note> The valiant chieftain took it,
        <lb/>And robbed the air of lustre with his shafts,
        <lb/>Showered them like hail and pegged with each a helm
        <lb/>And head together. Then Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>That Lion, charged with lasso in his hand
        <lb/>And Dragon under him. With lasso only
        <lb/>He passed behind Khusrau Parwiz who saw,
        <lb/>Rejoiced, strung up his bow and with a shaft
        <lb/>Struck on the breast Bahram Chubina’s horse;
        <lb/>Its task was done. That general afoot
        <lb/>Despairing took his buckler while Yalan-sina
        <lb/>Advanced like dust and charged. The atheling,
        <lb/>Who knew him valiant, aimed and hurt his steed.
        <lb/>Yalan-sina fled from the bridge afoot,
        <lb/>And with him fled the rest, both old and young.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now when Bahram Chubina thus withdrew
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, swift as a dust-cloud, broke
        <lb/>The bridge and went to Taisafon in dudgeon,
        <lb/>With pain at heart and eyes fulfilled with blood.
        <lb/>He barred the city-gates with iron bars,
        <lb/>Sat down amid a multitude of cares,
        <lb/>From every quarter called to him the Great,
        <lb/>And posted sentinels at every gate.

    <head>§ 8 How Khusrau Parwiz went to his Sire and fled to Rum, and how Hurmuzd was slain</head>
    <p>
        Thence weeping blood and liver-pierced he went
        <lb/>Before his sire, gave greeting, tarried long,
        <lb/>And said: “The cavalier, the paladin,
        <lb/>Whom thou didst choose, O king! came as do Shahs
        <lb/>That have the Grace and brought a numerous host.
        <lb/>I counselled him but 'twas of no avail,
        <lb/>He only cared for war and conflict. Never
        <lb/>Be his name current! All against my will
        <lb/>Was fought a great fight, and the stars brought scath
        <lb/>On many. All my troops deserted me;
        <lb/>Thou wouldst have said they saw and passed me by,
        <lb/>And, not reflecting, hailed Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>As Shah. Pursuing me he led his troops,
        <lb/>As 'twere a moving mountain, to the bridge
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1891"/>
    <p>
        Of Nahrawan, and I, when mine estate
        <lb/>No longer flourished, fled and scaped the net
        <lb/>Of bale. As I account of gain and loss
        <lb/>The Arabs only may prove serviceable,
        <lb/>And, if the king bid, I will bring their horsemen
        <lb/>In countless numbers.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “This is ill-advised,”
        <lb/>Replied Hurmuzd, “for now thou hast no standing.
        <lb/>To go to them is labour lost, for we
        <lb/>Possess not men, or arbalists or treasure.
        <lb/>The Arabs will not help when there is naught
        <lb/>To gain or lose but in despite and dudgeon
        <lb/>Will sell thee to thy foes, yet God will aid,
        <lb/>And smiling fortune side with thee. If thou
        <lb/>Wouldst quit this land depart with speed for Rum,
        <lb/>And tell to Caesar what this slave in straits
    </p>
    <pb n="231"/>
    <p>
        Hath said. He will assist thee with his treasure
        <lb/>And troops. In that land are both men and stores,
        <lb/>And arms and host arrayed. Moreover all
        <lb/>That spring from Faridun are kin to thee,
        <lb/>And will assist thee in thy need.”

    <p>
        Thereat
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz kissed earth and gave the praises
        <lb/>Due to the Great. Then to Bandwi, Gurdwi,
        <lb/>And Gustaham he said: “We must consort
        <lb/>With grief and toil. Take order, pack, and yield
        <lb/>Our country to the foe.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Said Gustaham:—
        <lb/>"Ne’er mayst thou see ill hap, O king!”
    </p>
    <p>
        He answered:—
        <lb/>“The circling heaven produceth wrath and love
        <lb/>By turns.”
    </p>
    <p>
        With that the watchman cried: "O Shah,
        <lb/>Just and auspicious! from the road hath risen
        <lb/>Dark dust. Amid a host a standard waveth
        <lb/>Charged with a dragon, and Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Raised it beside the Nahrawan.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Thereat
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz gat on his steed like smoke,
        <lb/>And fled like flying dust with that blue banner
        <lb/>Behind him. Turning him about he saw
        <lb/>Bandwi and Gustaham proceeding slowly,
        <lb/>And shouted to them in an angry tone:—
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1892"/>
    <p>
        “O villains! what hath happened that yon foes
        <lb/>Become like friends to you? If 'tis not so
        <lb/>Why ride at leisure with Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Hard on your backs?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Bandwi replied: “O king!
        <lb/>Be not concerned at him; he will not see
        <lb/>Our dust, the host's flag is too far away.
        <lb/>Thy friends all say there is no cause for haste
        <lb/>Because Bahram Chubina, when he reacheth
    </p>
    <pb n="232"/>
    <p>
        The palace, will at once give to Hurmuzd
        <lb/>The crown and throne, will sit as minister
        <lb/>Beside him, and will angle to some purpose
        <lb/>By writing from his sovereign to Caesar
        <lb/>To this effect: ‘A worthless slave hath fled
        <lb/>This country; let him not obtain asylum
        <lb/>In Rum. Each time that he hath raised himself
        <lb/>He hath done hurt and damage to your land.
        <lb/>When he arriveth put him into bonds,
        <lb/>And fill with trouble his rejoicing heart.
        <lb/>Return him to this court and tarry not
        <lb/>Until he have grown great,’ and they will bind him,
        <lb/>And send him back in tears and strongly guarded.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Khusrau Parwiz heard this with troubled heart,
        <lb/>His cheek gloomed at their words and he replied:—
        <lb/>"Ill-fortune well may treat us thus, but words
        <lb/>Are long and deeds are strong; trust we in God.”
    </p>
    <p>
        He urged his steed and said: “What good and bad
        <lb/>The World-lord hath writ o’er our heads will come,
        <lb/>No musing can avert it. May our foes
        <lb/>Ne’er have their will.”
    </p>
    <p>
        When he had gone the two
        <lb/>Unjust ones turned back eager for revenge.
        <lb/>Arrived, they sought the palace of the Shah,
        <lb/>All dudgeon and with hearts prepared for crime.
        <lb/>When they had passed the gate and reached the throne
        <lb/>They straightway took the string from off a bow,
        <lb/>Flung it forthwith around the monarch’s neck,
        <lb/>And hung his honoured person. Passed that crown
        <lb/>And throne of king of kings: thou wouldst have said:—
    </p>
    <p>
        “Hurmuzd was never in the world at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The custom of revolving time it is
        <lb/>To furnish sometimes sweets and sometimes bane;
        <lb/>Seek not for profit from a stock like this
        <lb/>Because the quest will bring thee naught but pain.
    </p>
    <pb n="233"/>
    <p>
        When thus Hurmuzd’s days ended and the throne,
        <lb/>That happy seat, remained unfilled, forthwith
        <lb/>Arose a sound of drums; those murderers’ cheeks
        <lb/>Became like sandarac. Upon the road
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina’s standard came in sight
        <lb/>Amid his troops, and that outrageous pair—
        <lb/>Bandwi and Gustaham—fled from the palace,
        <lb/>And hasted till they reached Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>Who, seeing their wan looks, knew that their hearts
        <lb/>Contained some secret, else would they have quitted
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1893"/>
    <p>
        The master of the world? His cheeks became
        <lb/>Like flowers of fenugreek but he revealed
        <lb/>Naught to that savage pair. He bade his troops:—
        <lb/>"Turn from the highway for a host approacheth.
        <lb/>Take the long route across the unwatered plain,
        <lb/>And let your bodies grow inured to pain.”

    <head>§ 9 How Bahram Chubina sent Troops after Khusrau Parwiz and how Bandwi contrived to rescue him from their Hands</head>
    <p>On entering the palace of the Shah
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina chose from his fierce host
        <lb/>Six thousand wielders of the scimitar,
        <lb/>Mailed, to pursue the king, and put Bahram,
        <lb/>The son of Siyawush, in charge of those
        <lb/>Famed, warlike troops, while on the other part
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz took to the waste to ’scape
        <lb/>His foes with life, and reached at length a hold
        <lb/>With battlements of viewless height. Folk called it
        <lb/>“The House of God”—a shrine, a blesséd spot,
        <lb/>With bishops and a metropolitan,
    </p>
    <pb n="234"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>A place for penitents. He there addressed
        <lb/>A holy man: “What food is there to hand?”
        <lb/>A bishop said: “There are unleavened loaves
        <lb/>And watercress, my lord! If such thou needest
        <lb/>Let it be none save ours.”
        <lb/>The king forthwith
        <lb/>Alighted with his escort. That aspirant
        <lb/>With his two courtiers took in hand for prayer
        <lb/>The sacred twigs, then on the soft, blue sand
        <lb/>They sat and ate in haste of what there was.
        <lb/>Thereafter he addressed the bishop thus:
        <lb/>“Hast thou no wine, old sir whose steps are blest?”
        <lb/>He said: “We manufacture wine from dates;
        <lb/>We make it in the heat of summer-time.
        <lb/>There is a little left, clear as rose-water,
        <lb/>And red as coral in the sun.”
        <lb/>Forthwith
        <lb/>He brought a cup thereof and it eclipsed
        <lb/>The hue of Sol. Khusrau Parwiz drank three,
        <lb/>Partook of barley-bread and, when his wits
        <lb/>Were warmed with ruddy wine, slept with his head
        <lb/>Laid on Bandwi’s lap on the yielding sand,
        <lb/>All sorrowful of soul and liver-pierced.
        <lb/>Just as he slept the senior bishop came.
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1894"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>“Black dust-clouds have arisen on the road,”
        <lb/>He said; “behind them is a mighty host.”
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: ‘It is bad luck
        <lb/>That ‘foes should seek us just as men and steeds
        <lb/>Are spent. The inevitable day hath come.”
        <lb/>Then spake Bandwi the good at need: "‘Yon chief
        <lb/>Approacheth.”
        <lb/>Said Khusrau Parwiz: "Good friend!
        <lb/>Direct us in the matter.”
        <lb/>He rejoined:—
        <lb/>“I will devise escape for thee, O king!
    </p>
    <pb n="235"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>In this strait, though I shall have sacrificed
        <lb/>My life to save the monarch of the world.”
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: “A sage of Chin
        <lb/>Hath uttered better things in this regard:—
        <lb/>‘In Paradise shall be his future state
        <lb/>Who here hath tilled about a monarch’s gate.
        <lb/>The plastering cannot abide in place
        <lb/>When city-walls are levelled to their base.
        <lb/>When mighty cities perish out of hand,
        <lb/>Let not the hospitals be left to stand.’
        <lb/>If shift thou knowest use it; holy God
        <lb/>Will save thee from the need of other help.”
        <lb/>Bandwi said: “Let me have the crown of gold,
        <lb/>The earrings, girdle, and the robe from Chin,
        <lb/>Gold-woven and tulip-hued, and while I don them
        <lb/>Abide not thou. Go with thy troops apace
        <lb/>As sailors speed a vessel o’er the deep.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The youth did as Bandwi advised and thence
        <lb/>Companioned with the wind. When he had made
        <lb/>Shift thus to flee, Bandwi, the veteran,
        <lb/>Turned to the bishop, saying: “Ye must tarry
        <lb/>Unseen of all upon the mountain-top,”
        <lb/>Then went himself dust-swift within the shrine,
        <lb/>And with all speed shut fast the iron door,
        <lb/>Assumed the gold-embroidered robe and donned
        <lb/>The royal crown. He went upon the roof,
        <lb/>And thence unwillingly beheld a host
        <lb/>On every side. He waited till they came
        <lb/>Up to the hold to fight. At sight of him
        <lb/>With gold crown, earrings, torque, and belt all cried:—
        <lb/>"It is Khusrau Parwiz with his new crown
        <lb/>And robes.”
        <lb/>Bandwi, when certain that the troops
        <lb/>Had taken him to be the Shah himself,
        <lb/>Went from the roof, donned his own clothes with speed,
    </p>
    <pb n="236"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>Then fearlessly returned and said: ‘Young braves!
        <lb/>To whom shall I address me as your chief
        <lb/>Because I have a message from the Shah
        <lb/>To give in presence of the mighty men?”
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1895"/>
    <p>
        The son of Siyawush, on hearing this,
        <lb/>Said: “I am chief and I am hight Bahram.”
        <lb/>Bandwi replied: “The world-lord saith: ‘My journey
        <lb/>Hath much distressed me; all our beasts are sore,
        <lb/>Foundered and all amort with lengthy travel.
        <lb/>I reached this house of penitents for rest,
        <lb/>But will at day-break give up worldly hopes,
        <lb/>And take with you the longsome road that leadeth
        <lb/>To great Bahram Chubina, and herein
        <lb/>I do not seek delay that heaven perchance
        <lb/>May succour me. Mine ancestors were wont
        <lb/>To keep the laws of honour and good faith,
        <lb/>And through their long and fortunate careers
        <lb/>They ne’er refused when subjects asked a boon.
        <lb/>So now that fortune is my foe I make
        <lb/>An open breast to you, for from bright Sol
        <lb/>To darksome dust the will of God is done.’”
        <lb/>The chief agreed and every one that heard
        <lb/>The Shah’s words grieved for him. The troopers all
        <lb/>Dismounted and kept guard on him that night.
        <lb/>Next day Bandwi went to the roof upon
        <lb/>The side that faced Bahram and said: “The Shah
        <lb/>Is praying and will do naught else to-day.
        <lb/>He spent last night in prayer. Besides, the sun
        <lb/>Is high, he must not suffer from the heat.
        <lb/>Leave him in peace to-day. At dawn to-morrow
        <lb/>He shall surrender.”
        <lb/>“This may prove a trifle,”
        <lb/>Bahram said to his chiefs, “or else of moment.
        <lb/>If we shall press him much he may be wroth
        <lb/>And fall on us. He is a host himself,
    </p>
    <pb n="237"/>
    <p>
        <lb/>A world-aspirant, shrewd and valorous.
        <lb/>If he be slain in fight Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Will send to dust from us. 'Tis best to wait
        <lb/>To-day, although our stores are running low,
        <lb/>To see if he will yield without contention.”
        <lb/>Thus was it till the night rose o’er the mountains,
        <lb/>And her host gathered, then both far and wide
        <lb/>The troops spread, kindling fires on every side.

    How Bahram, the Son of Siyavush, took Bandwi and carried him to Bahram Chubina</head>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1896"/>
    <p>
    <lb/>When earth grew sun-hued eloquent Bandwi
    <lb/>Went to the roof and thus addressed Bahram :—
    <lb/>“ Experienced one! when dust rose from the plain
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz at sight of you departed,
    <lb/>He and his troops, in haste toward Rum, and now,
    <lb/>Wert thou to wing it eagle-like and soar
    <lb/>Above the sun, thou wouldst not spy the Shah
    <lb/>Unless in Rum where he hath aged by now ;
    <lb/>But if ye grant me quarter I will come
    <lb/>Forth to thy valiant chief and I will answer
    <lb/>All questions asked of me about ourselves,
    <lb/>But if not I will arm and send the dust
    <lb/>In combat to the sun.”
    <lb/>The youth’s heart aged
    <lb/>With grief when he heard this. " What will it profit,”
    <lb/>He asked his comrades, “ if I send the reek
    <lb/>Up from Bandwi? The better course will be
    <lb/>To take him as he is with mind unclouded
    <lb/>Before the paladin to tell whatever
    <lb/>He knoweth of the Shah and either lose
    <pb n="238"/>
    <lb/>His head or keep his crown.’
    <lb/>Then to Bandwi :—
    <lb/>“ Discuss this question with Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>Thou evil schemer ! ”
    <lb/>Then Bandwi, the Lion,
    <lb/>Came down and went back with the valiant chiefs.
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina heard of their return,
    <lb/>And that Khusrau Parwiz bent on revenge
    <lb/>Had gone to Rum, and vehemently raged
    <lb/>Against the son of Siyavush, exclaiming :—
    <lb/>“Thou luckless miscreant ! thou hast disobeyed.
    <lb/>Fool that I am! I have approved a fool! ”
    <lb/>He summoned next Bandwi, the ambitious one,
    <lb/>And turned the wrath on him: “ Thou miscreant knave !
    <lb/>Blame-worthy hare who hast been so foolish
    <lb/>As thus to gull my troops! Thou couldst not rest
    <lb/>Through thine ill nature and hast now become
    <lb/>One with accursed Khusrau Parwiz, hast made
    <lb/>A youth a veteran and hast come to boast :—
    <lb/>‘I will renew this outworn age.’ ”
    <lb/>Bandwi
    <lb/>Replied: “‘ Exalted chief! look but for right
    <lb/>From me and be not fierce. Know that the king
    <lb/>Of kings is of my kin, his majesty
    <lb/>And greatness are mine own, and I have given,

    <p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1897"/>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina said: “I would not slay thee

    <lb/>By his hand soon and know that I speak sooth.”
    <lb/>They gyved Bandwi’s feet, and Bahram Chubina

        How Bahram Chubina summoned the Magnates of Iran, how they discussed his Pretensions to the Kingship, and how he acceded to the Throne</head>

        <p>
        <lb/>When Sol unsheathed its sword, and when its veil

        <lb/>And called the magnates, seating them upon
        <lb/>The dais of the kings on golden seats,
        <lb/>Which he had ranged around, and sat in Joy
        <lb/>As conquering monarchs do. Thereafter he
        <lb/>Spake with a mighty utterance thus and said :—
        <lb/>“Ye that are worshipful! now make response
        <lb/>In full assurance and auspiciously
        <lb/>Advise upon my words. Give them all heed,
        <lb/>And note my prompt dispatch. Ye will not find
        <lb/>A worse Shah than Zahhak, search as ye may,
        <lb/>Who slew his sire for kingship’s sake, whereby 
        <lb/>Iran fell to his hands ;<note n="1">See Vol. i. pp. 136, 139.</note> and now again
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, a man unjust and cursed,
        <lb/>Hath slain his father and hath gone to Rum;
        <lb/>And so till one of royal race appeareth,
        <lb/>One fit to claim the throne and make crown, girdle,
        <lb/>And fortune his who, think ye, is the man
        <lb/>To gird him at this present to restore

        <lb/>Who is the Master of the sun on high,
        <lb/>That I will give you aidance in the quest.”
        <lb/>The nobles heard the famous chieftain’s words,
        <lb/>And none dissented. Then an elder rose—
        <lb/>Shahrén Guraz, a hoary warrior,
        <lb/>A chieftain eminent—and answered thus :—
        <lb/>“Thou art a benefactor to the world,
        <pb n="240"/>
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1898"/>
        <lb/>Illustrious prince! Hadst thou not been at Rai
        <lb/>No one had matched king Sawa when he reached
        <lb/>Our coast with forces to enslave the Free;
        <lb/>But bravely thou didst arm thee and that trouble
        <lb/>Passed from the Iranians, and a host equipped,
        <lb/>And warriors all, four hundred thousand strong,
        <lb/>Fled from thy wooden shaft, and thus Iran
        <lb/>Had rest from heat and strife; so now its throne
        <lb/>Befitteth thee as thine unsleeping fortune
        <lb/>Is witness. Him that disobeyeth thee,
        <lb/>Or shunneth thine alliance, will we cause
        <lb/>To do thy will, brave though he be, and though
        <lb/>The matter touch Khusrau Parwiz himself.”
        <lb/>Thus spake he and resumed his seat, whereat
        <lb/>The chieftain Khurasan stood forth before
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina and thus spake: “I ask
        <lb/>This old, ambitious sage, who hath harangued
        <lb/>The assembly at such length, who hath inspired
        <lb/>His words? He praised thee so that all our hearts
        <lb/>Rejoiced, and yet there is a goodly saying
        <lb/>Used in the Zandavasta by Zarduhsht
        <lb/>For honest brains to hear: ‘Whoe’er shall quit
        <lb/>The Almighty’s way, admonish such one year,
        <lb/>Supplying all his needs, and after that
        <lb/>If he return not slay him with the sword
        <lb/>By order of the Shah, while if he be
        <lb/>The just Shah’s foeman let him be beheaded
        <lb/>Forthwith.’”
        <lb/>He spake, ceased, and resumed his seat.
        <lb/>Then Farrukhzad stood up. “O helpful chief!”
        <lb/>He said, “just speech is better than mishap.
        <lb/>If justice then is better perish he
        <lb/>That joyeth in unjust words.”
        <lb/>Then he spake
        <lb/>Thus to Bahram Chubina: ‘Blest be thou,
        <lb/>And may the sight of thee sustain the world.
        <pb n="241"/>
        <lb/>If these my words find favour and if God,

        <lb/>As our blest Shah, and be the hands and tongues
        <lb/>Of bad men far from thee.”
        <lb/>That valiant man
        <lb/>Sat down and Khazarwan, son of Khusrau,
        <lb/>Came forward lion-like and said: “Although

        <lb/>A cameleer and tarry not until

        <lb/>When he withdrew stepped forward Zad Farrukh,
        <lb/>And said with justice: “Chiefs of noble race!
        <lb/>I have been listening to this debate
        <lb/>Of these the chosen leaders of Iran.
        <lb/>First, that proposal worthy of a slave
        <lb/>To make a paladin the Shah is one
        <lb/>Distasteful to the wise, one to diminish
        <lb/>A man’s renown. The words of Khurasan
        <lb/>Were grand and wedded, I maintain, to wisdom,
        <lb/>While those of Farrukhzad were violent,
        <lb/>Such as would hebetate the hearts of sages.
        <lb/>The fourth to speak was Khazarwan, the chief,
        <lb/>Whose words were also wise, for since God made
        <lb/>The world the course of time is manifest.
        <lb/>Start from Zahhak, the Arab, who was both
        <lb/>Unjust and foul of Faith. He slew Jamshid,
        <pb n="242"/>
        <lb/>That overweening one, and seized the world
        <lb/>Unjustly. Holy men grieved that a div
        <lb/>Was Shah till Faridun, that glorious king,
        <lb/>Abated him. Next came that miscreant,
        <lb/>Afrasiyab, who for that purpose left
        <lb/>Turan and crossing o’er the stream beheaded
        <lb/>Naudar, the noble, with the scimitar
        <lb/>In piteous fashion and o’erturned the state;
        <lb/>And, third, Sikandar who from Rum invaded Iran, laid waste our land, and slew Dara,
        <lb/>The swordsman, so that food and slumber grew
        <lb/>Harsh to the Iranians, while, fourthly, came
        <lb/>Foul Khusnavaz who robbed our fields and fells
        <lb/>Of mirth and joy when unexpectedly
        <lb/>The Haitalians slew Piruz, a Shah high-starred,
        <lb/>The conqueror of the world, the chief of rulers,
        <lb/>And overturned the throne of king of kings.
        <lb/>But none hath seen a wonder such as lately
        <lb/>Came on Iran when Shah Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Fled from the throne, from his own troops, to foes!”
        <lb/>This said, he sat and wept. Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Turned livid at the words. The veteran
        <lb/>Sambaz, loin-girt, with Indian sword in hand,
        <lb/>Leapt to his feet. "This noble paladin,”
        <lb/>He said, “is great, just, ardent, so till one
        <lb/>Of royal race shall come and gird his loins
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1900"/>
        <lb/>'Tis best for him to sit upon the throne,
        <lb/>For he is warlike, brave, and fortunate.”
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina, chief of warriors,
        <lb/>Heard, clapped his hand upon his sword and drew it,
        <lb/>Exclaiming: “If we find within this quarter
        <lb/>A woman of the lineage of the Shahs
        <lb/>I will behead her with the trenchant sword,
        <lb/>And let the breath of death pass over her.<note n="2">Couplet inserted from P.</note>
        <pb n="243"/>
        <lb/>I will not wait for one to claim the realm,
        <lb/>And caracole amidst the cavaliers.”
        <lb/>Whenas the chiefs possessed by Ahriman<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
        <lb/>Heard their foul leader thus assert himself
        <lb/>They drew their scimitars, arose, and spake
        <lb/>In terms unheard till then: "Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Is Shah and we are subjects. We will not
        <lb/>Transgress his wishes and commands.”
        </p>

        <p>
            <lb/>Now when
            <lb/>Bahram Chubina saw the scimitars
            <lb/>Drawn he did what was just and right, and said :—
            <lb/>“If any one shall leave his seat and touch
            <lb/>His scimitar I will cut off his hand
            <lb/>Forthwith and sober him.”
            <lb/>This said, he left
            <lb/>The nobles for the pleasance. That great conclave
            <lb/>Dispersed with faces lined and broken hearts.
            <lb/>Whenas the pitch-hued, star-illumined Veil
            <lb/>Appeared, and watchmen’s calls were heard, he asked
            <lb/>For pen and paper, and a noble scribe,
            <lb/>And wise, approached, to whom he handed pen
            <lb/>And inkstand, saying: “Write out on this silk
            <lb/>This declaration from the Iranians :—<note n="4">Thus imitating the impious Zahhak. See Vol. i. p. 154.</note>
            <lb/>‘Bahram Chubina is the Shah, triumphant,
            <lb/>Deserving crown, adorning throne, and seeking
            <lb/>Right publicly and privily.’ ”
            <lb/>This written
            <lb/>They lighted links and passed an anxious night,
            <lb/>But when the Veil of lapis-lazuli
            <lb/>Had passed away and when the world was sun-gilt,
            <lb/>One fortune-favoured came and set a state
            <lb/>Within the palace of Bahram Chubina;
            <lb/>Upon that golden state they placed a seat,
            <lb/>And oped the court. He took his place as Shah,
            <pb n="244"/>
            <lb/>And donned the royal crown. The scribe then brought
            <lb/>The declaration of his sovereignty
            <lb/>Inscribed upon the costly painted silk,
            <lb/>And each chief testified: “Bahram Chubina
            <lb/>Is monarch of the world.”
            <lb/>When they had signed
            <lb/>He sealed it with his golden seal and said :—
            <lb/>“All-holy God will testify to you
            <lb/>That now this realm is mine and may its kings
            <lb/>Be of my lineage for a thousand years,
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1901"/>
            <lb/>And thus ennobled hold in line direct
            <lb/>The crown and lofty throne.”
            <lb/>'Twas on the day
            <lb/>Khurshid of month Azar that thus the Lion
            <lb/>Gave up the Onager’s back.<note n="5">Mohl has <quote xml:lang="fra">lorsque le lion dévore le dos de l’onagre.</quote> It may mean "When the country (the onager) lost its natural tyrant the lion (Khusrau Parwiz) by the accession of Bahram Chubina.”</note> Bahram Chubina
            <lb/>Thereafter thus harangued the Iranians :—
            <lb/>“Revengeful strife hath risen in our midst.
            <lb/>Whoe’er accepteth not this settlement,
            <lb/>Be he an honest man or not, shall spend
            <lb/>But three days in Iran and on the fourth,
            <lb/>What time the world’s Light mounteth to the sky,
            <lb/>Shall go to join Khusrau Parwiz and sleep not
            <lb/>In our dominions longer.”
            <lb/>Blessing him,
            <lb/>Not from their hearts, men said: ‘May earth ne’er lack thee.”
            <lb/>Heart-broken that Bahram Chubina reigned
            <lb/>Those loyal to the kingdom’s rightful lord
            <lb/>Departed Rum-ward and dispersed abroad.

    How Bandwi plotted with Bahram, the Son of Siyavush, to slay Bahram Chubina, and how Bandwi fled from Bond</head>
    <pb n="245"/>
    <p>
    <lb/>For seventy days Bandwi, like a cheetah bound,
    <lb/>Was in the prison of Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>‘Watched by Bahram, the son of Siyavush—
    <lb/>A most unwilling jailor—whom Bandwi,
    <lb/>Still scheming though in bondage, thus beguiled :—
    <lb/>‘Despair not of the monarch of Iran;
    <lb/>Though night be dark ’twill turn to day and though
    <lb/>His fortune, like the fortune of Piruz
    <lb/>With Khushnavaz, shall tarry long. The Maker
    <lb/>Restored him in the person of Kaikubad,<note n="6">Kaikubad in the original.</note>
    <lb/>And gave him back the world. Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>In like wise will retain not crown and throne.
    <lb/>Doth he himself, this man of fortune, think it?
    <lb/>Nay, perish any rustic who thus giveth
    <lb/>Himself in folly to the wind. Count thou
    <lb/>Two months upon thy fingers and thou'lt see
    <lb/>Troops from Iran in Rum, and they will cast
    <lb/>Fire on this crown and throne, and break the jewels
    <lb/>On this man’s head.”
    <lb/>Bahram said: “If the king
    <lb/>Will grant me quarter I will deck my soul
    <lb/>With thine advice and do thy will in all,
    <lb/>But I must have a great oath sworn to me
    <lb/>By moon, Azargashasp, by throne and crown,
    <lb/>That if Khusrau Parwiz come to our coasts,
    <lb/>And bring a host from Caesar and from Rum,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1902"/>
    <lb/>Thou wilt ask him to spare my life, not slight
    <lb/>What so importeth me, lest he be led
    <pb n="246"/>
    <lb/>By what the Iranians say and harm befall me.”
    <lb/>He spake, then calling for the Zandavasta
    <lb/>He caused Bandwi to swear, who took the roll,
    <lb/>And said: "Let not Bandwi see aught but pain
    <lb/>And toil from the Supreme or e’er find rest
    <lb/>Within this Wayside Hostelry if I
    <lb/>Do otherwise. Else when Khusrau Parwiz
    <lb/>Bestir himself I will not look on him,
    <lb/>Or ever rest, unless he send to thee
    <lb/>Withal a signet and a chieftain’s crown.”
    <lb/>Bahram, on hearing what an oath he swore,
    <lb/>And seeing his pure heart and loyalty,
    <lb/>Said: ‘I will tell thee all my schemes aloud.
    <lb/>I will achieve revenge and set a snare
    <lb/>To catch Bahram Chubina. Where I set it
    <lb/>There will I do mine utmost to destroy him
    <lb/>With bane of scimitar. Our streams are dry
    <lb/>Since we have had to hail him as the Shah.”
    <lb/>Bandwi replied: "Know, O experienced man!
    <lb/>That I am shrewd and prompt and wise, and when
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz returneth with a host
    <lb/>From Rum, and sitteth on the state, thou’lt find
    <lb/>That he will not refuse me anything.
    <lb/>I will ask pardon for thy past offence,
    <lb/>And he would give his crown at my request.
    <lb/>If thou wilt keep thy word and not ensue
    <lb/>Guile in thy heart unfetter me and thus
    <lb/>Begin to recognise Khusrau Parwiz;
    <lb/>‘Twill prove thy secret bent; that plain appeal
    <lb/>Will reach his ear.”
    <lb/>Thereat Bahram’s face brightened,
    <lb/>And he removed the fetters.
    <lb/>When night’s veil,
    <lb/>Musk-hued, turned bright and dawn laid hand thereon
    <lb/>Bahram said to Bandwi: “If my heart fail not,
    <lb/>What time Bahram Chubina playeth polo
    <pb n="247"/>
    <lb/>To-day I have engaged me with five friends
    <lb/>To slay him.”
    <lb/>Calling for a coat of mail
    <lb/>He donned it ’neath his dress and rode away.
    <lb/>Bahram, the warrior, had a wicked wife
    <lb/>Who wished him hewn to pieces. In her heart
    <lb/>She was enamoured of Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>While hatred of her husband filled her soul;
    <lb/>So to Bahram Chubina she dispatched
    <lb/>Someone to say: “O thou that succourest!
    <lb/>Protect thyself because Bahram hath donned
    <lb/>His mail beneath his robe and buckled it.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1903"/>
    <lb/>I know not what may be his ill intent,
    <lb/>But thou hadst better keep aloof from him.”
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing her advice
    <lb/>Not to play polo with her spouse, tapped all
    <lb/>Who came upon the ground with polo-sticks,
    <lb/>And drew anear him, gently on the back
    <lb/>With kindly greetings in a pleasant tone
    <lb/>Until he reached the son of Siyavush,
    <lb/>Found him to be in mail and said: “O thou
    <lb/>Worse than a biting snake! who weareth mail
    <lb/>Beneath his silk upon the polo-ground?”
    <lb/>This said, he drew his vengeful scimitar,
    <lb/>And clave the son of Siyavush in two.
    <lb/>'Twas bruited in the city that Bahram
    <lb/>Was slain, and when the tidings reached Bandwi
    <lb/>The daylight failed him. Putting on his mail
    <lb/>He mounted, quaking girt his warlike loins,
    <lb/>And taking all the kinsmen of Bahram,
    <lb/>With all that looked for safety to himself,
    <lb/>Fled from the city and the Day of Doom.
    <lb/>When they had gone one stage their numbers grew;
    <lb/>They pressed along the road to Ardabil.
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, when he left the ground,
    <lb/>Trailed in his wrath his robe in blood, then ordered
    <pb n="248"/>
    <lb/>Mahrwi to guard Bandwi. The people said:—
    <lb/>“Fret not for him, O king! for when he heard
    <lb/>News of this slaying verily he took
    <lb/>The wind for waymate, knowing that the matter
    <lb/>Concerned himself and that Bahram was slain
    <lb/>For their intrigue. He sorrowed to have caused
    <lb/>His comrade’s death and saw the outlook dark.”
    <lb/>The king said: "May he lack both skin and brain
    <lb/>That knoweth not foe from friend. One will repose
    <lb/>Upon the points of elephants’ tusks, another
    <lb/>Trust to the billows of the dark blue sea;
    <lb/>A third will brave a monarch’s wrath, a fourth
    <lb/>Take lion by the foreleg. Let thy soul
    <lb/>Feel for all four; their fortune is averse.
    <lb/>Another would move mountains and inviteth
    <lb/>All to his aid. He wearieth himself,
    <lb/>And as the outcome clutcheth but the wind.
    <lb/>To voyage in a ship unseaworthy
    <lb/>Is better than to be precipitate,
    <lb/>And if thou seekest and dost find a spring
    <lb/>Wilt thou grow daft and turn therefrom in wrath?
    <lb/>The man whose guide is blind will tarry long
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1904"/>
    <lb/>Upon his way. The handler of a dragon
    <lb/>Would die, the dragon ’scape, while pain and death
    <lb/>Are his who eateth bane for trial’s sake,
    <lb/>And yet I did not slay Bandwi at first,
    <lb/>So he hath schemed and hath escaped my hands!
    <lb/>My act is one for which I needs must weep,
    <lb/>And see what is God’s will.”<note n="7">The import of the speech is: "There are many sorts of fools but I am the greatest of them all.”</note>
    <lb/>Bandwi the while
    <lb/>With his small band sped on like rushing wind.
    <lb/>Each carried with him what he could toward where
    <lb/>Mausil, the Armenian, dwelt along a road
    <lb/>Infested by wild beasts and waterless.
    <pb n="249"/>
    <lb/>Bandwi perceived a camp-enclosure pitched,
    <lb/>Saw that it was Mausil’s, found streams and food,
    <lb/>And hurried forward to that fertile spot
    <lb/>Alone, beheld Mausil, did him obeisance,
    <lb/>And told him privily the case, who said:—
    <lb/>“Stay here, for here the latest news will reach thee
    <lb/>Of what Khusrau Parwiz doth in fair Rum,
    <lb/>And if he contemplateth peace or war.”
    <lb/>Thereat Bandwi was minded to remain,
    <lb/>And called up his companions from the plain.

    How Khusrau Parwiz went toward Rum by the Desert route and how a Hermit told him of the Past and Future</head>
    <pb n="245"/>
    <p>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz led on in haste where guide,
    <lb/>And grass and water, were not. Slack of rein
    <lb/>They went in dudgeon till they reached Babil,
    <lb/>Where all the well-disposed among the chiefs
    <lb/>Went forth to welcome him. As he drew near
    <lb/>He made his men dismount outside the city,
    <lb/>And scarce had done so when a courier came
    <lb/>Out of Iran in haste. He bore a letter
    <lb/>Concealed upon him from Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>And written to the ruler of Babil :—
    <lb/>‘Detain a company if one shall come;
    <lb/>My troops pursue and will arrive anon.”
    <lb/>The ruler, seeing the letter’s purport, sought
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz in haste, who looked and read,
    <lb/>Astounded at the process of the world.
    <lb/>He feared pursuit and mourned his own fatigue,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1905"/>
    <lb/>But mounting presently departed thence,
    <lb/>And girding up his royal loins pressed on
    <pb n="250"/>
    <lb/>Until he came to the Farat; no rest
    <lb/>Saw he in his own realm. His followers,
    <lb/>Both old and young, were famished. Then they spied
    <lb/>A wood and water while a caravan
    <lb/>Of camels led on by a cameleer
    <lb/>Appeared anon. That youth, when he beheld
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, called blessings down upon
    <lb/>That noble one, who asked: "What is thy name?
    <lb/>What is thy trade and whither goest thou?”
    <lb/>He answered: "Kais am I, son of Haris,
    <lb/>And heir of Arab chiefs. From Misr have I
    <lb/>Come with a caravan and am myself
    <lb/>Chief cameleer. I dwell beside the waters
    <lb/>Of the Farat and came thence to this forest.”
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz asked: “What hast thou of food
    <lb/>And stuffs, for we are wearied out and famished,
    <lb/>Not having food or packs?”
    <lb/>The Arab said :—
    <lb/>“Stay; I am one with thee, share, soul, and body.”
    <lb/>In his affection for the Shah he brought
    <lb/>A fatted cow; they slaughtered her and lit
    <lb/>A fire by kindling sticks both green and dry.
    <lb/>He grilled kabab; the comrades of the Shah
    <lb/>Were eager to partake, consuming much,
    <lb/>But had no bread. Each chieftain then made ready
    <lb/>A sleeping-place. They slept awhile, then rose
    <lb/>And offered up their orisons anew
    <lb/>To that just Judge who made the world, made mighty
    <lb/>And weak alike, and then the Shah addressed
    <lb/>His comrades thus: “The most in fault are they
    <lb/>That are my noblest and most famous subjects:
    <lb/>Still those that have done worst, rebelled, and left
    <lb/>God’s way, may trust with confidence to me.
    <lb/>See that ye give to them the fairest hopes.”
    <lb/>His comrades blessed him, saying: "O thou pure
    <lb/>Of heart and Faith! bright be thy heart and jocund
    <pb n="251"/>
    <lb/>Thy lot, and may the just Judge give thee back
    <lb/>The throne. He hath bestowed on thee such Grace
    <lb/>And mien that love and justice are increased
    <lb/>For every one: thou art the sum of wisdom,
    <lb/>For thou replacest ill by good.”
    <lb/>The Shah,
    <lb/>Though pleased at this acclaim, was in his heart
    <lb/>Concerned about his route and asked the Arab :—
    <lb/>“What is it like? How shall I fare with troops?”
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1906"/>
    <lb/>He answered: “Seventy farsangs and more
    <lb/>Of waste and mountain front you. With thy leave
    <lb/>I will find meat and water for the road
    <lb/>If thou wilt hurry not.”
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
    <lb/>Replied: “There is no other course, for this
    <lb/>Will furnish provand and a guide.”
    <lb/>The Arab
    <lb/>Dispatched a cameleer to fare before
    <lb/>The troops. He hurried over waste and mountain,
    <lb/>All care and travail, with that company.
    <lb/>Withal afar another caravan
    <lb/>Appeared upon the route before the troops.
    <lb/>A wealthy merchant sought the king, who asked :—
    <lb/>“Say, whence art thou and whither hastening?”
    <lb/>He said: "I am a merchant and a scribe,
    <lb/>And I have come from Khurra-i-Ardshir.”
    <lb/>“How did thy father name thee?” said the Shah.
    <lb/>The merchantman replied: "Mihran Sitad.”
    <lb/>The king requested of the man supplies
    <lb/>Because the leader of his troops had said :—
    <lb/>“He hath, O Shah! provisions past compute,
    <lb/>But may not be best pleased.”
    <lb/>“To find a host
    <lb/>Upon the way is so much to the good,”
    <lb/>The Shah replied. The merchant loosed his bales
    <lb/>Of cheap and costly wares, brought provand forth,
    <pb n="252"/>
    <lb/>And sat himself upon the ground, invoking
    <lb/>A blessing on the king. The eating done,
    <lb/>The hospitable merchant brought the Shah
    <lb/>The water for his hands, but when Kharrad,
    <lb/>Son of Barzin, saw that he rose, ran up,
    <lb/>Took the warm water from the merchant’s hand,
    <lb/>That no respect toward the Shah might fail,
    <lb/>And when the merchantman made haste to bring
    <lb/>Wine lucent as rose-water then again
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, took from his hand
    <lb/>The goblet and presented it himself.
    <lb/>In due observance servants profit find,
    <lb/>For all such service is repaid in kind.
    <lb/>“Which is the army’s route,” the Shah then asked
    <lb/>The merchant, “and, O hospitable man!
    <lb/>Where dwellest thou in Khurra-i-Ardshir?”
    <lb/>He said: “O Shah! live in prosperity.
    <lb/>I of these traffickers am from Karaz.”<note n="8"><cit><quote xml:lang="la">Je suis le courtier des marchands.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
    <lb/>The Shah enjoined Ruzbih, the scribe, to note
    <lb/>The young man’s name and village. “Go thy ways,
    <lb/>And be at heart the warp and woof of wisdom,”
    <lb/>He said. The army left that verdant spot,
    <lb/>And hurrying toward the Ruman marches reached
    <lb/>The town which Cesar named Karsan. The Christians,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1907"/>
    <lb/>On seeing the troops afar, went hurrying
    <lb/>Across the waste to carry their effects
    <lb/>Within the walls and firmly barred the gates.
    <lb/>The Shah, the lustre of the world, chagrined
    <lb/>Remained outside for three days with his troops,
    <lb/>And on the fourth dispatched a man to say :—
    <lb/>"Our troops are few, send provand, succour us,
    <lb/>And treat us not in this high-handed wise.”
    <lb/>They scorned his words, his troops were weak and famished,
    <pb n="253"/>
    <lb/>When suddenly there rose a murky cloud,
    <lb/>Which roared like some great warrior-lion; a storm
    <lb/>Swept o’er the place; from every quarter came
    <lb/>Din and acry for help. By midnight half
    <lb/>The walls had gone; the town was all amaze;
    <lb/>The bishop offered prayers; in every quarter
    <lb/>They gathered food together, and three priests,
    <lb/>Three venerable men, went forth in haste
    <lb/>With native produce and with Ruman robes,
    <lb/>And brought a led horse to the Shah. They said :—
    <lb/>“Our fault, O Shah! is manifest to us,”
    <lb/>And he, a noble youth, reproached them not.
    <lb/>There was within the city’s walls a palace,
    <lb/>Whose summit was at home among the clouds;
    <lb/>'Twas built by Cesar and had many slaves.
    <lb/>The Shah went thither when he left the plain,
    <lb/>And oft-times used to go about the city.
    <lb/>The Rumans all acclaimed him and strewed jewels
    <lb/>Beneath his feet. Possessed of this fair dwelling
    <lb/>He rested for a while and wrote to Cesar
    <lb/>Of that storm, rain, and darksome cloud, then went
    <lb/>Toward Manwi which he renamed Minu.<note n="9">i.e., Paradise.</note>
    <lb/>The shrewd and wise, the great and powerful,
    <lb/>Among its citizens, with priests and monks,
    <lb/>Went to the king with gifts and offerings,
    <lb/>Spake of the storm and of that ancient town,<note n="10">Karsan.</note>
    <lb/>And all said: “We are slaves and bow before
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz’ behest.”
    </p>

    <p>
        <lb/>He stayed three days,
        <lb/>And on the fourth when Sol, the world’s light, rose,
        <lb/>And thrust its bright sword through the clouds, departed
        <lb/>Toward Warigh;<note n="11">Spelled also Aurigh.</note> it was a city’s name,
        <lb/>And had the true Cross<note n="12">Cf. Vol. v. p. 306 and note.</note> and a hospital.

        <milestone unit="calced" n="1908"/>
        <lb/>Upon the waste he saw a hermitage;
        <lb/>He heard the hermit’s voice, approached, and asked:—
        <lb/>“What blesséd one is here?”
        <lb/>They made reply:—
        <lb/>“An ancient man grown wan with many years,
        <lb/>A skilled astrologer; there is not aught
        <lb/>Concealed from him, and what he saith will be.”
        <lb/>The Shah drew nigh the door forthwith and cried:—
        <lb/>“Be thine to worship God, and may He bless thee
        <lb/>If thou wilt come forth from thine ancient cell.”
        <lb/>Forthwith the hermit, when he heard the words,
        <lb/>Descended from his cell and seeing the Shah
        <lb/>Said: "Of a truth thou art Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Brought by the hand of an ill-doing slave,
        <lb/>Impure, Armenian-like, a servitor,
        <lb/>To this affliction for thy father’s throne.”
        <lb/>He spake at large; Khusrau Parwiz became
        <lb/>Cheered in his heart through all that kindliness,
        <lb/>And all in wonder at the words invoked
        <lb/>The blessings of the Maker on the man,
        <lb/>The devotee, and, mounted, greeted him
        <lb/>With outstretched hand, whereat the man of God
        <lb/>Did reverence and spake long. By way of proof
        <lb/>The Shah said: “Of the Iranian host am I,
        <lb/>A subject, bearing a dispatch to Cesar,
        <lb/>And I shall carry to my lord his answer.
        <lb/>See if my journey will be prosperous,
        <lb/>And how result.”
        <lb/>He answered: “Say not so;
        <lb/>Thou art the Shah, make not thyself a courtier.
        <lb/>I told thee all at sight so never prove me.
        <lb/>Thy Faith alloweth no falsehood, and deceit
        <lb/>Is not thy way and wont. Thou hast endured
        <lb/>Much toil and suffered, and at last hast fled
        <lb/>Before thy slave.”
        <lb/>Astounded and confused
        <pb n="255"/>
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz began to make excuse.
        <lb/>The hermit said: “Forbear, and question me
        <lb/>Of what will be. As to thy coming hither
        <lb/>Be glad and confident, and to the world
        <lb/>A fruitful bough for God will satisfy thee,
        <lb/>And give to thee high fortune and high place,
        <lb/>While thou wilt have from Cesar arms and troops,
        <lb/>And daughter worthy of the crown of state.
        <lb/>The World-lord, who ne’er sleepeth, will assist thee
        <lb/>In battle with thy slaves, while in the end
        <lb/>The miscreant will flee and oft recall
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1909"/>
        <lb/>The days of his success. He will alight
        <lb/>Far from that field of battle and there dwell;
        <lb/>Yet still, though rather than submit to thee
        <lb/>He will choose exile, they will shed his blood
        <lb/>At thy behest.”
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied:—
        <lb/>“God grant it, ancient sage! but tell me this:
        <lb/>Will it be long ere I obtain the kingship?”
        <lb/>He said: “Twelve months and thou wilt have the throne,
        <lb/>Then fifteen days and thou wilt light the world
        <lb/>As king of kings.”
        <lb/>“Who of this company,”
        <lb/>The Shah inquired, “will bear most toil and care
        <lb/>On mine account?”
        <lb/>The hermit said: “Bistam,<note n="13">The Arabic form of Gustaham. He was no true Persian and therefore not to be trusted.</note>
        <lb/>A lofty spirit and a prosperous,
        <lb/>And thy maternal uncle who, thou knowest,
        <lb/>Hath made thy lifetime pleasant; but beware
        <lb/>Of that unprofitable man, the source
        <lb/>Of all thy plaints, affliction, and mishap.”
        <lb/>The Shah was wroth and said to Gustaham:—
        <lb/>"Thy name revealeth thee! Thy mother called thee
        <pb n="256"/>
        <lb/>Bistam but thou proclaimest in the fight
        <lb/>Thyself a Gustaham!”
        <lb/>Then to the hermit:—
        <lb/>“This is mine uncle on my mother’s side.”
        <lb/>The hermit answered: “Yea, it is the same;
        <lb/>Thou wilt see pain and strife through Gustaham.”
        <lb/>“And after,” said the Shah, "what will ensue,
        <lb/>My counsellor?”
        <lb/>He answered: “Heed not that,
        <lb/>For thenceforth thou wilt have but praise; no ill
        <lb/>E’er will befall thee, and if hardship cometh
        <lb/>'Twill be from God. This rebel will disturb
        <lb/>Thy peace, but after thou wilt be content,
        <lb/>And, bad as this malicious one may prove,
        <lb/>His fate is in thy hands.”
        <lb/>“Be not concerned
        <lb/>Hereat, O king!” said Gustaham. “By God,
        <lb/>The Holy One, the Maker of the moon,
        <lb/>Who made a Shah like thee to rule the world;
        <lb/>By sun, by moon, and by Azargashasp,
        <lb/>And by the life and head of our famed Shah,
        <lb/>While Gustaham shall live he shall not seek
        <lb/>Aught but the right or knock at evil’s door;
        <lb/>And if he should be minded otherwise
        <lb/>Then may the soul of Gustaham depart.
        <lb/>No human being since the World-lord made

        <lb/>Through speech of his, and seek not for a pretext

        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz made answer: “Holy men

        <lb/>Speak to the point. Withal I have not seen

        <lb/>Then said he to the hermit: “Be thou glad

        How a Cavalier of Caesar came to Khusrau Parwiz and how Khusrau Parwiz sent a Letter by Gustaham, Badwi, Andiyan, Kharrad, Son of Barzin, and Shapur to Caesar</head>
        <p>
        <lb/>When he arrived there came from noble Caesar
        <lb/>A cavalier to say: "Ask what thou wilt
        <lb/>Within our coasts and see that thou refrain not
        <lb/>Thy will from kings, for though this realm is mine
        <lb/>I hold thee as mine equal. Stay secure,
        <lb/>And happy in yon city, apprehending
        <lb/>No ill. All Romans, haughty though they are
        <lb/>And chiefs, shall serve thee, and I will not seek
        <lb/>Food, sleep or rest till I have furnished thee
        <lb/>With arms and troops.”
        <lb/>The Shah heard and rejoiced;
        <lb/>His soul was eased; he bade call Gustaham,
        <lb/>Badwi, aspiring Andiyan, Kharrad,
        <lb/>Son of Barzin, and lion Shapur, and thus
        <lb/>Spake that brave monarch: “Saddle up at dawn
        <lb/>With golden saddles on the horses led,
        <lb/>Put on your tunics gold-inwoven from Chin,
        <lb/>Be one in heart and honesty, depart,
        <lb/>And parle with Caesar. Be ye wary, shrewd,
        <pb n="258"/>
        <lb/>Attentive, bland, and courteous. If he goeth
        <lb/>Upon the Ground for archery or polo
        <lb/>Exert you to the utmost ’gainst his chiefs,
        <lb/>For ye must not be worsted: let him know
        <lb/>That horsemanship proceedeth from Iran,
        <lb/>While from its Lions there come might and valour.”

        <lb/>The Shah then bade Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
<lb/>“Bring hither silk from Chin and black musk; I
<lb/>Must write a letter like resplendent Sol
<lb/>In jocund Paradise to Caesar, brief
<milestone unit="calced" n="1911"/>
<lb/>But to the purpose, such as all men’s hearts
<lb/>May recollect. He hath philosophers;
<lb/>Be instant that they hear no foolishness.
<lb/>They measure not their words in anything;
<lb/>Let them not find a fault in our dispatch.
<lb/>When he hath read the letter loose thy tongue;
<lb/>None of them can compete with thee in speech.”
<lb/>Then to Badwi: “If Caesar speak of us
<lb/>In public with regard to an alliance,
<lb/>Oath, treaty or affinity, reply
<lb/>As sweet as honey for thou art my tongue
<lb/>Before that folk and mine interpreter
<lb/>For good and ill. Endeavour by all means
<lb/>To save us from defeat; be diligent;
<lb/>Take mine assurances and bear in mind
<lb/>My words.”
<lb/>Those ardent, veteran warriors
<lb/>Heard the instructions of that glorious youth,
<lb/>And blessed him saying: “May none wear the crown
<lb/>But thou.”
<lb/>They fared with cheerful hearts to Caesar,
<lb/>Who when he heard: "Some nobles of Iran,
<lb/>The envoys of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Have reached Yunan,” sent many troops to meet them.
<pb n="259"/>
<lb/>He decked a palace with brocade of Rum,
<lb/>The pattern jewelled on a ground of gold,
<lb/>And sitting on the famous ivory throne
<lb/>Assumed the heart-illuming crown and bade
<lb/>Withdraw the curtain and to introduce
<lb/>The envoys from the vestibule, rejoicing.
<lb/>First came the noble Gustaham, behind
<lb/>There were Badwi and brave Shapur, Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, and valiant Andiyan,
<lb/>All crowned and girdle-girt. They came anear
<lb/>To Caesar and on seeing did obeisance,
<lb/>With one consent called blessings down on him,
<lb/>And on that golden throne besprinkled gems.
<lb/>He first inquired about the Shah, Iran,
<lb/>The host and toilsome journey. Hearing this,
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, approached the throne,
<lb/>And brought the letter of the Shah. They set,
<lb/>By order of that noble sovereign,
<lb/>Four golden seats, and of the envoys three,
<lb/>Men of illustrious rank and well advised,
<lb/>Sat down, but still Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Stood. Caesar said: “A traveller should sit.”
<lb/>“The Shah hath not conferred on me the right,”
<lb/>He answered, “in thy presence while I hold
<milestone unit="calced" n="1912"/>
<lb/>His letter: mine abasement may commend
<lb/>Itself to thee and aid mine embassage.”
<lb/>Said Caesar: “Speak. What said the prudent prince?”
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, what while he spake
<lb/>Observing what Khusrau Parwiz had said,
<lb/>First praised the Maker and besought His help,
<lb/>“Who is above all height, all wise, all mighty,
<lb/>Who hath revealed heaven’s host and given us
<lb/>Soul, wisdom, love. He bade and heaven was,
<lb/>For He is over space and time. The sphere
<lb/>And stars revolving are His work. When He
<pb n="260"/>
<lb/>Created servants out of worthless dust
<lb/>He gave life first to Gayomart. The race
<lb/>Went on to Fereydun whom God most favoured
<lb/>Of all those noble chieftains. Once obscure
<lb/>His stock became illustrious in the world,
<lb/>And lasted up to Kai Kubad who donned
<lb/>The crown of majesty. His race ne’er saw
<lb/>Calamity and ever kept God’s way;
<lb/>But now a worthless slave hath come and sat
<lb/>Upon the royal throne. I seek for justice
<lb/>Against the unjust, not crown, throne, cap, and girdle.
<lb/>Whoever sitteth on a throne hath need
<lb/>Of wisdom, fortune, and nobility.
<lb/>This man shall learn to whom the fortune, Grace,
<lb/>And diadem of king of kings pertain.
<lb/>Help me and quell this traitor for I roam
<lb/>Despised by small and great.”
<lb/>When Caesar heard
<lb/>His cheeks became like bloom of fenugreek;
<lb/>That bloom of fenugreek grew charged with hail,
<lb/>And from his tongue and soul there burst a wail.

<div><head>§15
    How Caesar answered the Letter of Khusrau Parwiz</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>He read, his grief increased, the throne appeared
    <lb/>All mournful<note n="14">Like lapis-lazuli in the original.</note> to his eyes, and thus that world-lord
    <lb/>Said to Kharrad, son of Barzin: “That I
    <lb/>Esteem Khusrau Parwiz above myself,
    <lb/>Above my kindred and my fluent soul,
    <lb/>Is not a secret with discerning men.
    <pb n="261"/>
    <lb/>I have arms, troops, and treasure. Now consider
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1913"/>
    <lb/>What ye require. If he will have mine eyes
    <lb/>I will not say him nay though they are better
    <lb/>Than wealth, dinars, and sword.”
    <lb/>Then Caesar summoned
    <lb/>A well-experienced scribe and, seating him
    <lb/>Upon the royal dais, bade him write
    <lb/>An answer decked like meads of Paradise
    <lb/>With many a counsel, promise, and kind word
    <lb/>About past times and present. When the scribe
    <lb/>Had finished Caesar chose a cavalier
    <lb/>Brave, fluent, ardent, and of heedful mind,
    <lb/>Wise, learned, a warrior, and scribe withal,
    <lb/>And said: “Go to Khusrau Parwiz and say:—
    <lb/>‘Thou seeker of God’s way, shrewd-hearted Shah!
    <lb/>I have men, arms, and treasure, and no need
    <lb/>To trouble any one but, if need were,
    <lb/>Would requisition drachms from every lord
    <lb/>Throughout the realm that thou mightst have thy wish,
    <lb/>And go hence to thine own home in Iran.
    <lb/>Grieve not while here, ’tis circling heaven’s way,
    <lb/>Which is by turns our refuge and our bale,
    <lb/>By turns our loss and profit. While I find
    <lb/>Arms, troops, and money do thou take thine ease.’”
    <lb/>The envoy went and told Khusrau Parwiz.

        How Caesar wrote to Khusrau Parwiz, declining to help him, and his Answer</head>
        <p>
        <lb/>Then Caesar cleared the audience-room and sat
        <lb/>Deliberating with his counsellor,
        <lb/>And said thus to that priest: "This suppliant
        <pb n="262"/>
        <lb/>Hath made choice of ourselves to refuge with:
        <lb/>What shall we do that he may gather strength,
        <lb/>And feel no more his subject’s insolence?”
        <lb/>The counsellor thus answered: "What we need
        <lb/>Is that a few shrewd-hearted men of those
        <lb/>That are our well-advised philosophers
        <lb/>Shall act with us herein.”
        <lb/>So famous Caesar
        <lb/>Dispatched a messenger and four arrived
        <lb/>Of those philosophers, two young, two old,
        <lb/>All Roman-born, and thus they spake at large:—
        <lb/>"The Iranians, since Alexander passed away,
        <lb/>Have deeply wounded us by frequent raiding,
        <lb/>By war and strife, and causeless, reckless bloodshed;
        <lb/>Now holy God requiteth their ill deeds
        <lb/>In kind. Since the Sassanians’ fortune halteth
        <lb/>Forbear to intervene. Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>If he shall gain the royal crown and raise
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1914"/>
        <lb/>His forehead to the moon, will ask for tribute
        <lb/>From Rome anon and trample on our land.
        <lb/>Reflect if this be wise. Hold their words wind.”
        <lb/>When Caesar heard he changed his mind and sent
        <lb/>The Shah a letter by a cavalier
        <lb/>To tell what course the sages had advised
        <lb/>In long debate. He reached Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>And told what he had heard the famed king say,
        <lb/>Delivered Caesar’s letter too and uttered
        <lb/>Words past compute. Khusrau Parwiz grew strait
        <lb/>Of heart thereat, his face turned wan with care.
        <lb/>He thus replied: "If we must lay to heart
        <lb/>All that can be alleged from days of yore
        <lb/>Then all our travail will but catch the wind.
        <lb/>Consider now if my progenitors,
        <lb/>Those chosen world-lords, men of holiness,
        <lb/>Made wars with justice or unjustly; ask
        <lb/>Of ancient men who bear such things in mind.
        <pb n="263"/>
        <lb/>Vouchsafe to question the wise men of Rome
        <lb/>If 'twas the crow or owl that did the wrong.<note n="15">Alluding to a story in the book of Kalila and Dimna (see Vol. vii., p. 382). The owls, having an ancient grudge against the crows, one of whom had prevented the owl from being elected the king of the cranes, made a treacherous night-attack upon the crows. A counsellor of the king of the crows, acting somewhat as an Hephtalite chief is said to have done in the war against Piruz (id. p. 161), succeeded in avenging them.</note>
        <lb/>Although the Maker hath not left in want
        <lb/>The Great of Rome mine ancestors withal
        <lb/>Were men of name, in their own days supreme,
        <lb/>Who were no brookers of insurgency,
        <lb/>Pride, wrong, or foolishness from any one;
        <lb/>But what can this avail now that my head
        <lb/>Is in the dragon’s maw? Greet Caesar for me,
        <lb/>And say: ‘The Great speak only to the point
        <lb/>In wisdom’s presence though both good and ill
        <lb/>Pass in the end. I will not rest till I
        <lb/>Have drawn my skirt forth from this turbid stream,
        <lb/>And if the Romans will not succour me
        <lb/>I will send envoys to the Khan. My words
        <lb/>Have naught availed because my river-bed
        <lb/>Was fouled, and when my messengers return
        <lb/>My sojourn in this city will be short.’”
        <lb/>He said to the Iranians: ‘Obey
        <lb/>My hests; let not this matter break your hearts,
        <lb/>For God, the Conqueror, is aiding us;
        <lb/>Our part is fortitude and manliness.”
        <lb/>He took the matter lightly and dispatched
        <lb/>His answer by Tukhar. He wrote as though
        <lb/>He recked not either good or ill. Tukhar
        <lb/>Departed from Khusrau Parwiz and came
        <lb/>To where was Caesar’s court, that man of name.

            <lb/>The prudent minister, on hearing this,
            <lb/>Gave orders and the readers of the stars
            <lb/>Came with their ancient tablets and consulted
            <lb/>Until three watches of the night had passed,
            <lb/>And in conclusion an astrologer
            <lb/>Spake thus to Caesar: “O illustrious!
            <lb/>I have consulted these old tables made
            <lb/>In astrologic wise by Plato.
            <lb/>Ere long Khusrau Parwiz will have the realm,
            <lb/>The kingship start afresh, and darksome dust
            <lb/>Receive him not for eight and thirty years.”
            <lb/>Thereat said Caesar to his minister:—
            <lb/>“Our doubts are cleared about Khusrau Parwiz.
            <lb/>What shall we say? What answer shall we give?”
            <pb n="265"/>
            <lb/>“Let us apply a salve,” he made reply.
            <lb/>“If he betake him to the Khan’s domains,
            <lb/>Get aid from him, perceive himself secure,
            <lb/>And levy soldiers elsewhere than in Rome,
            <lb/>He never will forgo revenge on thee.
            <lb/>Advise thou who art wiser and more potent
            <lb/>In compassing thy will.”
            <lb/>“We must,” said Caesar,
            <lb/>“Dispatch him troops forthwith. When all is weighed
            <lb/>'Tis well to hold wealth cheap and keep from harm.”
            <lb/>He wrote forthwith, bestowing praise on praise:—
            <lb/>“We have consulted loyal, honest priests
            <lb/>On all points bad and good, and have returned,
            <lb/>Discussion over, to our former view.

            <lb/>All this delay and great deliberation.
            <lb/>This pricking with a fleam the lion’s jaws,
            <lb/>Arose from sages’ tales about the past,

            <lb/>Then passing to Kubad and to Hurmuzd,

            <lb/>Were nine and thirty turned to bramble-brakes

            <lb/>We have convoked the chiefest sufferers,
            <lb/>And spoken much to them in this regard;
            <lb/>Their evil passions have been charmed away,
            <lb/>For gnawing bane hath turned to antidote.
            <lb/>Thus then have we secured that none will use
            <lb/>The language of revenge about the past,
            <lb/>And pledge our lives to further thy commands.

    How Caesar made a Talisman and deceived the Envoys of Khusrau Parwiz, and how Kharrad, Son of Barzin, solved the Mystery</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>When circling Sol grew pale, and in the tower
    <lb/>Of night the stars were stationed, Caesar bade
    <lb/>His warlocks muse and frame a talisman—
    <lb/>A marvel—somewhere, such as none would know
    <lb/>From real—a woman modest, fair, and seated
    <lb/>In trailing raiment on a goodly throne
    <lb/>With handmaids on both sides of her and slaves
    <lb/>Before her and behind. She was to sit,
    <pb n="272"/>
    <lb/>That moon-faced one in silence, to appear
    <lb/>A woman weeping, and from time to time
    <lb/>To raise one hand and dash her tears away.
    <lb/>The warlocks, as they were instructed, made
    <lb/>The semblance of a woman with long hair,
    <lb/>And all that from a distance gazed thereon
    <lb/>Took it to be a woman lovelorn, bright,
    <lb/>That sorely wept o’er Christ, her cheeks aflame,
    <lb/>Her lashes like Spring-clouds. When of the adepts
    <lb/>That talisman was set up in its place
    <lb/>One went and said to Caesar: “We have finished
    <lb/>The matter in accord to what thou badest.”
    <lb/>When he had heard this from the expert, Caesar
    <lb/>Came from his throne in haste and visited
    <lb/>The talisman. He marvelled at that feat
    <lb/>Of sorcery and sent for Gustaham.
    <lb/>He bounteously rewarded those magicians
    <lb/>With money and with divers other gifts,
    <lb/>Then said to Gustaham: "Famed warrior!
    <lb/>I had a daughter beautiful as Spring:
    <lb/>She grew up to a marriageable age.
    <lb/>I had a kinsman, an aspiring one,
    <lb/>To whom I married her with Christian rites.
    <lb/>I countenanced him unadvisedly,
    <lb/>And sent her to his palace. That youth’s soul
    <lb/>Hath gone to Heaven; she is deeply grieved;
    <lb/>Bright day for her is lapis-lazuli;
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1921"/>
    <lb/>She will not take my rede or speak a word,
    <lb/>And our young world hath agéd through her trouble.
    <lb/>Concern thyself to see her, and employ
    <lb/>The words of men of lore, for thou art wise,
    <lb/>A paladin by race, and she may speak
    <lb/>To thee.”
    <lb/>He said: “I will: it may be I
    <lb/>Shall banish this affection from her breast.”
    <lb/>With cheerful heart and charged with potent words
    <pb n="273"/>
    <lb/>That chief approached the guileful talisman,
    <lb/>Which bowed to greet him as he neared its throne.
    <lb/>Illustrious Gustaham sat humbly down,
    <lb/>And spake to that sad dame, beginning boldly
    <lb/>With such advice as seemed to him of profit:—
    <lb/>“O daughter born of Caesar’s race!” he said,
    <lb/>“The wise exclaim not at the course of nature:
    <lb/>The flying eagles, lions in the forests,
    <lb/>And fishes in the waters, are not free
    <lb/>From death,” but all his words were wind; no soul,
    <lb/>Or tongue had she but ever and anon
    <lb/>Would dash away the tear-drops from her eyes
    <lb/>As her physician talked. While Gustaham
    <lb/>Was lost in wonder Caesar summoned him,
    <lb/>And asked: “How didst thou find that child of mine,
    <lb/>Whose pain and mourning cause me this distress?”
    <lb/>He answered: “I advised her much but vainly.”
    <lb/>The following day said Caesar to Balwi:—
    <lb/>“Go thou with Andiyan. Shapur withal,
    <lb/>The nobly born, may help to make my heart
    <lb/>Glad in my daughter. Go to that sorrower,
    <lb/>And speak to her about the famous king.
    <lb/>She that is heaping fire upon my head
    <lb/>May answer thee. Be good enough to aid me
    <lb/>By converse with my mourning child; perchance
    <lb/>In view of your high rank she may accept
    <lb/>Your counsels. Sure I am that she will speak
    <lb/>To-day, and when she maketh fair reply
    <lb/>I shall be freed from this disconsolate,
    <lb/>Who raineth tears of blood upon her breast.”
    <lb/>Then those three noble Persians went to her,
    <lb/>And each one strove, but answer gat they none;
    <lb/>That tongueless dame was mute. The baffled three
    <lb/>Went back to Caesar, that just judge, and said:—
    <lb/>“We spake and gave advice as best we could,
    <lb/>But there was no improvement.”
    <pb n="274"/>
    <lb/>"'Tis ill hap
    <lb/>For us,” he said, “to grieve for one in grief.”
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1922"/>
    <lb/>Since these great men had failed he had recourse
    <lb/>To great Kharrad, son of Barzin. “Thou art,”
    <lb/>He said, “one of these chiefs and thou mayst hear
    <lb/>Her voice forthwith,” then sent him to the mourner
    <lb/>From court attended by a trusty servant.
    <lb/>When he arrived he looked upon the mien
    <lb/>Of that crowned form and waited in its presence
    <lb/>No little while. The guileful talisman
    <lb/>Made him a bow of greeting. He observed
    <lb/>The woman, head and foot, most heedfully,
    <lb/>And marked the attendants standing round. He spake
    <lb/>At large; she answered not a word; that man,
    <lb/>That scion of the chiefs, grew full of thought.
    <lb/>“If grief hath robbed her of her wits,” he said,
    <lb/>“Why do her servants hold their peace the while?
    <lb/>If these be very tear-drops from her eyes
    <lb/>One would expect her passion to abate.
    <lb/>She letteth fall the drops upon her breast,
    <lb/>And knoweth not to move to left or right;
    <lb/>Her tears fall on one spot; she hath not used
    <lb/>One hand or stirred a foot! Had this form life
    <lb/>She would move more than foot or hand, would shed
    <lb/>Her tears, and stretch her other hand, elsewhere.
    <lb/>I see life stir not in her body; 'tis
    <lb/>A talisman of these philosophers.”
    <lb/>He came to Caesar with a smile and said:—
    <lb/>“This moon-faced lady is not rational;
    <lb/>It is a talisman of Roman make,
    <lb/>And hath deceived Balwi and Gustaham.
    <lb/>Thy purpose was to laugh at us or charm
    <lb/>Our eyes. Our Shah when he shall hear will smile
    <lb/>With open lips and show his silvern teeth.”
    <lb/>Said Caesar: “Live for ever! Thou art fit
    <pb n="275"/>
    <lb/>To be the minister of kings. I have
    <lb/>A wondrous chamber in my palace, one
    <lb/>Cannot imagine aught more marvellous.
    <lb/>When thou beholdest it thou wilt not know
    <lb/>Its secret—talisman or work divine.”
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, on hearing this,
    <lb/>Went to that ancient chamber and beheld
    <lb/>A cavalier upstanding, poised in air,
    <lb/>And going back to famous Caesar said:—
    <lb/>“The cavalier is iron and the chamber
    <lb/>Withal is fashioned of the famous ore
    <lb/>Called loadstone by the sages. Those of Rome
    <lb/>Have mounted him upon an Indian steed.
    <lb/>Whoe’er shall read the Indians’ books will find
    <lb/>Both pleasure and enlightenment of mind.”

        How Kharrad, Son of Barzin, expounded the Faith of the Indians and exhorted Caesar</head>
        <p>
        <lb/>“In what regard,” said Caesar, “do the Indians
        <lb/>Err from the Path? Those that are worshippers,
        <lb/>Are they idolaters or what are they?”
        <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, replied: "In India
        <lb/>They worship ox and moon, put not their trust
        <lb/>In God and circling heaven, and regard not
        <lb/>Their persons, look no higher than the sun,
        <lb/>And reckon not men like ourselves as wise.
        <lb/>Whoever kindleth fire, shall enter it,
        <lb/>And shall consume himself therein, believeth
        <lb/>That in the air there is a fire ordained
        <lb/>By God, whose word is law, which fire the sage
        <lb/>Of India entitleth 'Ether' and hath much
        <pb n="276"/>
        <lb/>Of worth and interest to say thereon,
        <lb/>As thus: when earthly and etherial fires
        <lb/>Combine man’s sin is purged; they must be kindled
        <lb/>Since burning is accounted righteousness.
        <lb/>Withal ye too speak not aright; hereto
        <lb/>Christ’s life is testimony. Mark’st thou not
        <lb/>What Jesus, son of Mary, said when he
        <lb/>Was bringing secret things to light? ‘If one
        <lb/>Shall take thy skirt from thee resist him not,
        <lb/>And if one buffet thee upon the face,
        <lb/>So that thine eyes are darkened by the blows,
        <lb/>Be not enraged or let thy cheek turn pale,
        <lb/>But shut thine eyes and speak no chilling word.
        <lb/>If thou hast little food let it suffice,
        <lb/>And if thou hast no carpet seek one not.
        <lb/>Hold not this kind of evil to be bad,
        <lb/>And ye without a pang will quit this Gloom.’
        <lb/>But now with you desire is king o’er wisdom,
        <lb/>Your hearts have erred through overweening greed,
        <lb/>For ye have raised your palaces to Saturn,
        <lb/>And camels bear your treasuries’ keys. Besides
        <lb/>The treasures ye have mighty hosts with coats
        <lb/>Of mail from 'Ad and Roman helms. Ye lead
        <lb/>Hosts everywhere unjustly and allow not
        <lb/>Your swords to rest. The wilderness is all
        <lb/>One fount of blood: Christ led you not to this.
        <lb/>He was a poor, unfurnished man who earned
        <lb/>His bread by toil and lived on curds and milk
        <lb/>With butter for his only other food.
        <lb/>Now when the Jews gat hold of him and saw
        <lb/>Him friendless and without resource they slew him,
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1924"/>
        <lb/>And having slain him set him on the gibbet
        <lb/>To make thereby his Faith contemptible.
        <lb/>His father was an ancient man, his mother
        <pb n="277"/>
        <lb/>A temple-keeper and a trier out
        <lb/>Of good and ill. Grown ardent and desirous
        <lb/>Of knowledge, eloquent, instructed, mindful,
        <lb/>He made withal disciples by his teaching,
        <lb/>And compassed in his youth his will by shrewdness.
        <lb/>Thou sayest that he was God’s son and smiled
        <lb/>When slain upon the gibbet! At such things
        <lb/>The sage doth smile. If thou art wise fear God,
        <lb/>Who hath no need of consort and of son,
        <lb/>And unto whom all mysteries are clear.
        <lb/>Why turn’st thou from the Faith of Gayomart,
        <lb/>The path and precedent of Tahmuras,
        <lb/>Which tell us that the Judge of earth is One,
        <lb/>And that our only course is serving Him?
        <lb/>The experienced thane and worshipper of God,
        <lb/>When muttering prayer he taketh in his hand
        <lb/>The sacred twigs, may taste no drop of water
        <lb/>Albeit for very thirst he dream thereof;
        <lb/>He trusteth God upon the day of battle,
        <lb/>And asketh not cold water in the fight.
        <lb/>Withal he taketh for his cynosure
        <lb/>The highest element which is above
        <lb/>Earth, air, and water. Our Shahs barter not
        <lb/>Their Faith but list to Him, the Lord of all.
        <lb/>They joy not in dinars and gems but seek
        <lb/>To make their name and mark by justice only,
        <lb/>By gifts of lofty palaces or joying
        <lb/>The hearts of mourners. Fourthly, they pronounce
        <lb/>None wise but one that on the day of battle
        <lb/>Doth veil the bright sun’s face with dust and guardeth
        <lb/>The land from foes. Be curses his, not blessings,
        <lb/>That seeketh from religion aught but right.”
        <pb n="278"/>
        <lb/>When Caesar heard this he approved; the words
        <lb/>Seemed profitable to him, and he said:—
        <lb/>“The Maker made thee foremost of the great;
        <lb/>One needs must hearken to thy pure discourse.
        <lb/>Thou hast the key that openeth the door
        <lb/>Of mysteries. The head of one with liege
        <lb/>Like this is higher than the moon’s own crown.”
        <lb/>Then from his treasury he bade to bring
        <lb/>Dinars and drachms and a crown magnifical,
        <lb/>Bestowed them on Kharrad, son of Barzin,
        <lb/>And uttered many praises: "May the country
        <lb/>Of Iran be cultured through thee.”

            How Caesar sent a Host and his Daughter to Khusrau Parwiz</head>
            <p>
            <lb/>Now Caesar, when he heard that troops had come,
            <lb/>And that the world was black with horsemen’s dust,
            <lb/>Chose from those Romans five-score thousand men,
            <lb/>All famed in battle, requisitioned arms,
            <lb/>War-steeds and drachms, and thus much time elapsed.
            <lb/>He had one daughter Maryam hight, wise, grave,
            <lb/>Well counselled and resolved, and later on
            <lb/>Brought forth such stores of bridal bravery
            <lb/>That e’en the speedy baggage-beasts grew slow—
            <lb/>Gold trinkets, jewels that a king might wear,
            <lb/>Gems, gold-embroidered raiment, carpetings,
            <lb/>Brocade of Rome with golden patterns wrought
            <lb/>Upon a ground of silk, torques, bracelets, earrings,
            <lb/>And three most costly and bejewelled crowns.
            <lb/>He had four gilded litters too made ready,
            <lb/>Their curtains decorate with royal gems,
            <lb/>And forty others made of ebony
            <pb n="279"/>
            <lb/>All jewelled like the eye of chanticleer.
            <lb/>Then came three hundred moon-faced waiting-maids
            <lb/>All colour and perfume, five hundred slave-boys
            <lb/>Intelligent and bright with ornaments
            <lb/>Of gold and silver, forty Roman eunuchs
            <lb/>Fay-faced, illustrious, attractive men,
            <lb/>And four of the philosophers of Rome,
            <lb/>Wise, learned and famed. He gave them their instructions,
            <lb/>And privily withal charged Maryam
            <lb/>To be obedient, order her desires,
            <lb/>To do her duty, to be bountiful,
            <lb/>As to her food and how to bear herself.
            <lb/>There was, as reckoned in the Roman way,
            <lb/>More than three hundred millions’ worth of goods.
            <lb/>To every envoy at his court he gave
            <lb/>A crown inlaid with jewels, robes withal,
            <lb/>Steeds and dinars and much of all things fitting.
            <lb/>He bade write to the Shah on painted silk:—
            <lb/>“Well may they raise their necks up to the moon,
            <lb/>These subjects of the Shah! No man more courteous
            <lb/>Than Gustaham hath sprung from small or great.
            <lb/>Is there a champion like the chief Shapur
            <lb/>To act as arbiter? Balwi withal
            <lb/>Can keep a secret for he would not sell
            <lb/>His folk for aught, while none though he live long
            <lb/>Will see one like Kharrad, son of Barzin,
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1926"/>
            <lb/>Whom God created to solve mysteries.
            <lb/>He is as bright and faultless as the sun,
            <lb/>Divine in rede and deed.”
            <lb/>This written, he summoned
            <lb/>His counsellors and readers of the stars
            <lb/>To fix a lucky day for setting forth,
            <lb/>And started on Bahram with favouring stars
            <lb/>And auguries. He went himself three stages,
            <pb n="280"/>
            <lb/>And then resigned the conduct of the host,
            <lb/>Bade Maryam come to him, conversed with her
            <lb/>At large, and said: “Be ware of putting off
            <lb/>Thy girdle till thou comest to Iran.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz must see thee not unveiled
            <lb/>Till then or things unlooked for may befall thee,”
            <lb/>Then bade her tenderly farewell: “May heaven
            <lb/>Protect thee on thy way.”
            <lb/>He had a brother,
            <lb/>The valiant Niyatus, who led his host
            <lb/>In that campaign, and “Maryam is akin
            <lb/>To thee,” he said, “in blood and, I would add,
            <lb/>In Faith. I charge thee with her, with this wealth,
            <lb/>And this well ordered army.”
            <lb/>Niyatus
            <lb/>Accepted all from Caesar who, this said,
            <lb/>Turned back in tears. The host marched toward
            <lb/>Warigh,
            <lb/>Led on by Niyatus with mace and sword.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, on hearing that the host
            <lb/>Had come, set out with forces from that city,
            <lb/>And when the leaders’ dust-clouds and the flags
            <lb/>Of those mailed cavaliers appeared, and when
            <lb/>The troops came onward cloud-like, lapped in iron,
            <lb/>In helmet and cuirass, his heart laughed out,
            <lb/>Like Spring-tide roses, at that fine array;
            <lb/>He plucked up heart and gave his steed the heel.
            <lb/>He saw, embraced, and greeted Niyatus,
            <lb/>And testified his gratitude to Caesar,
            <lb/>Who had endured such toil and with that toil
            <lb/>Of ordering the host had rendered void
            <lb/>His treasury; then going to the litter
            <lb/>Beheld the face of Maryam through her veil,
            <lb/>Saluted her and kissed her hand, rejoicing
            <lb/>To look upon the Fair. He bore her off
            <pb n="281"/>
            <lb/>To his encampment where he gave his Moon
            <lb/>A bower and passed three days in converse with her.
            <lb/>Upon the fourth when Sol, the world’s light, shone
            <lb/>They got in readiness a choice pavilion,
            <lb/>And summoned Niyatus, Sarkab, and Kut,
            <lb/>The bold, with other chiefs both great and small,
            <lb/>Whom thus the Shah addressed: “What chiefs and warriors
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1927"/>
            <lb/>Are here, such men as brandish sword and mace,
            <lb/>In battle reck not of their lives, and turn not
            <lb/>From lion or from leopard in the fray?”
            <lb/>Then Niyatus made choice of seventy men
            <lb/>To lead in fight; each had beneath his banner
            <lb/>A thousand chosen, lance-armed cavaliers.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz beheld this picked array
            <lb/>Of noble horsemen eager for the strife;
            <lb/>He praised the Maker of heaven, time, and earth,
            <lb/>He praised too Niyatus, his troops withal,
            <lb/>And noble Caesar and his realm, and said:—
            <lb/>“If God almighty aid me in this war
            <lb/>I will display my puissance and make
            <lb/>Earth like a sea for jewels; ye shall joy
            <lb/>At having come and rather tell thereof
            <lb/>Than hold your peace: heaven’s airs shall breathe love-fraught
            <lb/>From pleasance, friendship be our only thought.”

            How Khusrau Parwiz led his Host to Azar Abadagan and how Bandwi met him on the Way</head>
            <p>
            <lb/>Upon the seventh day that comely Shah
            <lb/>Arrayed his host as ’twere the turning sky,
            <lb/>The din of tymbals went up from the court,
            <pb n="282"/>
            <lb/>And air grew ebon with the dust of troops.
            <lb/>He chose a force of Persians and set out
            <lb/>Toward Azar Abadagan. There passed
            <lb/>Two weeks what while by order of the Shah
            <lb/>The soldiers concentrated at his camp.
            <lb/>He pitched it on the plain of Dik; the army
            <lb/>Was great and under Roman discipline.
            <lb/>He gave the whole host up to Niyatus,
            <lb/>Thus saying: “Thou art master of the flock,”
            <lb/>And thence with certain valiant cavaliers
            <lb/>Let his swift steed have rein and made toward
            <lb/>Khanjast—an anxious journey—till he reached
            <lb/>Mausil, the Armenian, who could hold his own
            <lb/>Among the great and had with him Bandwi,
            <lb/>The Shah’s maternal uncle. Now these twain,
            <lb/>On hearing that Khusrau Parwiz was stirring,
            <lb/>Sped from the waste to meet him on the way,
            <lb/>Preceding their own troops. To Gustaham
            <lb/>The Shah said, seeing them upon the road:—
            <lb/>“O warrior! two are hurrying o’er the field:
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1928"/>
            <lb/>See who they are and wherefore in such haste.”
            <lb/>He answered: ‘Sure am I, O king! that he
            <lb/>Who rideth on the piebald is my brother,
            <lb/>The brave Bandwi: his friend is not of us.”
            <lb/>The Shah said: “What! How canst thou know him? Nay,
            <lb/>Seek him in ward if living and if slain
            <lb/>Upon a gibbet in the riding-ground.”
            <lb/>Said Gustaham: “O Shah! regard him well
            <lb/>From this side: ’tis thine uncle: let me die
            <lb/>For saying so if it prove otherwise.”
            <lb/>Afoot the twain approached the shady spot
            <lb/>Where was the Shah, praised him and did obeisance.
            <lb/>He gave Bandwi a welcome and observed:—
            <lb/>“I said that I should find thee hid in dust.”
            <lb/>He told the Shah all that had chanced to him,
            <lb/>His ruse of putting on the royal robes,
            <lb/>And all Bahram Chubina’s clemency.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz wept greatly at the tale,
            <lb/>Then asked him: "Who is this?”
            <lb/>“O sun-faced Shah!
            <lb/>Hast thou no kindly welcome for Mausil?”
            <lb/>He answered. “Since thou left’st Iran for Rome
            <lb/>He hath not slept in lands inhabited,
            <lb/>But camped upon the plain, his palace been
            <lb/>Tent and pavilion. The troops with him
            <lb/>Are many; he hath all the gear of greatness,
            <lb/>With drachms and treasures. Now he hath been waiting
            <lb/>Upon the road and longed for thy return.”
            <lb/>“How came it,” asked the world-lord of Mausil,
            <lb/>“That all thy toil was hidden? We will strive
            <lb/>To give thee happy days and make thy name
            <lb/>The greatest of the great.”
            <lb/>Mausil replied:—
            <lb/>“Give me new life, O king! Let me approach
            <lb/>And kiss thy stirrup while I praise thy Grace
            <lb/>And splendour.”
            <lb/>“For these words,’” replied the Shah,
            <lb/>“I will make bright thy gains to pay thy pains,
            <lb/>Will grant thy wish and set thy name on high
            <lb/>Above the great.”
            <lb/>Then he withdrew one foot
            <lb/>Out of the stirrup, and that ardent soul,
            <lb/>All eagerness, kissed foot and stirrup both,
            <lb/>O’ercome by veneration for the Shah,
            <lb/>Who, when that loyal liege was satisfied,
            <lb/>Bade him remount and urged his own steed on
            <lb/>Across that barren waste until he reached
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1929"/>
            <lb/>Azargashasp. With muttered prayer he entered
            <lb/>The Fire-fane, with an aching heart. A priest,
            <lb/>The Zandavasta in his hand, approached
            <pb n="284"/>
            <lb/>The pious Shah who, loosing from his loins
            <lb/>His golden belt, flung jewels on the Fire,
            <lb/>And in his prayers outdid the priest himself.
            <lb/>“Just Judge!” he said, “bring my foes’ heads to dust.
            <lb/>Thou knowest that I justly plead and purpose
            <lb/>To keep the path of good. Approve not Thou
            <lb/>The injustice of the unjust.”
            <lb/>This said, he girt
            <lb/>His golden belt and sought the plain of Dik
            <lb/>With wounded heart in trouble for his way:
            <lb/>Night fell ere he reached camp.
            <lb/>He sent shrewd spies
            <lb/>To learn the posture of the world’s affairs,
            <lb/>And when the army of Nimruz had heard:—
            <lb/>“The Shah, the lustre of the world, hath come,”
            <lb/>They bound the drums upon the elephants,
            <lb/>And earth became as ’twere the river Nile.
            <lb/>All folk at that intelligence, which made
            <lb/>Them young again, drew near to give him aid.

                How Bahram Chubina had Tidings of the Coming of Khusrau Parwiz and wrote to the Chiefs of Iran, and how the Letter fell into the Hands of Khusrau Parwiz and his Answer</head>
                <p>
                <lb/>Bahram Chubina heard: “The Grace of kingship
                <lb/>Hath been revived,” and cast his eyes on one
                <lb/>Devoted to himself, one of the host,
                <lb/>Aspiring, sage, fair-famed—Dara Panah—
                <lb/>Then called a scribe of note whom he instructed
                <lb/>To write him letters of great charge to all
                <pb n="285"/>
                <lb/>The valiant leaders—Gustaham, Bandwi,
                <lb/>Gurdwi, the warrior (for he had won
                <lb/>That name from all the other chiefs), Shapur,
                <lb/>And Andiyan, the cavalier, and all
                <lb/>That were the living memories of the great.
                <lb/>The letters ran: “I offer to the Maker
                <lb/>Mine adoration privily that ye
                <lb/>May all awake from sleep and hasten not
                <lb/>To ill on this wise for from verge to centre,
                <lb/>With this Sasanian race in evidence,
                <lb/>Things worsen through their wrangling and selfseeking.
                <milestone unit="calced" n="1930"/>
                <lb/>Ardshir, sprung from Papak, was first to bring
                <lb/>Confusion on the world, his scimitar
                <lb/>O’ershadowed all his age and mazed the Great;
                <lb/>And first of all I instance Ardawan
                <lb/>With other chiefs of ardent soul whose names
                <lb/>Are lacking on the earth to this throne’s grief.
                <lb/>Then surely ye have heard of what befell,
                <lb/>Through ill-advised Piruz, to Sufarai.
                <lb/>He freed Kubad from fetters and Kubad,
                <lb/>Of all the chieftains, gave him to the wind;
                <lb/>For when malevolent Kubad grew strong
                <lb/>He put away his virtues, took to crime,
                <lb/>Slew this illustrious and devoted man,
                <lb/>And soured the nobles’ hearts. He that aggrieveth
                <lb/>His kin, preferring passion to his child,
                <lb/>Would injure strangers more. No one would look
                <lb/>For ivory in ebony; so put not
                <lb/>Your only trust in the Sasanians,
                <lb/>Or seek for jewels in red willow-trees.
                <lb/>When they shall bring this letter unto you
                <lb/>May your Urmuzd prove gracious. Ye possess
                <lb/>A place illustrious in my regard;

                <lb/>Is one, and when ye join me ye will brighten
                <lb/>My gloomy soul. I reck not of the Romans,
                <lb/>Or of their king, and will tread down their heads

                <lb/>They sealed the letters with his seal,
                <lb/>And then the envoy went in merchants’ guise
                <lb/>In haste to where Khusrau Parwiz held court.
                <lb/>He had a caravan of various goods,
                <lb/>And with the letters carried presents too.
                <lb/>He marked the grandeur and great host wherefore,
                <lb/>Thou wouldst have said: “Earth hath no thoroughfare,”
                <lb/>And thought: “With such a king who will confide
                <lb/>In brave Bahram Chubina? I am Persian,
                <lb/>I carry thirty camels’ loads of goods,
                <lb/>And have no foes; why should I wreck myself
                <lb/>When majesty hath risen from the abyss?
                <lb/>I will deliver to Khusrau Parwiz
                <lb/>The letters—an unlooked for offering.”

                <lb/>Perturbed he reached the Shah’s court with those letters,
                <lb/>And all the presents of that hostile liege;
                <lb/>He brought the drachms, the letters, and the gifts,
                <lb/>Revealing all. The world-lord having read
                <lb/>Assigned the messenger a golden seat,
                <lb/>Assigned the messenger a golden seat,
                <lb/>And said to him: “O man exceeding wise!

                <milestone unit="calced" n="1931"/>
                <lb/>In our regard. Thou hast attained thine end,
                <lb/>But make it not a feather in thy cap.”<note>By boasting of it.</note>
                <lb/>Then sending for a scribe he had an answer,
                <lb/>Such as the case required, drawn up at large:—
                <lb/>“Brave and exalted chief! we have perused
                <lb/>Thy letters and been privy with thine envoy.
                <pb n="287"/>
                <lb/>In word we battle for Khusrau Parwiz,
                <lb/>But sre to thee like new Spring in our hearts.
                <lb/>When thou hast led thine army hither who
                <lb/>Will reck of Rum or Rumans? We will draw
                <lb/>Our scimitars and slay them in the fight.
                <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, when he shall see thine host,
                <lb/>Thy prowess and pre-eminence, will quail
                <lb/>At heart upon the battle-day and flee
                <lb/>Like fox before thee.”;
                <lb/>Having sealed the letters
                <lb/>He gave them to that loyal chief and said:—
                <lb/>"For this thy conduct, sage! thou shalt have fruit
                <lb/>From toil,” then gave him jewels and dinars,
                <lb/>And many precious gems. “Convey,” he said,
                <lb/>“These to Bahram Chubina and recount
                <lb/>What thou hast heard, and thou shalt want for nothing
                <lb/>When my high fortune brighteneth.”
                <lb/>From court
                <lb/>Dara Panah departed and achieved
                <lb/>His journey like the wind. The youth delivered
                <lb/>The letters which the paladin received.
                <lb/>When that aspirant had perused the letter
                <lb/>He summoned greed and banished rede, and led
                <lb/>By what the letters said prepared to march.
                <lb/>The Iranians were amazed. The elders went,
                <lb/>On seeing that blind act, and said: “Depart not,
                <lb/>Or thy young day will age. Khusrau Parwiz,
                <lb/>If he invadeth us, will only find
                <lb/>The maces and the scimitars of war;
                <lb/>But do not thou betray the royal throne,
                <lb/>Or fortune will beguile thee forwardly.”<note>The meaning seems to be: "If you remain on the defensive you may rely on the people supporting you against Khusrau Parwiz backed up, as he will be, by foreign troops; but if you assume the offensive you will throw away this advantage and so betray your own cause.”</note>
                <pb n="288"/>
                <lb/>Their words were vain; he bade the host assemble;
                <lb/>He loaded up the baggage, called to horse,
                <lb/>Struck up the drums, and led the army forth.
                <lb/>That valiant armament of Persians reached
                <lb/>Azar Abadagan. Host drew near host,
                <lb/>And ant and fly were barred from thoroughfare.
                <lb/>That warring subject said: ‘I fain would scan
                <lb/>Yon host and see what Roman cavaliers
                <lb/>Are like, and if their troops are troops or what.”

                <lb/>Then with Yalan-sina and with the chief,
                <lb/>Izid Gashasp, the warriors all mounted
                <lb/>Upon their steeds. These magnates went to view
                <lb/>The hostile host, saw and returning told
                <lb/>Their chief: “Yon host is boundless! The affair

                <lb/>Upon their side
                <lb/>The Roman horsemen of the Shah arrived
                <lb/>In all haste at the place of audience,
                <lb/>And girding up their loins exclaimed: "We long

    How Khusrau Parwiz fought with Bahram Chubina and how Kut, the Riman, was slain</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>When Sol rose o’er the darksome hills the war-cry
    <lb/>Ascended from both hosts; thou wouldst have said:
    <lb/>“Earth is a turning sky and swords eclipse
    <lb/>The sun!” The troops drew up to left and right;
    <lb/>Earth was an iron mountain. At the neighing
    <lb/>Of chargers and the shouting of the hosts
    <lb/>The desert fled for shelter to the hills.
    <pb n="289"/>
    <lb/>When brave Bahram Chubina saw he drew
    <lb/>His glittering glaive, his heart conceived no fears
    <lb/>Though raging lions’ hearts were rent asunder.
    <lb/>He went himself to view the left and right,
    <lb/>And told Yalan-sina: “Take thou the centre,
    <lb/>And keep before the army for I champion
    <lb/>The troops to-day and tarry though they flee.”
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz surveyed the battlefield,
    <lb/>And saw the whole world blackened by the hosts;
    <lb/>The bright sun’s face was like a lion’s maw,
    <lb/>And thou hadst said: “The clouds are raining swords!”
    <lb/>Then Niyatuis, Bandwi, and Gustaham
    <lb/>Went with the Shah from battlefield to height.
    <lb/>Those leaders took their station on Mount Dik,
    <lb/>Their eyes upon their followers, and thence
    <lb/>The Shah surveyed his host, the right and left,
    <lb/>The centre and the wings. The tymbals sounded
    <lb/>From both sides and the eager warriors
    <lb/>Advanced to fight. “Earth is an iron mountain,”
    <lb/>Thou wouldst have said, “heaven lost in foemen’s dust!”
    <lb/>Now when Khusrau Parwiz saw matters thus,
    <lb/>Saw heaven as woof and earth as warp, he prayed
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1933"/>
    <lb/>Thus in the olden tongue: "O Thou more pure,
    <lb/>And higher than the high! who but Thyself,
    <lb/>O holy Judge! can tell which will return
    <lb/>Exulting from the fight to-day? The spear
    <lb/>Of him whose fortune halteth hath but thorn
    <lb/>Or weed for point.”
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was full
    <lb/>Of care, both heart and soul; the world appeared
    <lb/>A brake to him, for from among the troops
    <lb/>Kut, like a dark hill in his iron mail,
    <lb/>Brake from the centre to the height and cried:—
    <pb n="290"/>
    <lb/>“Illustrious monarch! point me out the slave,
    <lb/>The doer of div’s work, ’gainst whom thou foughtest
    <lb/>When in Iran and fleddest while he triumphed.
    <lb/>Look to the army’s left and right, and find him
    <lb/>Among the chieftains. I will teach him warfare,
    <lb/>And show what hearts and might true warriors have.”
    <lb/>Thereat all mindful of the former fight
    <lb/>The Shah was vexed at heart because Kut said:—
    <lb/>“Thou didst let fall thy knightly equipage,
    <lb/>And flee before a slave,” but answered not;
    <lb/>His heart was full, he sighed. At length he said:—
    <lb/>“Approach yon rider on the piebald steed;
    <lb/>He will attack thee when he seeth thee;
    <lb/>Then fly not lest thou bite thy lips in shame.”
    <lb/>Kut sped back like the wind and spear in hand
    <lb/>Came furious as a maddened elephant
    <lb/>Upon the battlefield. Yalan-sina
    <lb/>Called to Bahram Chubina, saying: “Beware,
    <lb/>Brave cavalier! A div armed with a lance,
    <lb/>And with a lasso in his straps, hath come
    <lb/>Like elephant gone mad.”
    <lb/>He heard, unsheathed
    <lb/>Like wind his falchion and proclaimed his name,
    <lb/>Which when the Shah observed he rose and peered
    <lb/>Down from the mountain-top upon the pair,
    <lb/>Wet-eyed and wroth of heart. Now when the Riman
    <lb/>Charged with his lance the aspirant gripped his steed,
    <lb/>Escaped the thrust, raised to his face his shield,
    <lb/>And clave his foe asunder to the breast.
    <lb/>The sword’s clash reached Khusrau Parwiz who laughed
    <lb/>To see the stroke struck by Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>While valiant Niyatus frown-blinded raged
    <lb/>Because the Shah had laughed, and said: “Great sir!
    <lb/>One should not laugh in war whereof thou knowest
    <pb n="291"/>
    <lb/>Naught but the sleights, and when thou wouldst avenge
    <lb/>Thine ancestors I see thy heart asleep.
    <lb/>Men will not see in any peopled part
    <lb/>Of Rum or of Iran one like to Kut,
    <lb/>Hazara’s son, whose slaying made thee laugh.
    <lb/>Know this, that fortune hath deserted thee.”
    <lb/>He made reply: ‘I laugh not at his slaughter,
    <lb/>Or at his body which is cleft in twain.
    <lb/>'Know this that he who mocketh shall receive
    <lb/>Himself a buffet from the turning sky.
    <lb/>He said to me: ‘Thou fleddest from a slave
    <lb/>With whom thou hadst not prowess to contend.’
    <lb/>But fleeing from this slave who striketh blows
    <lb/>In such wise in the battle is no shame.”
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina for his part exclaimed:—
    <lb/>“Ye chiefs of glorious birth—Yalan-sina,
    <lb/>Ram and Izid Gashasp! bind ye the slain
    <lb/>Upon his charger and thus send him back
    <lb/>To his own camp for their own Shah to see.”
    <lb/>They hasted to secure upon the saddle
    <lb/>The corpse of Kut, and then the charger sped
    <lb/>Back to the camp with that exalted chief.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was grieved at heart for Kut.
    <lb/>They loosed the knotted lasso from the slain,
    <lb/>Then by the Shah’s direction dried the body,
    <lb/>And having filled with musk and stitched the wounds,
    <lb/>Sewed up the corpse in linen and dispatched it,
    <lb/>All armed and girded, unto Cesar, saying:—
    <lb/>“If this infernal slave can give such blows
    <lb/>In time of battle with his scimitar
    <lb/>I am not shamed for having fled from him.”
    <lb/>The Rumans were heart-broken ere they fought,
    <lb/>And sorely stricken; their patricians wept;
    <lb/>They all were tearful and dispirited.
    <lb/>Ten thousand of the mighty men advancing
    <pb n="292"/>
    <lb/>All prelates, warriors, and cavaliers,
    <lb/>Charged so that hills split at the cry of them.
    <lb/>The clash of arms, the shoutings of the chiefs,
    <lb/>The blows of scimitar and massive mace,
    <lb/>Rose. Thou hadst said: “It is a raging sea,
    <lb/>And heaven as it turneth crieth ‘Blood.’”
    <lb/>The hosts were blocked and sundered by the slain;
    <lb/>An army of those Ruman chiefs had fallen.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was stricken to the heart,
    <lb/>And had the wounds of those still living dressed.
    <lb/>They piled the corpses mountain-high; men called it
    <lb/>"The harvest of Bahram.” Khusrau Parwiz
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1935"/>
    <lb/>Lost faith in Rumans for he said: ‘If they
    <lb/>Bear them like this again know that their host
    <lb/>Will cease to be and all their swords of steel
    <lb/>Prove merely wax.”
    <lb/>Then said he to Sarkab:—
    <lb/>“Tomorrow take no Rumans to engage:
    <lb/>But rest and I will lead the Iranian host
    <lb/>To battle.”
    <lb/>To the Iranians he said:—
    <lb/>“No more delay; tomorrow ye must fight,”
    <lb/>And one and all replied: “We will not fail
    <lb/>To level to the plain mount, waste, and dale.”
