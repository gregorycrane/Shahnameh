<div><head>PART V. THE FALL AND RESTORATION TO FAVOUR OF BUZURJMIHR, AND THE WISDOM OF NUSHIRWAN</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="argument"><head>Argument</head>

<p><pb n="8.3"/>Buzurjmihr, while in attendance upon the Shah during a hunting-expedition, has a premonition of coming trouble and immediately afterwards falls under the Shah’s displeasure, and is disgraced. Conscious of his own rectitude he refuses to own that he is in fault and is treated with increasing rigour till the Shah has need of his services to expound a problem proposed by Caesar, but with his sight greatly impaired by his sufferings.</p>

<p>The rest of the Part is taken up with an account of the wisdom of Nushirwan as shown in his replies to questioners and in his letter of advice to his son Hurmuzd.</p>

<p>§4. It is manifest from the account in the Shahnama, and it is probably true historically, that Nushirwan did his best to provide himself with a worthy successor.<note n="1">Cf.

<p><pb n="8.4"/><milestone unit="calced" n="1751"/>
<lb/>Consider now the case of Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Who from the dust rose to the circling sphere,
<lb/>Which will exalt one to the clouds on high,
<lb/>Then bring him down in sorry dust to lie <note n="1">Two couplets omitted.</note>
</p><p>
<lb/>It happened in those days that Nushirwan
<lb/>Went forth from Mada’in to hunt. He chased
<lb/>Along the wilderness the mountain-sheep
<lb/>And the gazelles. The mountain-sheep dispersed.
<lb/>The Shah was left behind with Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Who followed both from duty and from love.
<lb/>Then from the waste the monarch reached a meadow,
<lb/>And saw trees, grass, and shade. The weary Shah
<lb/>Alighted from his steed to rest his eyes
<lb/>Upon the grass. He saw no followers ;
<lb/>The one of goodly face remained, no more.
<lb/>The Shah reposed awhile upon the mead,
<lb/>His head right lovingly upon the lap
<lb/>Of Buzurjmihr. It was that wise king’s wont
<lb/>To wear a jewelled armlet. As it chanced
<lb/>This clinging armlet snapped upon his arm,
<lb/>And fell beside his couch. A sable bird
<lb/>Swooped from the clouds to where he lay, looked round,

<lb/>Beheld that armlet, brake the thread whereon
<lb/>The gems were strung, then ate them each in turn,
<lb/>The lustrous pearls and topazes alike,
<lb/>Flew from the monarch’s couch, and disappeared.
<lb/>At that adventure Buzurjmihr aghast
<lb/>Mused at the process of the turning sky.
</p><p>
<pb n="8.5"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>He understood: <q>My fall, my day of wrath,
<lb/>My season of dismay, are hard at hand!</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah awoke, marked how he bit his lips,
<lb/>Scanned his own arm, beheld the jewels gone,
<lb/>And seeing no one of his escort there<note n="2">Couplet inserted from P.</note>
<lb/>Conceived that while he slumbered Buzurjmihr<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Had gulped the armlet down, and said to him:—
<lb/><q>Thou dog! who said to thee: <q>’Tis possible
<lb/>To hide one’s natural bent?</q></q><note n="4">Couplet omitted.</note>
</p><p><milestone unit="calced" n="1752"/>
<lb/>But Nushirwan

<lb/>Fatigued with many words his tongue in vain;
<lb/>He got no answer but a deep, cold sigh,
<lb/>While Buzurjmihr stood withered by the Shah,
<lb/>And by the process of revolving heaven.
<lb/>That wise man marked at once the ominous sign
<lb/>Of downfall and remained struck dumb by fear.
<lb/>The escort of the Shah had gone about
<lb/>The mead while Nushirwan was in its midst.
<lb/>He mounted on his charger’s back in wrath,
<lb/>And noticed no one on his journey home,
<lb/>But bit his lip at Buzurjmihr the while,
<lb/>And muttering much alighted from his steed,
<lb/>Bade smite the sage’s face as ’twere an anvil,
<lb/>And to imprison him in his own palace.
<lb/>So Buzurjmihr abode there and beheld
<lb/>A frowning sky. He had a kinsman, brave
<lb/>And young, attending on Shah Nushirwan
<lb/>Within the palace day and night on terms
<lb/>Of intimacy. Buzurjmihr one day
<lb/>Asked that dependant of the sun-faced Shah:—
<lb/><q>How dost thou wait upon him? Let me know
<lb/>So that thou mayest be more serviceable.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><q>Chief of archmages!</q> said the servitor,
<lb/><q>It chanced this very day that Nushirwan


<pb n="8.6"/>

<lb/>Looked so on me, his bondslave, that I said:—
<lb/><q>There is an end for me of food and sleep!</q>
<lb/>I poured the water for him after meat,
<lb/>Transgressing with the basin in the act,
<lb/>And when the world-lord was offended at me
<lb/>I let the basin fall.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then said the sage:—
<lb/><q>Arise! Fetch hither water and pour out
<lb/>As thou wouldst pour it o’er the Shah's own hands.</q>
<lb/>The young man brought warm water which he poured
<lb/>Upon the sage’s hands with gentleness,
<lb/>Who said: <q>Pour thus when he requireth it,
<lb/>Avoiding any awkwardness, and when
<lb/>The water shall perfume the basin’s brim
<lb/>Forbear to pour.</q>
<lb/>The servitor took heed,
<lb/>And on the next occasion, when he brought
<lb/>The salver, poured the water as the sage
<lb/>Enjoined with neither tardiness nor haste.
<lb/><q>O thou whose love increaseth!</q> said the Shah,
<lb/><q>Who told thee this?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>For he it was that taught to me the mode
<lb/>Marked by the Shah, the master of the world.</q>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Go and say thus to the sage:—
<lb/><q>With all that high estate of thine and lustre
<lb/>Why didst thou seek the worse and not the better
<lb/>Through thine ill nature and misgovernance?</q></q>
<lb/>The attendant heard and coming quickly sought
<lb/>The palace eagerly with stricken soul,
<lb/>Gave Buzurjmihr the message of the Shah,
<lb/>And privily received this answer back:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1753"/>
<lb/><q>My station both in public and in private
<lb/>Far bettereth the monarch of the world’s.</q>
</p><p>
<pb n="8.7"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>The servitor returned with this response,
<lb/>But counted as he went the grains of dust.
<lb/>The answer made the Shah exceeding wroth.
<lb/>He had the sage bound in a dismal dungeon,
<lb/>And asked the servitor the second time:—
<lb/><q>How beareth that insensate one his lot?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The messenger came with a tearful face,

<lb/>And told the words to Buzurjmihr who thus
<lb/>Made answer to that faithful friend of his:—
<lb/><q>My days are passed more lightly than the Shah’s.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The messenger turned back, came like the wind,
<lb/>And told the Shah that answer, which enraged him;
<lb/>He was as ’twere a pard and bade to make
<lb/>A narrow iron cage, then studded it
<lb/>With spikes and nails inside, and set thereon
<lb/>Withal an iron lid. Thus Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Could neither rest by day nor sleep by night.
<lb/>Thus for the fourth time to the servitor
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Take this message and bring back
<lb/>His answer. Say to him: <q>How far’st thou now,
<lb/>Environed as thou art by piercing nails?</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The attendant came and gave the message sent
<lb/>By that imperious prince. Thus Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Made answer to the youth: <q>My days are better
<lb/>Than those of Nushirwan.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Now when the man
<lb/>Returned with this reply the Shah’s face grew
<lb/>All livid at the words. Out of the palace
<lb/>He chose a truthful man and capable
<lb/>Of comprehending what the sage should say,
<lb/>Dispatched too with the messenger a swordsman,
<lb/>Who acted as the executioner,
<lb/>And said: <q>Go to this bad, ill-fortuned man,
<lb/>And say: <q>If thy reply give pleasure, well;
<lb/>If not the deathsman with his trenchant sword
<lb/>Shall show thee Doomsday in that thou hast said

<pb n="8.8"/>
<lb/>That jail and nails and cage, and pit and bonds
<lb/>Are better than the throne of Nushirwan.</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The envoy came apace to him and told
<lb/>The words of Nushirwan. Said Buzurjmihr
<lb/>To that good envoy: <q>Fortune ne’er hath shown us
<lb/>Its face. None of us is exempt from change,
<lb/>And verily all good and ill will end.
<lb/>Enthroned and rich or grievously oppressed,
<lb/>We have no choice, we all must pack and part.
<lb/>To pass from durance is an easy thing;
<lb/>The quaking is for them that wear the crown.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>That wise man and the executioner
<lb/>Returned and, coming to the exalted Shah,
<lb/>Narrated everything that they had heard.
<lb/>The fear of evil fortune came upon him.
<lb/>They bore that righteous guide from that strait cage
<lb/>Back to his palace with the Shah’s consent,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1754"/>
<lb/>And heaven turned awhile with matters thus,
<lb/>While wrinkles filled the face of Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>His heart grew more oppressed and worn, and both
<lb/>His eyes were darkened by anxiety,
<lb/>While since his travailing surpassed his gain
<lb/>He wasted with his care and pined with pain.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How the Ambassador of Caesar came to Nushirwan with a locked Casket and how Buzurjmihr was set at large to declare its Contents</head>
<p>
<lb/><pb n="8.9"/>Now in those days it chanced that Caesar sent
<lb/>An envoy with a letter to the Shah,
<lb/>With gifts, with presents, and a padlocked casket,

<lb/>And said: <q>O king of warriors and chiefs!
<lb/>Thou hast no lack of holy archimages,

<lb/>So let them tell, not tampering with the lock,
<lb/>What is concealed therein. If they say right
<lb/>We will send tribute and our wonted gifts;
<lb/>But if thy clever archimages’ hearts

<lb/>Fail in this knowledge indispensable
<lb/>The Shah must not ask tribute at our hands,
<lb/>Nor send an army to invade our realm.

<lb/>Such is the message that hath come from Caesar:
<lb/>Make answer as it seemeth good to thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The monarch of the world said to the envoy:—
<lb/><q>This thing is not a mystery to God,

<lb/>And by His Grace divine I will achieve it,
<lb/>Convoking holy men to give me aid.
<lb/>Abide here for a se’nnight, cheered with wine,
<lb/>Make merry in thy heart and be at ease.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The matter proved perplexing to the Shah:
<lb/>He called to him the great men and the wise,
<lb/>Who all examined it in every way
<lb/>To find a means whereby to loose that coil,
<lb/>Examined, as did all the archimages,

<lb/>That casket and that lock whose key was lacking,
<lb/>But could not tell and owned their ignorance.
<lb/>Now when that concourse proved of no avail

<lb/>The heart of Nushirwan, the Shah, was grieved.
<lb/>He said: <q>The intellect of Buzurjmihr

<lb/>Will search this secret of the turning sky.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The king of kings, in sore embarrassment,
<lb/>Gave orders to his treasurer to provide
<lb/>A change of raiment from the treasury,

<lb/>And had a choice steed saddled royal wise.
</p><p>
<lb/>He sent them to the sage. <q>Thou must forget,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>the hardships that thou hast endured
<lb/>Because high heaven above us so ordained

<lb/>That thou shouldst have affliction at our hands.
<lb/><pb n="8.10"/>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1755"/>
<lb/>Thy tongue excited my displeasure: thou
<lb/>Hast been the author of thine own oppression.
<lb/>I am confronted with a thankless task,
<lb/>The elders’ hearts have been perplexed thereby,
<lb/>For Caesar hath dispatched to us from Rum
<lb/>A famed priest of that land and therewithal
<lb/>A casket with a tightly fastened lid
<lb/>Padlocked and sealed with musk. The envoy saith:—
<lb/><q>Thus said my lord: <q>Reveal this hidden thing,
<lb/>And let the sages and the princes say
<lb/>What lieth in this casket.</q></q> So methought:—
<lb/><q>No one will see through this veiled mystery
<lb/>Unless it be the soul of Buzurjmihr.</q></q>
<lb/>When Buzurjmihr had listened to those words
<lb/>His pain and former trouble were renewed;
<lb/>He left the prison, bathed his head and body,
<lb/>And first approached in prayer the Lord of all.
<lb/>Albeit innocent himself he feared
<lb/>The Shah, the wrathful world-lord’s, tyranny.
<lb/>He watched that day and night alike and pondered -
<lb/>According to the message of his master.
<lb/>What time the sun was brilliant in the heavens
<lb/>He mused upon the aspects of the stars,<note>Couplet omitted and reading with P.</note>
<lb/>He laved his heart’s eyes in the stream of wisdom,
<lb/>Chose out a trusty man among the sages,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>My market hath been spoiled,
<lb/>My vision ruined by my sufferings.
<lb/>Observe upon the road the passers by,
<lb/>Address them, have no fear, and ask their names.</q>
<lb/>Forth from his house went Bazurjmihr and met
<lb/>A woman hasting, beautiful of face.
<lb/>That wise man vigilant informed the sage
<lb/>Of all things that were hidden from his eyes,
<lb/>And he as feeling for his way rejoined:—
<pb n="8.11"/>
<lb/><q>Ask if this Moon be wedded.</q>
<lb/>Said the lady:—
<lb/><q>I have a spouse and child withal at home.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The sage on his white roadster, when he heard
<lb/>Her answer, started. Then another woman
<lb/>Appeared and, seeing her, his agent asked:—
</p><p>
<lb/><q>O woman, hast thou got a child and spouse,
<lb/>Or, being single, only wind in hand?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/><q>I have a husband if no child,</q> she said,

<lb/><q>Thou hast mine answer, suffer me to pass.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Just then another woman came—the third.
</p><p>
<lb/>Her too the friend approached. <q>My Fair!</q> said he,
<lb/><q>What mate hast thou who hast such goodly carriage
<lb/>And daintiness?</q>
<lb/><q>I never had a husband,</q>
<lb/>She said, <q>I would not one should see my face.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Now mark the inference of Buzurjmihr
<lb/>On hearing these replies. He hurried on
<milestone unit="calced" n="1756"/>
<lb/>With anxious mien. They brought him to the Shah,
<lb/>Who ordered that he should approach the throne,
<lb/>But was exceeding troubled in his heart
<lb/>Because he missed the sage’s piercing glance,

<lb/>And heaved full many a deep and chilling sigh,
<lb/>Excused himself for having wronged the guiltless,
<lb/>Then talked of Caesar and of Rum, and spake
<lb/>Of casket and of padlock. Buzurjmihr

<lb/>Made answer to the monarch of the world:—
<lb/><q>Be lustre thine so long as heaven shall turn.
<lb/>Now must we hold a session of the wise,

<lb/>Of Caesar’s envoy, and the archimages,

<lb/>And have the casket laid before the Shah,
<lb/>Before the Great, the seekers of the way;
<lb/>Then in God’s strength, who gave me intellect,
<lb/>And made the right the business of my soul,

<lb/>I will declare the casket’s whole contents,
<lb/><pb n="8.12"/>
<lb/>And lay no hand on it or on its lock.

<lb/>Although mine eyes be dim my heart is bright;

<lb/>The breastplate of my soul withal is knowledge.</q>
<lb/>The king joyed at the words. His heart grew fresh
<lb/>As roses in the Spring. Anxiety

<lb/>Bent him no longer, and he called for envoy
<lb/>And casket, summoned all the archimages
<lb/>And mighty men, and seated many a sage
<lb/>With Buzurjmihr, then told the ambassador:—
</p><p>
<lb/><q>Repeat thy message and demand an answer.</q>
<lb/>The Ruman, hearing, loosed his tongue and thus

<lb/>Told Caesar’s words: <q>From the victorious world-lord
<lb/>We look for wisdom, knowledge, and renown,
<lb/>And thou, O master of the world! hast Grace,
<lb/>And stature, greatness, lore, and might of hand.

<lb/>The wise archimages—seekers of the way—
<lb/>The chiefs and heroes that attend upon thee,
<lb/>Are either all assembled at thy court,
<lb/>Or are thy lieges still where’er they be.

<lb/>If these shrewd-hearted sages shall behold
<lb/>This casket with its lock and seal and stamp,
<lb/>And state distinctly what is there concealed,
<lb/>So that their statement shall accord to wisdom,
<lb/>Then by this token I will send to thee
<lb/>The tribute that my realm can well afford;
<lb/>But if in any wise they fail herein
<lb/>Ask not for tribute from our land again.</q>
<lb/>Whenas the sage had heard the speaker’s words

<lb/>He loosed his tongue and offered praise and said:—
<lb/><q>Oh! be the world’s Shah Shah for evermore,
<lb/>May he be eloquent and fare with fortune!

<lb/>Praise to the Master of the sun and moon,
<lb/>Who showeth to the soul the path to knowledge,
<lb/>And knoweth all things manifest and hidden;
<lb/><pb n="8.13"/>
<lb/>I covet knowledge, He is past all need.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1757"/>

<lb/>Within the casket are three lustrous pearls,

<lb/>And greater coverture than I have said.<note>Reading with P.</note>

<lb/>One pearl is pierced, the second is half pierced,
<lb/>The third hath had no intercourse with iron.</q>
<lb/>The Ruman sage, on hearing, brought the key

<lb/>To Nushirwan who looked. Concealed within
<lb/>There was a pyx, and in the pyx a veil
<lb/>Of painted silk, and in the silk three jewels,
<lb/>Just as the wise man of Iran had said,

<lb/>Because of those three gems the first was pierced,
<lb/>The second half pierced and the third intact.
<lb/>Then all the archimages praised the sage
<lb/>And showered gems on him. The king of kings
<lb/>Became of joyful countenance and filled

<lb/>The mouth of Buzurjmihr with lustrous pearls.
<lb/>His conduct in the past oppressed his heart,
<lb/>He writhed, his face grew furrowed: why had he
<lb/>Dealt so oppressively with Buzurjmihr
<lb/>From whom he had experienced love and faith?
</p><p>
<lb/>The sage, when he beheld the Shah’s shrunk face,
<lb/>And grief-pierced soul, revealed what had been hidden,
<lb/>Declared all that had passed to Nushirwan,
<lb/>Told of the armlet, of the sable bird,
<lb/>The liege’s care, the slumber of the Shah,
<lb/>And added: <q>This was doomed to come to pass,
<lb/>And sorrow and remorse will profit not.
<lb/>When heaven is intending good or ill
<lb/>What are Shah, archimage, or Buzurjmihr?
<lb/>God hath implanted in the stars the seed,
<lb/>And we must write the sentence on our heads;
<lb/>So let the heart of Nushirwan, the Shah,
<lb/>Rejoice exempt from pain and grief for ever.
<lb/>Exalted though the Shah be yet his state
<lb/><pb n="8.14"/>
<lb/>Is made more gracious by his minister.
<lb/>The chase, war, pleasure, largess, justice, feast,
<lb/>These are the business of the king of kings.
<lb/>He knoweth what Shahs did in days of yore,
<lb/>So by that token let him do the same.
<lb/>To gather treasure, to provide the host,
<lb/>To chide, speak, hear the suppliant, and take thought
<lb/>For rule and treasure, these things are a care,
<lb/>That, heart and soul, the minister must bear.</q></p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>Discourse on the Responses of Nushirwan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thus was it at the time of Nushirwan:

<lb/>He was at once the Shah and paladin,

<lb/>At once a warrior and archimage,

<lb/>The Fire-priest and the captain of the host.
</p><p>
<lb/>He had his emissaries everywhere,

<lb/>And trusted not the world to ministers.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1758"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>None could conceal from him in great or small

<lb/>The good and evil of the world’s estate.
<lb/>One day a loyal archmage of his agents

<lb/>Took on himself to put this to the Shah:—
</p><p>
<lb/><q>One time without reproof thou passest by

<lb/>A fault. Another time the same offender

<lb/>Is hung howe’er much he excuse himself!</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>When one doth own his fault

<lb/>I am as leech, he is as wretched patient

<lb/>That would avoid the dose and sheddeth tears;

<lb/>If that dose fail I leech his soul no more.</q>
<lb/>Another archmage said to him: <q>Be blest,

<lb/>And sheltered from all ill on every side!
<lb/><pb n="8.15"/>

<lb/>The captain of the host went from Gurgan

<lb/>With privacy, and entering a wood.
<lb/>There for a while he slumbered. The Gurkils

<lb/>Bore off his baggage! He was left unfurnished,

<lb/>And, further, turneth back on that account!</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer thus: <q>We do not need

<lb/>That militarist. How can he guard troops

<lb/>Who cannot guard himself?</q><note>Mohl translates: <quote xml:lang="fra">Le Sipehbed est sorti un jour de Gourgan en secret, est entré dans un bois et y a dormi pendant quelque temps ; ses bagages étaient sur un autre steppe, il n’avait rien avec lui et fut obligé de s’en revenir pour rejoindre ses bagages.</quote> Nouschirwan répondit par cette sentence: <quote>Je n’avais pas besoin d’une escorte ; celui qui veille sur l’armée ne s’inquiète pas pour lui-même.</quote></note>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/><q>Live happy evermore with archimages

<lb/>To sit, to banquet, and repose with thee!
<lb/>There is a famous chieftain present here,

<lb/>Whose treasure passeth thine!</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied:—
<lb/><q>Yea, rightly, for he is our empire’s crown.
<lb/>I tender both his treasures and his life,

<lb/>And toil to magnify him.</q>
<lb/>Said another:—
<lb/><q>Great king! live ever and unscathed by ill!

<lb/>Among the captives carried off from Rum
<lb/>Are many babes unweaned.</q>
<lb/>He gave this sentence:—
<lb/><q>The little ones must not be reckoned captives.
<lb/>We will dispatch them glad and in good case
<lb/>To their own mothers.</q>
<lb/>People wrote to him:—
<lb/><q>A hundred wealthy Rumans offer ransom.</q>
<lb/><q>If they are doing it through fear,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>‘Sell each chief for a cup of wine and ask
<lb/>No more because we do not lack their goods.
<lb/>I will require their jewels, purses, slaves,
<lb/><pb n="8.16"/>
<lb/>And gold and silver with the scimitar.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>They told him: <q>Of the rich men of the city
<lb/>There are two merchants and they keep folk waking
<lb/>The best part of the night with shouts of revel,
<lb/>And twanging of the rebeck and the harp.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He made them this reply: <q>No hardship this,
<lb/>And do ye others that are wealthy too
<lb/>Live like these twain in mirth and jollity;
<lb/>Be inoffensive and live unaggrieved.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1759"/>
<lb/>One day they wrote to him: <q>Mayst thou be happy!

<lb/>Far from thee ever be the evil eye!
<lb/>The monarch of Yaman observed at court:—
<lb/><q>When Nushirwan doth ope his mouth to speak
<lb/>He talketh so much of the dead that those
<lb/>Alive have their glad lives made sad thereby!</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>All wise and high-born men
<lb/>Speak of the dead: the friendship is not sound
<lb/>Of any that would purge the heart of them.</q>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah! thy youngest son
<lb/>Doth act not with the justice of his sire.

<lb/>He buyeth an estate at such a rate
<lb/>As to aggrieve the seller!</q>
<lb/>Said the Shah:—
<lb/><q>This is not well, so let the seller keep
<lb/>Both price and land.</q>
<lb/><q>O Shah,</q> another said,
<lb/><q>Imperious, far from blame and from reproach!
<lb/>Thy heart was gentle once: why hath it grown
<lb/>So overbearing and so choleric?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>I had no teeth then,
<lb/>And fed on milk because I could no other,

<lb/>But since my teeth came, and my back grew straight,
<lb/>My quest is flesh because I have grown strong.</q>
<lb/>Another said: <q>I own that thou art mighty,
<lb/><pb n="8.17"/>
<lb/>Our better both in counsel and in knowledge,
<lb/>But how hast thou surpassed the kings of kings,
<lb/>And made the whole world watch thy policy?</q>
<lb/><q>My wisdom is a thing,</q> he thus replied,
<lb/><q>That is beyond their ken. Sense, knowledge, counsel—
<lb/>These are my ministers, my treasury
<lb/>Is earth, my treasurer thought.</q>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/><q>O king! thy hawk in chase hath bound an eagle!</q>
<lb/>Thus said he: <q>Beat its back; why should it fall
<lb/>Upon its better? Gibbet it on high
<lb/>To suffer in its turn, for e’en in fight
<lb/>The subject may not seek to conquer kings.</q>
<lb/>Another chief—one of the emissaries—
<lb/>Said thus: <q>O monarch of the world! Barzin
<lb/>At morn departed with the host and met
<lb/>A reader of the stars who prophesied:—
<lb/><q>None will behold again this haughty chief,
<lb/>This mighty army, and its equipage,
<lb/>When once their backs are turned upon the king!</q></q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Revolving heaven hath shown
<lb/>Barzin’s designs a loving countenance,
<lb/>And stars and sun and moon will not destroy
<lb/>That chieftain with his treasure and his host.</q>
<lb/>Another archmage said: <q>The king, one day,
<lb/>Bade choose a man, illustrious by birth,
<lb/>To make the circuit of the sovereignty
<lb/>Both for the sake of justice and to send
<milestone unit="calced" n="1760"/>
<lb/>Reports concerning matters great and small,
<lb/>And good or evil, to the court. Gashasp
<lb/>Is both illustrious and old: ’twere well
<lb/>That justice be administered by him.</q>
<lb/><pb n="8.18"/>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Gashasp, though far from want,
<lb/>Is still possessed by greed. Choose some one else,
<lb/>Who toileth not upon his own behalf,
<lb/>And is possessed of treasures of his own,
<lb/>One of experience, upright and austere,
<lb/>Whose first concern is for the poor.</q>
<lb/>One said:—
<lb/><q>The chief cook hath a grievance ’gainst the Shah
<lb/>And chiefs, and saith: <q>I dress his favourite meats,
<lb/>And serve them at cross roads. He savoureth not,
<lb/>Nor toucheth, them!</q> That loyal—servant quaketh.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>Too much food may disgust,</q> the Shah replied.
<lb/>Another said: <q>All thoughtful people blame
<lb/>The king of kings because he goeth forth
<lb/>Without an ample escort, and the hearts
<lb/>Of all his friends are full on that account
<lb/>For fear some enemy with ill designs
<lb/>May suppliant-wise contrive to get at him.</q>
</p>
<p>

    <lb/>He made this answer: <q>Equity and wisdom
<lb/>Protect the great king’s person. Right sufficeth
<lb/>To guard the just Judge though he be alone.</q>
</p>
<p><lb/>Another said: <q>O wisdom’s mate! the prince
<lb/>Of Khurasan said on the riding-ground:—

<lb/><q>I know not why the king recalled Garshasp.</q></q>
</p>
<p><lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>He hath left undone
<lb/>My bidding and ignored my purposes:

<lb/>I ordered him to ope for good or ill
<lb/>My treasury’s portal to deserving folk.

<lb/>The man that is a niggard in his gifts
<lb/>Concealeth all the monarch’s Grace divine.</q>

<lb/>Another said: <q>The great king is a magnate
<lb/>With all men, and munificent and holy.

<lb/>What hath Mihrak, that ancient servant, done
<lb/>To have his pay reduced, his visage wan?</q><pb n="8.19"/>
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Mihrak hath grown too bold,
<lb/>Relying on his former services.
<lb/>He came to court and took his seat bemused,
<lb/>And he was never save with wine in hand.</q>
</p>
<p><lb/>An archmage of the intelligencers said:—
<lb/><q>The Shah, when marching to encounter Caesar,
<lb/>Called only the Iranians to the war,
<lb/>And so Iran became hard pressed by Rum.</q>
</p>
<p><lb/>He answered: <q>This hostility is innate,
<lb/>'Tis war with Ahriman.</q>
<lb/>Another time
<lb/>One ventured to observe: <q>The Shah selecteth
<lb/>Troops differing from those of former Shahs.
<lb/>What look’st thou for in charger-riding Lions,
<lb/>Expert of hand, upon the day of battle?</q>

</p>
<p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1761"/>
<lb/>He thus replied: <q>The cavalier of war
<lb/>Ne’er must be satiate of combating.
<lb/>Feast and the field of battle must be one
<lb/>To him both by bright day and darksome night.
<lb/>He never faileth in the hour of need,
<lb/>And few or many make no odds to him.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Nushirwan, the Shah!
<lb/>Live ever joyful and with youthful fortune.
<lb/>A man was at the gateway from Nisa—
<lb/>A servant and a trusty officer—
<lb/>Who at the reckoning at the taxing-office
<lb/>Was found short by three hundred thousand drachms.
<lb/>He pleaded: <q>All are spent.</q>Chiefs, archimages,
<lb/>And tax-collectors are concerned.</q>
<lb/>The king,
<lb/>On hearing how the archimages claimed
<lb/>The money from the officer, commanded:—
<lb/><q>Press not for what is spent: give him too something
<lb/>Out of the treasury.</q><pb n="8.20"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/><q>A gallant cavalier was hurt and long
<lb/>Disabled. Cured he charged the ranks of Rum,
<lb/>Fell, and hath left behind him little ones.</q>
<lb/>The Shah commanded: <q>Be four thousand drachms
<lb/>Assigned to them out of the treasury,
<lb/>Because when any one is slain in war,
<lb/>And leaveth babes as his memorial,
<lb/>Whene’er the scribe shall read out from the roll
<lb/>His name, his children must have drachms, so pay
<lb/>A thousand thus to them four times a year.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>Be happy all thy days.
<lb/>At Marv the captain of the host hath gathered
<lb/>Much wealth in money but he spendeth not,
<lb/>And people are abandoning the march.</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>Give that wealth—the cause
<lb/>Whereby the land is made depopulate—
<lb/>Back to the folk from whom it hath been taken.
<lb/>Make proclamation of the fact in Marv,
<lb/>And bid erect a gibbet at his door,
<lb/>In sight of all his province and his troops,
<lb/>And hang alive the tyrant on the gallows,
<lb/>Head-downward, that hereafter nobody
<lb/>Among our paladins may turn aside
<lb/>In heart and spirit from our ordinance.
<lb/>Why must he bleed the poor to get him wealth,
<lb/>And joy his body to his soul’s destruction?</q>
<lb/>Another said: <q>God-fearing Shah! thy subjects
<lb/>Throng in thy court, extol thine equity,
<lb/>And praise the Maker for thee.</q>
<lb/>He replied:—
<lb/><q>Thank God that we inspire alarm in none.
<lb/>Be it ours to tender yet more carefully
<lb/>Both innocent and guilty.</q><pb n="8.21"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said another:—
<lb/><q>O Shah endowed with Grace and understanding!
<lb/>The world is full of joy, delight, and sweets,<milestone unit="calced" n="1762"/>

<lb/>And lord and liege are dizzied in their heads
<lb/>At night-fall with the din.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>In us,</q> he answered,
<lb/><q>May small and great rejoice throughout the world.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah of power supreme!
<lb/>Detractors speak with blame of thee and say:—
<lb/><q>He squandereth vast treasures but he never
<lb/>Hath felt the labour of amassing them.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus returned reply: <q>If I withhold
<lb/>The wealth laid up within my treasury
<lb/>From those deserving of it all my gain
<lb/>Will turn to loss at last.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said:—
<lb/><q>O thou exalted king! God grant that scath
<lb/>May never come upon that soul of thine!
<lb/>The Jews and Christians are thine enemies,
<lb/>Are double-faced, and worship Ahriman.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>A brave Shah is not great
<lb/>Save he be tolerant.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><note n="1">Reading with P.</note>Mardwi hath spent,

</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said thus: <q>Such withal is our command :
<lb/>'Tis well for thee to give to the deserving.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah that toilest not !
<lb/>Much largess hath made void thy treasury.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus returned reply: <q>The open hand
<lb/>Doth start a man afresh, both leaf and bough.
<lb/>The world-lord, when a worshipper of God,
<pb n="8.22"/>

<lb/>Hath at his disposition all the world,
<lb/>But we have seen it niggard to the mean,
<lb/>And greed and harshness tempt not me.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>O king!</q> <lb/>
<lb/>An archmage said, <q>shrewd Kurakhan hath wrung
<lb/>From famous Balkh three hundred thousand drachms,
<lb/>And handed them to us who laid them up
<lb/>Among thy treasures.</q>
<lb/><q>We,</q> he made reply,
<lb/><q>Require not drachms through others’ sufferings,
<lb/>So give them back to those from whom they came,
<lb/>With somewhat also from the treasury,
<lb/>Because the world-lord that adoreth God
<lb/>Hath no desire to vex his subjects’ hearts.
<lb/>Raze Kurakhan’s fine palace and enrich
<lb/>His roofs with clay. His palace shall be waste,
<lb/>His profit toil and, after toil, distress
<lb/>And malison. Take from our roll his name,
<lb/>And hold of no account his likes at court.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah of glorious race !
<lb/>Thy converse turneth greatly on Jamshid
<lb/>And on Kats.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus Nushirwan replied :—
<lb/><q>Oh! may our knowledge keep them ever young !
<lb/>I speak of them that mine own head and crown
<lb/>May be remembered after I am dead.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>Why hideth,</q> asked another man, <q>the Shah
<lb/>His secrets from the illustrious Bahman ?</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1763"/>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>He turneth him from wisdom,
<lb/>And eateth of the fruit of his own lusts.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O Shah that tendereth thy subjects ?
<lb/>Why hast thou recently become remiss ?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>I associate
<lb/>With sage and archimage, for when the voice
<lb/>Of Ahriman is at our ears our hearts
<pb n="8.23"/>


<lb/>Grow void of counsel and our brains of sense.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>An archmage asked the monarch of the earth
<lb/>To speak concerning kingship and the Faith,

<lb/>And said: <q>A man of wisdom will allow
<lb/>A faithless better than a kingless world.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>I have said the same,
<lb/>And holy men have heard my words. The world-lord
<lb/>Ne’er saw a faithless world though every one
<lb/>Hath his own Faith. One man adoreth idols,
<lb/>Another’s Faith is pure. One said: <q>A curse
<lb/>Is better than a blessing,</q> but mere words
<lb/>Will never wreck the world, so speak thy mind.
<lb/>But when the great king too is void of Faith
<lb/>No one will bring down blessings on the world.
<lb/>Faith and the sovereignty are like the body
<lb/>And soul; the twain support the world.</q><note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>O Shah
<lb/>Of joyous nature! thou hast oft observed,</q>
<lb/>One said, <q>before the chiefs : <q>What time the throne
<lb/>Is destitute of king then Faith and wisdom
<lb/>Are worthless.</q> Once thou saidest: <q>I am fortune,
<lb/>And fortune’s pretext both for good and ill,
<lb/>And when one uttereth praises in the world
<lb/>The crop in secret cometh back to me.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Yea, ’tis well. The great king’s head
<lb/>Is fortune’s crown. The world is as the body ;
<lb/>Kings are its head and crowned accordingly.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah, the people’s friend !
<lb/>Be thine the sovereignty and length of days!
<lb/>Five days have passed, O lustre of the soul !
<lb/>Since last the high priest came before thy presence.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>I am not concerned thereat,
<lb/>For he is occupied on mine affairs.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O Shah of sunlike Grace to whom
<pb n="8.24"/>

<lb/>Time will bring forth no peer! we see a suitor
<lb/>Attending court each morn, and that affairs
<lb/>Are wrong with him, but wot not of his grievance.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>In Hijaz<note>Reading with P. In A.D. 575 the Persians overthrew the
<lb/>Axumite power in Arabia and conquered Yaman. The Hijaz would come to some extent within their sphere of influence.</note> thieves plundered him
<lb/>Of countless goods. That he may not be troubled
<lb/>I have replaced them from the treasury,
<lb/>And keep him at the court on this account
<lb/>To see if he can recognise the thieves.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O Shah of glorious birth,
<lb/>The lord of bounty and the lord of justice !


<milestone unit="calced" n="1764"/>


<lb/>Down from the time of Gayomart till now
<lb/>No Shah like thee hath filled the royal throne.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: <q>I give thanksgiving unto God
<lb/>That matters are as He would have them be.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The sentences of Nushirwan are past,
<lb/>The world is old but ever young my care ;
<lb/>My genius hath not blossomed to this last
<lb/>Though keen it grew, such fire in eld was there !
<lb/>For many a year I told this history
<lb/>Though hidden ’twas from Saturn, moon, and sun,
<lb/>But since Mahmud’s name crowned my poetry
<lb/>Its commendation through the world hath run.
<lb/>The idolators of Hind he bringeth down
<lb/>With sword whose sheen, like silk of Wash,<note>son épée damasquinée comme une broderie. Mohl. Wash is the name of a city in Turkistan, famous for its silk.</note> is bright.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>Nushirwan’s Letter of Counsel to his Son Hurmuz</head>
<p><pb n="8.25"/>
<lb/>Now read the letter of Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And muse upon it in thine ardent soul.
<lb/>He said: <q>This letter grateful to the heart,
<lb/>Instructed, learned, well counselled, and abstruse,
<lb/>Is from the Shah exalted and sun-faced.
<lb/>Great is he, heaven inclineth to his wish,
<lb/>The world-lord he, just and beneficent,
<lb/>Without reproach, the lavisher of treasure,
<lb/>Increaser of Kubad’s renown and throne,
<lb/>Transmitter of the crown of state and justice,
<lb/>Possessed of Grace and stature, fame and conduct,
<lb/>And all that he could wish for from the crown
<lb/>Of greatness, to Hurmuz, our own pure son,
<lb/>Who heartily accepteth all our counsels,
<lb/>And is through God glad and victorious,
<lb/>For evermore a world-lord crowned and throned.
<lb/>This lucky month upon the day Khurdad,
<lb/>With fair stars and world-brightening presages,
<lb/>We set upon thy head the crown of gold,
<lb/>As we ourselves received it from our sire,
<lb/>And give thee too the blessings which Kubad,
<lb/>The glorious, bestowed upon our crown.
<lb/>Be vigilant and master of the world,
<lb/>Be wise and noble and without offence,
<lb/>Increase in knowledge and incline to God,
<lb/>Because He is the Guider of thy soul.
<lb/>We have inquired of one of good discourse,
<lb/>One ancient both in wisdom and in years:—
<lb/><q>What man of us approacheth nearest God?
<lb/>Who goeth by the straitest path to Him?</q>
<lb/>He gave reply: <q>Choose knowledge as thou wouldst
<lb/>That people should bless thee because the sage


<pb n="8.26"/>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1765"/>

<lb/>Deriveth not addition from the dust:
<lb/>Make thy pure spirit then approved by knowledge.</q>
<lb/>Through knowledge doth the Shah adorn the throne:
<lb/>Mayst thou be sage and of victorious fortune.
<lb/>God grant thou never be a promise-breaker,
<lb/>For promise-breakers have the dust for shroud.
<lb/>See that thou punish not the innocent,
<lb/>Or listen to the words of slanderers.
<lb/>Let every ordinance of thine be just,
<lb/>For justice will delight thy spirit. Seek not,
<lb/>As thou wouldst be the lustre of thy throne,
<lb/>To compass falsehood with thy tongue. Secure
<lb/>A subject in the enjoyment of his wealth,
<lb/>For others’ havings are no friends of thine:
<lb/>Joy in the wealth that thou hast earned thyself.
<lb/>Tis thine to be the asylum for all folk,
<lb/>For overlord and underling alike.
<lb/>Reward the man that acteth uprightly;
<lb/>Oppose withal the evil-doer. Although
<lb/>Thou mayst be held in honour in the world,
<lb/>Forget not travail, misery, and loss;
<lb/>Be what one may this is a Wayside Inn
<lb/>Wherein it booteth not to feel at home.
<lb/>Seek worth and be associate with the wise
<lb/>If dost wish that fortune shall commend thee.
<lb/>By knowledge bind the hands of tyranny,
<lb/>As thou wouldst scape the evil of mishap,
<lb/>And dearly tender him who in thy presence
<lb/>Hath trodden under foot thy foeman’s life.
<lb/>The great men and the merchants of the city
<lb/>Must have their share of justice. When thou settest
<lb/>The crown of king of kings upon thy head
<lb/>Discern the worse way from the truly great.
<lb/>Keep ever in thy presence some wise man,
<lb/>And hold him as thy body and thy soul.


<pb n="8.27"/>


<lb/>In matters great and small pay no regard
<lb/>To any save the accomplished and well born.
<lb/>Give not the worthless battle-gear for when
<lb/>Thou seekest it ’tis not to hand. Thy friend
<lb/>Will yield thee to the foe; a double task
<lb/>Both difficult and wretched will be thine:
<lb/>He will bring down thy weapons to the field,
<lb/>And one day will employ them on thyself.
<lb/>Be generous to persons in distress,
<lb/>Avoid ill-doing, fear calamity,
<lb/>Discern the hidden motives of thy heart,
<lb/>Make no mere outward show of good and right,
<lb/>Be not unmeasured in beneficence,
<lb/>And hear the counsels of the experienced.
<lb/>Lean toward religious men but watch religion,
<lb/>Because it causeth bitterness and wrath.
<lb/>Proportion thine expenses to thy means,
<lb/>And be not careful to augment thy store.
<lb/>Observe the precedents of former Shahs,
<lb/>And be a righteous judge in everything;


<milestone unit="calced" n="1766"/>


<lb/>The Shah that doth unjustly is accursed;
<lb/>Approve but justice then and court not curses.
<lb/>Where are the crowned heads of the kings of kings?
<lb/>Where are the great men and the ministers?
<lb/>Their fame is now their sole memorial;
<lb/>This Wayside Inn abideth not with any.
<lb/>Command not to shed blood, or urge the host
<lb/>To battle, lightly. Heed this weighty letter.
<lb/>Set not thy heart upon this Hostelry.
<lb/>Herein have I but sought thy good and decked
<lb/>Thy heart with knowledge by the rede of Him
<lb/>Who ruleth sun and moon; by Him keep off
<lb/>The influence of the Div. Have thou before thee
<lb/>This letter, day and night. Let wisdom rule
<lb/>Thy heart. If thou dost make a memory here
<lb/>Thy name will never want for majesty.


<pb n="8.28"/>


<lb/>Now be the Maker of the world thy refuge,
<lb/>May time and earth affect thee. May high heaven
<lb/>Turn but at thy desire and in the world
<lb/>Be none aggrieved by thee.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>He placed the letter,
<lb/>When written, in the treasury and abode
<lb/>With fear and trembling in this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>A king of kings well counselled, wise, and just,
<lb/>Will strive to make his modesty unite
<lb/>With strength of hand and gallantry in fight,
<lb/>Be of pure Faith and put in God his trust.
<lb/>See what man of these virtues is possest
<lb/>And, seeing, him his meed of praise prefer,
<lb/>Seek one that is as bright as Jupiter,
<lb/>Aspiring, armed with sword, with mail on breast;
<lb/>Who taketh from idolaters the sway,
<lb/>Who with brocade of Faith his heart hath bound.
<lb/>Yea verily the man himself is found:
<lb/>Mahmud is monarch of the world to-day.
<lb/>The quest of battle and of banqueting
<lb/>Are one to this world’s lord. Abwt’l Kasim!
<lb/>God grant the age joy in the sight of him,
<lb/>That open-handed and victorious king.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How an Archmage questioned Nushirwan and how he made Answer</head>
<p>
<lb/>There was an elder versed in our old speech,
<lb/>And antiquate with action and discourse,
<lb/>Who from a volume in the ancient tongue


<pb n="8.29"/>


<lb/>Saith that an archmage asked of Nushirwan:—
<lb/><q>In what way should the worshipper invoke
<lb/>In secret prayer the Master of the world
<lb/>That He may give an answer and bestow
<lb/>Withal fair fortune on his suppliant?
<lb/>A man, with arms outstretched toward the sky,
<lb/>May make request before the Lord of time,</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1767"/>

<p>
<lb/>Yet gain not his desire for all his prayers,
<lb/>And hath but tearful eyes and furrowed face.
<lb/>The conquering Shah replied: <q>Be moderate
<lb/>In thy requests to God; when they pass bounds
<lb/>A heart o’ercharged will come of that desire.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>What man deserveth good,
<lb/>And who is worthiest of the name of <q>Great?</q></q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>He that amasseth treasure
<lb/>Without exertion, and bestoweth not,
<lb/>Is unfit for the throne; from time to time
<lb/>His fortune will grow dark, but well is he
<lb/>That giveth. Give, if wealth be thine, and hoard not.</q>
<lb/><q>What is the base of wisdom?</q> asked the archmage,
<lb/><q>And who rejoiceth in its boughs and leaves?</q>
<lb/><q>The sage rejoiceth,</q> Nushirwan replied;
<lb/><q>So doth the modest man of noble birth.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Who profiteth by knowledge,
<lb/>And who is witless and calamitous?</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>The cherisher of wisdom
<lb/>Will cherish life which profiteth thereby
<lb/>When it aboundeth, but its lack entaileth
<lb/>Grief, care, and loss.</q>
<lb/>The archmage inquired:—
<lb/><q>Is knowledge better than the Grace of kings,
<lb/>For Grace and majesty adorn the throne?</q>
<lb/><q>A sage possessed of Grace,</q> replied the Shah,


<pb n="8.30"/>


<lb/>Will take the whole world underneath his wing.
<lb/>Thou needest wisdom, Grace, renown, and birth;
<lb/>With these four heaven will keep thee still in mind.
<lb/><q>In kingship who illustrateth the throne?</q>
<lb/>The archmage said. <q>Who is unfortunate?</q>
<lb/>And Nushirwan made answer: <q>One that seeketh
<lb/>First for the aidance of the King, the World-lord,</q><note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/><q>For bounty, knowledge, and right usages
<lb/>Will make him tender toward the suppliant.
<lb/>Next let him give authority to those,
<lb/>Who merit such distinction by their worth.
<lb/>Then let him see that nothing in the world
<lb/>For good or evil is concealed from him.
<lb/>He should distinguish, fourthly, foe from friend:
<lb/>Tis well that kings should be without offence.
<lb/>When he hath Grace and wisdom, Faith and fortune,
<lb/>Then he is worthy of the crown and graceth
<lb/>The throne, while if thou findest such things lacking
<lb/>Good sooth! thou wilt behold him lustreless;
<lb/>He after death will leave an evil name,
<lb/>And win not jocund Paradise at last.</q><note>Five couplets omitted.</note>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1768"/>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>How many modes of speech
<lb/>Are there and what are they, because o’er some
<lb/>One needs must weep while others are crown, treasure,
<lb/>And reputation, those grief, these content?</q>
<lb/>Said Nushirwan: <q>The sage hath classified
<lb/>The modes of speech and thought the matter out.
<lb/>First, profitable speech; the sweet-voiced sage
<lb/>Saith that it is the harmless. Secondly,
<lb/>That which thou callest the deliberate
<lb/>Know to be that of shrewd and fluent men,
<lb/>For they speak</q><note>Reading with P.</note><q>largely to the point and leave


<pb n="8.31"/>


<lb/>Their memory in the world. Next is the speech
<lb/>Of one ambitioning the word in season;
<lb/>He will abide in honour all his years;
<lb/>And, fourthly, that of one called by the sage
<lb/>Delectable—the competent reciter,
<lb/>Who uttereth all, both new and old, in verse;
<lb/>While, fifthly, is the warm deliverance
<lb/>Of one of sweet tongue and harmonious voice,
<lb/>Who when he hath impleached his web of words
<lb/>Attaineth verily his heart’s desire.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>In spite of all thy lore,
<lb/>And thou hast kindled all thy soul with knowledge,
<lb/>Yet thou still questionest the little worth!
<lb/>Dost say then: <q>How shall knowledge have an end?</q></q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>From all that I have learned
<lb/>I have attained my soul’s desire and wisdom.
<lb/>Avoid wrong-doing then and look to knowledge—
<lb/>A thing more precious than the crown and throne.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>I have seen none so praised
<lb/>And eminent for lore that one could say:—
<lb/><q>Such is his eminence that no wise man
<lb/>Can teach him any further.</q></q>
<lb/>Thus the Shah
<lb/>Replied: <q>Can treasure satiate a man
<lb/>Until he lieth underneath the dust?
<lb/>The way of knowledge is more glorious
<lb/>Than wealth, more precious in the sage’s eyes.
<lb/>Our words remain as our memorial:
<lb/>Compare not wealth with knowledge.</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.32"/>

<p>
<lb/>Said the archmage:—
<lb/><q>What with their learning and remembering
<lb/>The sages cannot be but ancient men.</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Although the man be old
<lb/>His knowledge faileth not to keep him young.
<lb/>Thou wilt prefer him to the foolish youth,
<lb/>Whose dust is only valued for its tomb.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>It was thy wont to speak
<lb/>About the fortune of the kings of kings
<lb/>Before the Great,</q><note>Reading with P and T.</note><q>and more than ever now
<lb/>Thou namest them but with a deep cold sigh?</q>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>It was never in my heart
<lb/>That I should praise a process such as this—
<lb/>To govern this world with the scimitar
<lb/>Of justice, then pass on and vilely die.</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1769"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Thy usage,</q> said the archmage, <q>in the past
<lb/>Was this—to speak to all in nobler words.
<lb/>Now, thou despisest them and sayest naught
<lb/>About the past or present.</q>
<lb/>Nushirwan
<lb/>Made answer saying: <q>I have talked enough,
<lb/>And now I purpose to depend on deeds.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Thy prayers in former times
<lb/>Before the Fire were not so long as now.
<lb/>Thy praises too are longer than they were,
<lb/>Thy plaints and supplications more profuse.</q>
<lb/>He gave this answer saying: <q>Holy God
<lb/>Exalteth from the dust His worshipper,
<lb/>Doth favourably dispose the sky toward him,
<lb/>And maketh all the world to be his slave.
<lb/>If this slave faileth to appreciate,
<lb/>Let him not scape from hardship and distress.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Since thou becamest king
<lb/>What greater cause for thankfulness hast thou
<lb/>Toward thy Maker? Hath that eminence
<lb/>Increased thy joy and filled thy foemen’s hearts
<lb/>With blood?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>Thanks be to God,
<lb/>Our fortune hath been good. None in my presence
<lb/>Hath ever sought for the supremacy,


<pb n="8.33"/>


<lb/>But at my chastening washed his hands of ill.
<lb/>My foemen have grown feeble in the fight
<lb/>When they beheld mine onset and my mace.</q>
<lb/>The priest went on: <q>When warring in the West
<lb/>Thou wast both quick of clutch and valorous,
<lb/>But when thou wast campaigning in the East
<lb/>Thou wast long-suffering and deliberate.</q>
<lb/>And Nushirwan made answer thus: <q>The youth
<lb/>Accounteth not of pain and toil of mind,
<lb/>But when a man hath come to sixty years
<lb/>He must assume a gentler attitude.
<lb/>Thanks to the World-lord who is all-providing,
<lb/>The Author of the good and ill of fortune,
<lb/>That I had prowess in my youthful days,
<lb/>And recked not if my luck were good or bad.
<lb/>Now knowledge, treasure, generosity,
<lb/>And rede, accompany my days of age,
<lb/>The world is ’neath my rule and usages,
<lb/>And circling heaven my breastplate in the fight.</q>
<lb/>Said the archmage: <q>The Shahs of long ago
<lb/>Desired to hold discourse on all affairs;
<lb/>Thy words are briefer and thy secrets more,
<lb/>Yet thou surpassest those famed men of old.</q>
<lb/>He made this answer, saying: <q>Every king,
<lb/>That doth believe in Him who giveth all,
<lb/>Is not concerned about himself for He,
<lb/>Who made the world, still watcheth over it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>I see the kings who should be glad of heart,</q>
The archmage said, <q>most anxious in our times.</q></p>

<p>And Nushirwan replied: <q>The man of sense
Hath ever at his heart the fear of loss.</q></p>

<p>The archimage rejoined: <q>The Shahs of old
Allowed not care and fight to mar their feasts.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1770"/>
He made this answer saying: <q>In their cups
They ever grew forgetful of their fame,
But fame hath triumphed o’er the cup with me,


<pb n="8.34"/>
My spirit is beforehand with the time.</q></p>
<p>

<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Shahs used to tend themselves,
<lb/>Employing drug and leech and remedy,
<lb/>Lest they should have to soil themselves with tears.</q>
<lb/><q>A man, whose time is not yet come,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Not yet o’ertaken by the turning sky,
<lb/>Will stand secure, and drugs will profit naught,
<lb/>Because the chance of time protecteth him,
<lb/>But when the hour for passing is at hand
<lb/>Then no precaution will avert his fate.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Thou praisest much and prayest
<lb/>The Maker, yet at heart thou art not glad
<lb/>The while, but ever hast a soul all care.</q>
<lb/><q>There is no care at all,</q> said Nushirwan,
<lb/><q>The Shah’s heart is at one with turning heaven;
<lb/>I fear that those who offer praise to me,
<lb/>And shower benedictions on my Faith,
<lb/>Affect a greater fervour than they feel:
<lb/>Mine object is to read my subjects’ hearts.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/><q>Why joy we in our children,</q> asked the archmage,
<lb/><q>And why do we desire a family?</q>
<lb/><q>The man that leaveth children in the world
<lb/>Will not become forgotten,</q> he replied.
<lb/><q>If he have children he will relish life,
<lb/>And for that reason will abstain from vice,
<lb/>While if he pass away the pang is slight,
<lb/>Because a child’s eyes watch his paling face.</q>
<lb/><q>Who liveth at his ease,</q> the archmage asked,
<lb/><q>And who repenteth of his own good deeds?</q>
<lb/>He thus replied: <q>The worshipper of God
<lb/>Will take the reins of fortune in his hands
<lb/>And, seeking no addition, is at ease,
<lb/>Who if he sought it would be full of fear.


<pb n="8.35"/>


<lb/>Then as for what thou said’st about good deeds,
<lb/>And secret inclinations to do good,
<lb/>Know, no one is more mortified than he
<lb/>That meditateth good for thankless folk.</q>
<lb/><q>The evil-doer dieth,</q> said the archmage,
<lb/><q>The world removeth from the roll his name.
<lb/>The righteous man will likewise pass away,
<lb/>And destiny account his every breath.
<lb/>What need is there for praising excellence
<lb/>Since death is here to reap both good and bad?</q>
<lb/>And Nushirwan made answer thus: <q>Good deeds
<lb/>Will find a ready market everywhere.
<lb/>He that doth good deeds dieth not though dead,
<lb/>But resteth, giving up his soul to God;</q><note>Couplet omitted.</note>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1771"/>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage further said: <q>No ill is worse
<lb/>Than death. If so, then what is our resource?</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>On leaving this dark earth,
<lb/>The life which then thou wilt have gained is pure.
<lb/>Whoe’er lived here in fear and care must needs
<lb/>Bewail that life but, whether Shah or subject,
<lb/>Thou wilt be quit of this world’s fear and pain.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked him: <q>Which is worst of these
<lb/>In filling us with anguish and chagrin?</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>Reckon mountain-heavy
<lb/>The troubles that descend on us in troops,
<lb/>And what is fear except the fear of troubles,
<lb/>Than which there is naught stronger in the world?</q>
<lb/><q>How can we ’scape from these?</q> the archmage asked,
<lb/><q>For this world’s doings give us cause to weep?</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>Knowledge is the way:
<lb/>The sage is ever cheerful.</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.36"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Which of us,</q>
<lb/>Inquired the archmage, <q>hath most store of treasure?</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>He that hath least toil.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Which is the foulest fault,
<lb/>One alien most from worth and Paradise?</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>In the case of women
<lb/>A strident voice and lack of modesty;
<lb/>But, in the case of men, to be a fool,
<lb/>And thus to spend a lifetime as in prison.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Who hath most confidence?</q>
<lb/><q>He that hath least remorse,</q> replied the Shah,
<lb/><q>And goeth soiled in body, and with heart
<lb/>Black with iniquity, before his God.</q>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Who is the upright man,
<lb/>Whose heart is proven by his soul and wisdom?</q>
<lb/>The Shah thus answered: <q>He that toileth on
<lb/>Through gain and loss and compasseth no ill.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Who is the best of men,
<lb/>The crown upon the head of all mankind?</q>
<lb/><q>The meek to whom a crown availeth naught,</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied; <q>not one intent on profit,
<lb/>Not even though he be of lofty aims;
<lb/>Next, he whose greatness is its own reward—
<lb/>The generous man whose heart is purged from darkness—
<lb/>And, thirdly, he that hath a zeal divine,
<lb/>Proceeding from integrity and wisdom.</q>
<lb/><q>What,</q> said the archmage, <q>is the heart’s chief dread?</q>
<lb/><q>The troubles that we bring upon ourselves,</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied.
<lb/><q>What giving is the best,</q>
<lb/>The archmage said, <q>so that the man who giveth


<pb n="8.37"/>


<lb/>May be exalted and great?</q>
<lb/><q>In gain and loss,</q>
<lb/>The Shah rejoined, <q>keep naught from the deserving.</q>
<lb/>The archmage asked concerning this world’s doings:—
<lb/><q>Declare its process open and concealed.
<lb/>Whate’er the manner of that action be,
<lb/>For loss or profit, shall we acquiesce?</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1772"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>The All-knowing,</q> thus the Shah replied, <q>is greater
<lb/>And higher than this ancient sky although
<lb/>It knowing be and mindful; He is Lord
<lb/>Of this world’s lords. Become not then perverse,
<lb/>Avoid disaster, and attribute not
<lb/>Good fortune and misfortune to the sky.
<lb/>Know that both ill and good proceed from Him
<lb/>That hath no peer—the One eternal Cause,
<lb/>Whose word is <q>Be</q>and what He willeth is,
<lb/>Who was and is and will be evermore.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>The body is the hostel of the soul:
<lb/>Which of them feeleth pain?</q> the archmage asked.
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Our mortal bodies suffer
<lb/>So long as they have brains, but when the soul
<lb/>Hath filtered through they lose their consciousness,
<lb/>And when it hath departed are dissolved.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archmage questioned him on self-control:—
<lb/><q>In what way can we hide our greed and need?</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>’Tis fitting that the sage
<lb/>Suppress them, yet thou ever wilt be vexed
<lb/>By greed because ne’er satiate of treasure.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Among the kings of yore,
<lb/>The men of sense, rede, faith, and precedent,
<lb/>Whom knowest thou as subject of our praise,
<lb/>When he is dead, O monarch of the earth?</q>
<lb/><q>That great king,</q> this was Nushirwan’s reply,


<pb n="8.38"/>


<lb/><q>Who is a worshipper of God and pure,
<lb/>And thankful to the righteous Lord of all,
<lb/>Who filleth none with fear of tyranny,
<lb/>Who giveth to the good a hopeful heart,
<lb/>And to the bad a heart of fear and pain,
<lb/>Who furnisheth his troops from his own treasures,
<lb/>And turneth on malignants their own ill,
<lb/>Who questioneth the sages of the world,
<lb/>And keepeth from his foes his bad and good.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The archmage asked: <q>Wherein consisteth worship,
<lb/>And who approacheth to God’s holiness?</q>
<lb/><q>The subtle will direct,</q> the Shah replied,
<lb/><q>His soul as by fine hair-breadths and first know
<lb/>The being and the unity of God,
<lb/>Which small instruction will make evident,
<lb/>And he will offer thanks for mercies given,
<lb/>While putting trust in God and fearing Him,
<lb/>Who is thy terror when thou seekest ill,
<lb/>Thy trust when thou dost well. If thou art sound
<lb/>Of Faith and seek’st the Way all will esteem thee,
<lb/>While if thou art malign and ill-disposed
<lb/>Thy soul hath forwarded its packs to Hell.
<lb/>Feel not at home with this world for 'twil hold
<lb/>Its secrets from thee. Tend to works of Faith;
<lb/>Thy good choice will not injure thee. Let wisdom
<lb/>Instruct thy heart and let not fortune fool thee.
<lb/>Again, thou shalt consort not with the guilty</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1773"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>In wrong and strife. Loathe secretly at heart
<lb/>This world because of that which is to come.
<lb/>Let thy seat ever be among the sages,
<lb/>A devotee of everlasting joys,
<lb/>For what we have on earth will pass away,
<lb/>And reason counteth them no joys at all.
<lb/>Mayst thou incline to sense and rede. Let wisdom
<lb/>Guide thee to God. Speak not unmeasured words,
<lb/>For thou’rt new-fangled and the world is old.
</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.39"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Be drunk not with the pleasures of the day.
<lb/>Choose not the company of wicked men.
<lb/>Refrain thy heart from what can never be,
<lb/>And give such largess as 'tis fit to give.
<lb/>Withhold not from a friend aught that thou hast,
<lb/>Though he should ask thine eyes, thy brains, and skin,
<lb/>And if two friends would take account together
<lb/>No daysman should be needed for that task.
<lb/>If thou associate with a foe so act
<lb/>That he may not obtain a hold upon thee.
<lb/>When one doth seek the path of right his need
<lb/>Is parts, humility, and gentleness.
<lb/>Let not thy tongue exaggerate thy merits,
<lb/>For falsehood is no merit with the just,
<lb/>Who hold one’s high estate a thing of naught,
<lb/>Another’s poverty no mark for scorn.
<lb/>If some malicious person talk with thee
<lb/>Let not his malice anger thee, and then,
<lb/>When, being well assured that thou art weak,
<lb/>He useth language that is past all bounds,
<lb/>Reply to him in measured terms and speak
<lb/>Words goodly and well-liking. If it be
<lb/>That thou canst bring him to himself by kindness
<lb/>He will repent his former speech. Devote not
<lb/>Thy leisure to indulgence. Idleness
<lb/>Is naught if thou art wise. Be diligent
<lb/>In all thine undertakings and give ear
<lb/>To knowledge. Enter on no enterprise
<lb/>Whereof the end will cause remorse or anger.
<lb/>Have pity on the sad in his distress;
<lb/>Bring not his heart to anguish and disaster.
<lb/>The sage that traineth his own heart to patience
<lb/>Is not held worthless in the World-lord’s eyes,
<lb/>But knoweth what he meriteth with Him,
<lb/>And compasseth all actions with discretion,
</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.40"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>For increase from a friend is laudable,
<lb/>And greatness and integrity will bring
<lb/>Addition. Furthermore that man of God
<lb/>Will not begrudge the scattering of treasure,
<lb/>But turneth him from waywardness and loss,
<lb/>And maketh right and service his profession—
<lb/>A stem with boughs whereby God’s worshipper,
<lb/>The virtuous saint, hath proved victorious.
<lb/>There is but one injunction and one way—
<lb/>Incline to God and let Him shelter thee.</q>

<div><head>PART VI: THE SHAH’S LAST YEARS</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="argument"><head>Argument</head>

<p><pb n="8.41"/>The poet tells of the last war of Nushirwan against Rum and of the Shah’s transaction with a shoemaker, the appointment of his son Hurmuzd as his successor after that prince had been questioned by Buzurjmihr, the Shah’s testament and last counsels to his son, his dream of the advent of Muhammad, and the death of the Shah and of Buzurjmihr.</p>
</div>
<div><head>NOTE</head>

<p>§§ 1-3. After ten years of peace war again broke out between the Persian and Roman empires in A.D. 572. The
Shahnama is correct in representing that the latter was to blame for the renewal of hostilities. The Emperor Justin
II., who had succeeded his uncle Justinian in A.D. 565, wanted war. The scene of operations covered much the same ground as on the previous occasion. The Persians made a raid into
Syria, recorded in the Shahnama by the mention of Halab
(Chalybon-Beroea, Aleppo), and an unsuccessful attack on
Antioch. The Romans, under Marcian (Batarun), the prefect of the East, besieged Nisibis, held by the Persians ever since its cession to Shapur, son of Hurmuz (Sapor II.), by Jovian in A.D. 363. Nushirwan raised the siege, drove the Romans into the stronghold of Dara on the foot-hills of Mount Masius, and besieged them there. After a gallant defence the fortress fell late in A.D. 573.<note n="1">For Dara see GDF. v. 86 and note.</note> Mount Masius seems to be the Mount
Talikan of the Shahnama, the scene of one of Gushtasp’s exploits during his exile in Rum.<note n="2">See Vol. iv. p. 342 seq.</note> Justin on this resigned the direction

<pb n="8.42"/> of affairs to Tiberius who to gain time purchased a temporary suspension of hostilities from the Persians. This is represented in the Shahnama as the conclusion of peace and as a triumph for Nushirwan but historically the war was still in progress at the time of his death four years later, and the
Great King, shortly before the end of his reign, had to make a somewhat hasty and ignominious retirement to Ctesiphon.<note n="3">RSM, p. 437.</note></p>

<p>§ 2. We have already met with the cobbler or shoemaker, introduced as characteristic of a type, in the Shahnama.<note n="4">See Vol. vii. pp. 24, 260.</note></p>

<p>§§ 4-6. See p. 3.</p>

<p>§7. P. omits this section which of course comes from
Muhammadan sources. Though interpolated into Persian story it does not seem to be an interpolation in Firdausi’s
Shahnama for there appears to be no good reason for supposing that the passage was written by a hand other than that poet’s. A similar account appears both in the Persian and
Arabic Tabari.<note n="5">ZT, li. 235, NT, p. 253.</note>
</p><p>

The ascent of two score degrees is intended to indicate that
Muhammad was forty years old when he received his <q>call.</q>
</p><p>

Muhammad, having been challenged by idolaters to divide the moon in twain, is said to have pointed his finger at it, on which it was at once divided into two parts, one of which remained stationary while the other was concealed behind
a mountain. Another tradition says that Mount Hira intervened between the two halves. Travellers from a distance when questioned reported that they had observed the same phenomenon.<note n="6">KM, Pt. II. Vol. ii. p. 753.</note> The passage in the Quran on which the traditions are based runs as follows:—<q>The hour hath approached and the MOON hath been cleft:


But whenever they see a miracle they turn aside and say,


<q>This is well-devised magic.</q></q><note n="7">RK, p. 74.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><head>How Nushirwan made ready to war against Caesar
</head>
<p><pb n="8.43"/>
    <lb/>It is recorded in the ancient book
<lb/>From the recital of a truthful sage
<lb/>That when news came from Rum to this fair land
<lb/>For Nushirwan, the world-lord: <q>Mayst thou live,
<lb/>For Caesar is no more and to another
<lb/>Hath yielded time and earth,</q> death filled his soul
<lb/>With care; his ruddy countenance became
<lb/>Like yellow leaves. He chose out of Iran
<lb/>An envoy of experience and high birth,
<lb/>And then dispatched him unto Caesar’s son,
<lb/>Dispatched him to that fresh and fruitful Bough,
<lb/>First charging him with many kindly words,
<lb/>And saying: <q>’Tis an evil none can ’scape.</q>
<lb/>He wrote a letter in distress and grief,
<lb/>With eyes all tearful and cheeks sallow, thus:—
<lb/><q>God grant thee life and loving-kindliness
<lb/>Now that thy sire is dead. No living thing
<lb/>Is born unless to die. A Wayside Inn
<lb/>Is this and we pass on. Although we handle
<lb/>The crown or helm and casque we find no quittance
<lb/>From death’s clutch. What is Caesar or the Khan
<lb/>When his time cometh and all suddenly
<lb/>Shall lay his head in dust? Mayst thou receive
<lb/>No lack of joyful tidings of thy sire;
<lb/>May Christ befriend his soul. Now I have heard
<lb/>That thou art seated on his famous throne,
<lb/>And hast adorned the fortune that was his.
<lb/>Require of us such strength as thou dost need
<lb/>Of steeds, of arms, of treasure, and of troops.</q>
<lb/>The ambassador went forth from Nushirwan;
<lb/>He made the journey in all haste to Caesar,


<pb n="8.44"/>


<lb/>And, when he reached the court, they gave him entry;
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah approached the state.
<lb/>When Caesar saw the title on the scroll
<lb/>His heart swelled at the pride of Nushirwan.
<lb/>He was a hasty youth, new to the throne,
<lb/>Showed himself overbearing to the envoy,
<lb/>Saluted him in an unseemly fashion,
<lb/>With lax observance and discourtesy,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1775"/>
<lb/>Gave him a lodging distant from the court,
<lb/>And took no notice of the Great King’s letter.
<lb/>A week passed, Caesar’s counsellors assembled,
<lb/>And he addressed their leader: <q>Now consider
<lb/>The answer to this letter, draw it up,
<lb/>As thou dost know to do, in fitting terms,
<lb/>And set forth good and ill.</q>
<lb/>The priest replied:—
<lb/><q>Thy liege am I and will obey the world-lord.</q>
<lb/>So all the bishops, priests, and counsellors
<lb/>Assembled by themselves apart and then
<lb/>Wrote with all speed a letter in response,
<lb/>As Caesar bade, and first they praised the Maker,
<lb/>And based their praise on wisdom, then they said:—
<lb/><q>Was such a letter worthy of the Shah,
<lb/>A letter graceless and malevolent?
<lb/>Thou dost amiss for Caesar is but young,
<lb/>But lately crowned, our king in right of birth.
<lb/>Forbear to press the youth for this one year
<lb/>With haughty superscriptions, tax and toll.
<lb/>The youth hath written in befitting terms
<lb/>To all the lieges and the potentates,
<lb/>As the illustrious emperor of Rum,
<lb/>To whom the mountain-tops are so much wax.
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah hath come to us,
<lb/>And he will tell the Shah what he hath seen
<lb/>With us—our words of grief and joy alike:


<pb n="8.45"/>


<lb/>Our weal and woe shall not remain concealed.
<lb/>One Caesar hath departed but another
<lb/>Succeeded who exalteth o’er all chiefs
<lb/>His head without regard to any king
<lb/>Among the underlords and overlords.</q>
<lb/>When they were ready with that Roman letter
<lb/>They summoned the ambassador to court.
<lb/>That sage, on hearing that they were advised,
<lb/>Came to the court and asked for the response.
<lb/>They made him ready an unworthy robe
<lb/>Of honour and put strangers from the hall.
<lb/>Then Caesar said to him: <q>No slave am I,
<lb/>The inferior of the Haitalians and Chin.
<lb/>One should not lightly treat a potentate
<lb/>Although thy Shah be Great King in the world.
<lb/>He that hath many enemies is great,
<lb/>And I have foes and friends upon my skirts.
<lb/>Why dost thou scant me of my majesty,
<lb/>And cloud my sun? Thou, when such need is mine,
<lb/>Shalt be my king, my father’s memory.
<lb/>Make fair report of thine experience here,
<lb/>And seek no foul intent in my response.</q>
<lb/>They put the robe of honour on the sage,
<lb/>And called the marchlord’s roadster to the door.
<lb/>He parted hastily and, tarrying not
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1776"/>
<lb/>At any stage, reached Nushirwan and told
<lb/>What he had seen and heard and what had passed.
<lb/>The Shah was sorry at the words and said:—
<lb/><q>Thou hast had fruit of travel. I have heard
<lb/>That whosoever indulgeth his self-will,
<lb/>Not thinking what he doth, will smart therefor.

<lb/>If he discerneth not 'twixt friend and foe
<lb/>In telling thus the secret of his heart
<lb/>To thee I ween too that he is no friend
<lb/>To us and, further, hath not blood and feet
<lb/>And skin. By holy God, by sun and moon,


<pb n="8.46"/>


<lb/>By crown and throne and by Azargashasp,
<lb/>I swear that if I leave of Ruman race
<lb/>A single man in joy upon the throne
<lb/>I am not of the race of bold Kubad,
<lb/>And in men’s presence never mention me.
<lb/>Henceforth will I make black the fame of Rum,
<lb/>And set the cultivated parts a-blaze.
<lb/>Moreover, he shall fill the ox-skins for us
<lb/>With all the gems and treasures of his realm,
<lb/>And my sword’s point shall touch not sheath until
<lb/>I have my heart’s desire upon this Ruman,
<lb/>Who arrogantly boasteth: <q>I am Caesar,</q>
<lb/>As though I were but one among his chiefs!</q>
<lb/>He bade the clarions and the Indian bells
<lb/>And gongs be sounded at the palace-gate,
<lb/>And bound upon his mighty elephants
<lb/>The kettledrums. The world was indigo
<lb/>With dust. A host that made the green sea <note n="1">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 174 and note.</note> quail
<lb/>Marched forth from Mada’in toward the waste,
<lb/>While at the blare of trump, the gleam <note n="2">Reading with P.</note> of flag,

    <p>
<lb/>When tidings came to Caesar of the Shah:—
<lb/><q>He hath marched forth in anger from Iran,</q>
<lb/>He set forth from 'Ammuriya<note n="1">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 23 and note.</note> to Halab;


<pb n="8.47"/>


<lb/>The world was filled with tumult, bruit, and din.
<lb/>Three hundred thousand horsemen of Iran
<lb/>Besieged the fortress of Halab. Troops gathered
<lb/>From every side and tarried not from strife.
<lb/>The warrior-prelates of the Roman host
<lb/>Set up their catapults on every side.<note n="2">Cf. Vol. i. p. 373.</note>
<lb/>The Iranians took the stronghold of Sakila,
<lb/>For from that region they would fain attack;
<lb/>Halab became as 'twere a sea of blood,
<lb/>And all the host of Batarun sought quarter;
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1777"/>
<lb/>Unnumbered Romans perished 'neath the arrows,
<lb/>And many were ta'en prisoners in the fight.
<lb/>Within two se'nnights the Iranians brought
<lb/>Some thirty thousand captives to the king.
<lb/>The Romans dug a trench before their host,
<lb/>And let the water in at break of day.
<lb/>They barred the Shah's advance; he and his troops
<lb/>Were at a stand in fight. He called to him
<lb/>His commissaries and discussed with them
<lb/>The posture of the war at large and said
<lb/>Thus: <q>This hath grown a matter of much toil:
<lb/>We cannot pass the water and the fosse.
<lb/>The troops have need of money and supplies,
<lb/>As well as horses, mail, and Roman helms.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The commissaries, scribes, and treasurers
<lb/>Of that world-lord went the treasury,
<lb/>Which, as the number of his soldiers stood,
<lb/>Was in dinars three hundred thousand short.<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>An archmage came to the Shah like dust,
<lb/>And told him what the treasury lacked, whereat
<lb/>The Shah's face gloomed. He ordered Buzurjmihr
<lb/>To come, and said to him: <q>With treasury void
<lb/>What booteth me the throne of king of kings?
<lb/>Go, call the camel-drivers, and dispatch
<lb/>Some Bactrian camels on the road and take


<pb n="8.48"/>


<lb/>Out of the treasures of Mazandaran
<lb/>A hundred loads and upwards of dinars.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>But Buzurjmihr made answer to the world-lord:—
<lb/><q>O just, wise, loving Shah! the way is long
<lb/>To reach the treasures of Iran, the while
<lb/>Our troops are destitute and at a stand;
<lb/>But in the cities round about are those,
<lb/>A hundredth of whose wealth would pay our troops.
<lb/>If thou shalt ask the merchants and the thanes
<lb/>To make advances they will not refuse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah was in this matter of a mind
<lb/>With what the wise man of Iran had said,
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr chose out a messenger,
<lb/>Wise, of a cheerful heart, and goodly face,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Go with a second horse,
<lb/>And choose thee out some lusty notable
<lb/>Among the merchants and the thanes—a man
<lb/>Of mighty reputation—and request
<lb/>A loan of money for the troops. The Shah
<lb/>Will order money to be sent with speed
<lb/>Out of the treasury.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That emissary,
<lb/>Fair-spoken, young in years but old in wisdom
<lb/>And shrewd, came to a neighbouring town and asked
<lb/>A loan of money for the king's affairs,
<lb/>And round him gathered many of the rich.
<lb/>A certain man, who made and vended shoes,
<lb/>Attended closely to the envoy's words,
<lb/>And asked: <q>How much?</q>
<lb/>The gallant envoy told,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1778"/>
<lb/>And said: <q>O man of wisdom and of wealth!
<lb/>The sum amounteth to four million drachms.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said that shoemaker: <q>I will furnish them,
<lb/>And earn the treasurer’s praise.</q>
</p>




<p>He brought his balance,
<pb n="8.49"/>

<lb/>Weights, and the drachms, but asked no bond in writing.
<lb/>He weighed the coin, the envoy’s task was done.
<lb/>Then that shoemaker said: <q>O fair of face!
<lb/>Be good enough to say to Buzurjmihr :-—
<lb/><q>I have but one child only in this world,
<lb/>For whom my heart is all anxiety.</q>
<lb/>Then add: <q>The monarch of the world perchance
<lb/>Will grant a private favour to myself,
<lb/>And let me place my boy among his sages,
<lb/>For he hath wealth and intellect therefor.</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/><q>With pleasure,</q> was the messenger’s reply,
<lb/><q>For thou hast cut my quest for treasure short.</q><note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>So Buzurjmihr came to the Shah rejoicing,
<lb/>Whose face cleared when he saw that wealth.
<lb/>Thereafter
<lb/>He said: <q>Thanks be to God, whom I have known
<lb/>Through all my years of life, that in our realm
<lb/>There is a manufacturer of shoes,
<lb/>Blessed in this manner and illustrious.
<lb/>God grant that we may never injure one
<lb/>That is possessed of such a store of wealth.
<lb/>Discover for me what his wishes are,
<lb/>That this good will of his to us may last,
<lb/>And when thou payest the debt bestow upon him
<lb/>A hundred thousand drachms that he may not
<lb/>Forget us.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Buzurjmihr said to the world-lord :—
<lb/><q>O well-starred Shah of goodly countenance !
<lb/>God grant that no king who is tyrannous
<lb/>Be happy on his throne and fortunate.
<lb/>Thy subjects all are men of wealth, aspire,
<lb/>And are possessed of thrones and diadems.
<lb/>Now this boot-seller, if the Shah will hear,
<lb/>Made one request. He said, for so the envoy

<pb n="8.50"/>


<lb/>Reporteth : <q>May the world-lord mate with wisdom.
<lb/>I have a son grown up who is desirous
<lb/>Of one to teach him learning, and if now
<lb/>The Shah is willing to assist therein,
<lb/>So that my good son may become a scribe,
<lb/>Then for the Shah’s life will I pray God, saying :—
<lb/><q>May this throne-worthy live eternally.</q></q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah made answer saying: <q>O wise man !
<lb/>How hath the Div perplexed thy vision! Go,
<lb/>And lead the camels back, for God forbid
<lb/>That we ask him for silver and for pearls.
<lb/>How should the merchant’s son become a scribe,
<lb/>Accomplished, learned, and mindful though he be?
<lb/>Our son when he shall sit upon the throne
<lb/>Will need a scribe whose fortune will prevail.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1779"/>
<lb/>If this young boot-seller attain distinction,
<lb/>And my son look to him and list to him,
<lb/>The man of wisdom and of noble birth
<lb/>Will have but discontent and chilling sighs,
<lb/>The sage will be held lightly by my son,
<lb/>Receive no praise for what he answereth,
<lb/>And we shall be accursed, when we are dead,
<lb/>For having introduced this precedent.
<lb/>Our rations must be got by honest means.
<lb/>Ask not his money, talk not of our needs,
<lb/>Dispatch the camels back upon their way,
<lb/>And ask shoemakers for supplies no more.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>So with the cash the envoy went again ;
<lb/>Those drachms filled that shoemaker’s heart with
pain.<note n="1">Two couplets omitted.</note></p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How the Envoys of Caesar came to Nushirwan with Apologies and Presents</head>

<p><pb n="8.51"/>
<lb/>Whenas from Pisces Sol displayed its crown,
<lb/>And flung a robe of ivory o’er the earth,
<lb/>The scouts returning from the trench-edge came
<lb/>Before the exalted Shah and said to him:—
<lb/><q>An embassage from Caesar hath arrived
<lb/>In tribulation to excuse his faults.</q>
<lb/>The ambassador approached immediately
<lb/>With benedictions upon Nushirwan,
<lb/>On seeing whose head and crown the Roman heaved
<lb/>A cold sigh, thinking: <q>Lo! a Shah exalted
<lb/>With kingship, manhood, and a mighty host!</q>
<lb/>Two score philosophers of Rum, whose tongues
<lb/>Were full of utterance and their hearts of sighs,
<lb/>Brought, each one, thirty thousand in dinars
<lb/>As offerings to the king. When they beheld
<lb/>His comely countenance they came lamenting,
<lb/>And writhing serpent-like. The king of kings,
<lb/>On seeing them, received them graciously,
<lb/>Assigning them the customary seats,
<lb/>And then their spokesman thus addressed him:
<lb/><q>Caesar,
<lb/>O Shah! is young and hath but just acceded;
<lb/>His sire is dead, the world is new to him,
<lb/>And he is unacquainted with affairs.
<lb/>Now we are all of us thy tributaries,
<lb/>And servants, and are under thy protection.
<lb/>For thee Rum is Iran, Iran is Rum;
<lb/>Why then distinguish them? The king of kings
<lb/>Hath all the age’s wisdom for his own,


<pb n="8.52"/>


<lb/>And straighteneth Caesar’s back. The Khan of Chin,
<lb/>The king of Hind, are glad in him and help
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1780"/>
<lb/>To grace his throne. Although a youth, not yet
<lb/>Of man’s estate, made utterance ill-advised
<lb/>Let not the king of kings, in whom the vault
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli rejoiceth, take
<lb/>Revenge thereat or dudgeon. We will pay
<lb/>The tribute laid on Rum from the beginning,
<lb/>And keep pact.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Smiling at the envoy’s words
<lb/>Said Nushirwan: <q>Although the boy be noble
<lb/>His speech hath little wisdom. What is Caesar?
<lb/>What Batarun, the insensate one, whose tongue
<lb/>Hath caused his soul’s abasement? All the wise
<lb/>Born of Sikandar’s stock have proved triumphant,
<lb/>And eminent, yet if one doeth not
<lb/>Our bidding but rejecteth our advice
<lb/>And our alliance, from his peopled realm
<lb/>Will we send up the dust and will not fear
<lb/>His treasures and his troops.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The envoys kissed
<lb/>The ground, as courtiers use, and made reply:—
<lb/><q>O Shah that art victorious and supreme!
<lb/>Blame not the past. We are thy travail’s dust,
<lb/>The warders of thy treasure. When the king
<lb/>Shall take us into favour we shall cease
<lb/>Both from misfortune and from discontent.
<lb/>The toils that here the king of kings hath borne
<lb/>Are no small matter in the Romans’ eyes,
<lb/>And we will pay, by way of toll and tax,
<lb/>His treasury ten ox-hides of dinars.
<lb/>Tis thine to bid us pay thee less or more,
<lb/>And to accept it though it be unworthy.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>As touching treasure,</q> thus the Shah replied,
<lb/><q>The matter resteth with my minister.</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.53"/>

<p>
<lb/>Then all the Romans went before that archmage,
<lb/>Went with loud lamentations and ill-starred,
<lb/>Used every plea at large, told Caesar’s purpose,
<lb/>Informed him of the ox-hides and dinars,
<lb/>And matters that concerned the peace of Rum.
<lb/>The archmage answered thus: <q>Ye give the gold,
<lb/>But what brocade will ye present as well?

<lb/>What time the king returneth he will need
<lb/>A thousand pieces of gold-woven brocade,
<lb/>For he is constantly concerned with gifts
<lb/>Of robes of honour for his lords and lieges.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Romans gave consent thereto and then
<lb/>Returning did obeisance to the Shah.
<lb/>He tarried on the battlefield awhile.
<lb/>Then when the king and host had taken rest
<lb/>He chose among the troops a warrior—
<lb/>One of ability in ciphering—<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>And gave him soldiers that he might demand
<lb/>The Roman tribute and convey it home.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1781"/>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah departed thence toward Taisafun
<lb/>With troops behind him and in front of him,

<lb/>With silvern bridles and with golden girdles.

<p>
<lb/><q>The air is silken all,</q> thou wouldst have said,

<lb/>When he drew near the city on his march
<lb/>A multitude went out to welcome him.
<lb/>All came to Nushirwan afoot with loins
<lb/>Girt up for service and with open hearts,
<lb/>While all that had accompanied the Shah
<lb/>Proceeded to the palace-gate afoot,
<lb/>And all the mighty chieftains called down blessings
<lb/>Upon that Shah alert and just and holy,

<lb/>While those of greatest eminence brought gifts
<lb/>Of precious stones. The Shah, on his return,

<lb/>And then the warriors went home. There came

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Nushirwan chose Hurmuzd as his Successor</head>

<p>
<lb/>The high-souled minstrel, who instructeth me,
<lb/>What said he of time’s mutability?
<lb/><q>No prudent sage will set his mind and heart
<lb/>Upon this Hostel whence we must depart,
<lb/>For we arise and fall from day to day,
<lb/>And alternate our joyance with dismay.
<lb/>Dark earth will be our final resting-place,
<lb/>This with high honour, that with deep disgrace,
<lb/>And after they depart they tell us not
<lb/>If wakeful joy or slumber be their lot;
<lb/>Still if they flourish not that pass our ken
<lb/>At least they will not strive with death again.
<lb/>In contemplation of that day of awe
<lb/>What are five years and twenty or five score,
<lb/>Passed by one man in pleasure and delight,
<lb/>Passed by another in penurious plight?
<lb/>None have I seen that had a wish to die
<lb/>Among the upright or the waywardly,
<lb/>But all are shocked at death—the pious one,
<lb/>Just as the idol-serving Ahriman.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Old man! when three score years and one have past,


<pb n="8.55"/>


<lb/>Wine, cup, and rest grow savourless at last,
<lb/>Yet wine for one that readieth to die
<lb/>Is as a wool-coat when ’tis winterly,<note>Literally <gloss>In (the month of) Dai.</gloss></note>
<lb/>When body freezeth in the midst of vice,
<lb/>And soul hath lost its way to Paradise.

<lb/>But in the waste the cup with thee will stay.

<lb/>Unless thy life’s endeavour thou forecast
<lb/>Sure retribution will be thine at last.
<lb/>Ill-doing endeth in calamity;
<lb/>If thou dost ill the world will sadden thee.
<lb/>Joy not in evil that thou hast achieved,
<lb/>Who, grieving others, shalt thyself be grieved.
<lb/>Know that, however great may be the sum
<lb/>Of these thine earthly years, thine end will come;
<lb/>So multiply thy good deeds here below
<lb/>That thou mayst gladden when thou hast to go.
<lb/>The deeds accomplished and the words let fall
<lb/>In life will serve as our memorial.
<lb/>I ask of God from time, its Maker He,
<lb/>For such a respite, such felicity,
<lb/>That all these many tales and stories told,
<lb/>Now over-passed by years and waxen old,
<lb/>From Gaiumart to Yazdagird, which be
<lb/>In disarray, may be arrayed by me;
<lb/>That I may range them, weed that garth, and tell
<lb/>Anew what hap the kings of kings befell,
<lb/>Then verily I shall not grieve when I
<lb/>Shall have to quit this Wayside Hostelry.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And now what saith the man of ardent soul
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, the world-lord’s, purposes?
<lb/>The monarch at the age of seventy-four
<lb/>Became possessed by thoughts of death and sought
<lb/>A master for the world whose chiefest aim
<lb/>Should be to clothe him in the robe of justice,


<pb n="8.56"/>


<lb/>Display compassion to the mendicants,
<lb/>Be great, untroubled, and of ardent soul.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He had six sons of noble birth who all
<lb/>Were great, shrewd-hearted, and of kingly mien,
<lb/>With valour, learning, self-control and counsel,
<lb/>Young with a love of knowledge, and of these
<lb/>The wisest and the eldest was Hurmuzd,
<lb/>The nobly born, a man unparalleled,
<lb/>Exalted, knowing, fair of countenance,
<lb/>And well affected to the noble race.<note>i.e., the Persians. Hurmuzd was half Turkish by birth—the son of the daughter of the Khan. See pp. 87, 97 seq.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah gave orders to his officers
<lb/>To test the disposition of his son,
<lb/>By day and night to mark his utterances,
<lb/>And to inform the monarch of the world
<lb/>Of his proceedings whether good or bad.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>At that time said the Shah to Buzurjmihr:—
<lb/><q>I have a secret purpose in my mind.
<lb/>When I exceeded three score years and ten
<lb/>My musky tresses took a camphor-hue,
<lb/>And when I quit this Wayside Hostelry
<lb/>A master will be needed for the world,
<lb/>Who will give largess to the mendicant,
<lb/>The stranger, and the man of his own kindred,
<lb/>Be bounteous, will refrain from love of treasure,
<lb/>And set his heart not on this Wayside Inn—
<lb/>One whose whole purpose ever is toward good,
<lb/>Whose place is on the Shah’s throne. I thank God

<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1783"/>
<lb/>That I have sons wise, learned, who worship Him,
<lb/>And none esteem I dearer than Hurmuzd,
<lb/>Or more pre-eminent for rede and sense.
<lb/>Of mercy, generosity, and right
<lb/>I see naught lacking in his heart at all.
<lb/>So summon now the archmages and the chiefs,
<lb/>All that observe the way of understanding,


<pb n="8.57"/>


<lb/>Prove ye his knowledge and thereby present
<lb/>Accomplishment upon accomplishment.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How the Archimages questioned Hurmuzd and how he replied</head>

<p>
<lb/>The archimages, the investigators,
<lb/>And counsellors assembled, called to them
<lb/>Hurmuzd, the atheling, and seated him
<lb/>Among the chiefs. Then Buzurjmihr began:
<lb/><q>O prince fair-starred and fair to look upon!
<lb/>What know’st thou that will brighten the pure soul
<lb/>And wisdom, and be fruitful for the body?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Knowledge is the best, for great
<lb/>Among the great is one of understanding.
<lb/>In knowledge is man’s safety; it restraineth
<lb/>The hands of Ahriman from ill, and next
<lb/>Come patience and munificence whereby
<lb/>The body gaineth fame and ease.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The sage
<lb/>Then asked: <q>What showeth virtue to advantage,
<lb/>And what will raise a man to high estate?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Hurmuzd replied: <q>First, to be courteous
<lb/>To all in good and ill; next, to endeavour
<lb/>To grieve as little as one can the hearts
<lb/>Of every one; and, thirdly, to deal justly
<lb/>Within the world and so gain self-content.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>On that pure-hearted prince of goodly mien
<lb/>Gazed Buzurjmihr, the questioner, and said:
<lb/><q>Now will I speak concerning needful topics.
<lb/>Count them upon thy hands, remember all
<lb/>That I shall ask, and make a just response
<lb/>To them in that same order. Bring to bear


<pb n="8.58"/>


<lb/>High-mindedness and justice for, if thou
<lb/>Art heedful of such matters, of a truth
<lb/>Heaven’s gate is oped to thee since I will question
<lb/>At large that I may have response in full.

<lb/>The Master of the world instruct thee! May
<lb/>Thy wit be bright, good fortune by thy mate.
<lb/>Now will I question thee of what I know
<lb/>With fairness. Answer as thy knowledge is.
<lb/>The wise man is discerned by his replies,
<lb/>And compasseth his will in everything.

<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1784"/>
<lb/>Inquiry is the lock, response the key;
<lb/>Response discriminateth bad from good.

<lb/>Who is the child dear in his father’s eyes,
<lb/>Fair of behaviour, and without offence?
<lb/>What man is worthy of our heart’s compassion,
<lb/>So that one needs must weep at his distress?
<lb/>What man repenteth of his own good deed,
<lb/>And that too from the bottom of his heart?
<lb/>Who is the man deserving of my blame
<lb/>When I shall make inquiry of his acts?
<lb/>Who would do better if he shunned the world
<lb/>Because his quiet days are at an end?
<lb/>What maketh for our happiness in life,
<lb/>And what do we recall most willingly?
<lb/>Which is the time to praise? What profiteth
<lb/>Us most? Who is the dearest of our friends,
<lb/>Whose voice doth make a pleasance of the heart?
<lb/>Who is the man with most friends in the world,
<lb/>That joy in him in public and in private?
<lb/>Who too is he that hath most enemies,
<lb/>And most malignantly disposed to him?<note>Couplet omitted.</note>

<lb/>What is the thing, the most injurious,
<lb/>For which when done there is good cause to weep?
<lb/>Of all the things that mortals cherish here
<lb/>What is the most unstable of them all?


<pb n="8.59"/>


<lb/>Who is the tyrant that is unashamed,
<lb/>The man most loveless and irreverent?
<lb/>Whose words produce most ruin in the world,
<lb/>And cause the greatest trouble to his friends?
<lb/>What is the matter that entaileth shame,
<lb/>And evil on a man through his own words?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>For one whole day till night rose o’er the hills
<lb/>The sage’s words produced no weariness,
<lb/>But when the darkness brought the time for lights
<lb/>The chiefs’ heads darkened with bewilderment,
<lb/>And, when the Shah grew weary of his words,
<lb/>He paused for a reply. The great Hurmuzd
<lb/>Rose to his feet and fitly praised the Shah:
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>Ne’er may the Shah be lacking to the world,
<lb/>But still abide upon the imperial throne;
<lb/>Ne’er may we see the crown, the royal state,
<lb/>And throne of ivory, devoid of thee;
<lb/>In their excusings may the strong be dust
<lb/>Before thee, heaven thine antidote from harm.

<lb/>Now will I make reply to Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>And solve his questions with a right good will.

<lb/>The sage first questioned me concerning sons,
<lb/>And so it is with them I must begin.
<lb/>A son doth make his father glad of heart,
<lb/>And freeth it from griefs, if he affect
<lb/>His sire, incline to goodness, and be just.

<milestone unit="calced" n="1785"/>
<lb/>Next, of the pitiable man, for whom
<lb/>The eyelids drop their tears: this is the magnate
<lb/>Whose fortune hath been scattered and he now
<lb/>Is thrall to one unworthy. This man’s case
<lb/>Is one to be deplored with bitterness,
<lb/>Because he hath a miscreant for his lord.

<lb/>Again, the man that doeth benefits
<lb/>To thankless folk is all solicitude,
<lb/>And one forgetful of good done to him
<lb/>Would make a fool of wisdom. Then the sage


<pb n="8.60"/>


<lb/>Inquired for whom ’tis goodlier to seek
<lb/>A resting-place by flight from tyranny?
<lb/>The wise man is at liberty to quit
<lb/>The country where the monarch is not just;
<lb/>Escape is needful from an unjust king,
<lb/>Because he bringeth Doomsday on the world.
<lb/>The sage inquired: <q>In what rejoicest thou?</q>
<lb/>Tis in a brother or some charming fere.

<lb/>He then inquired: <q>What is the time to praise?</q>
<lb/>The time when we are quit of enemies:
<lb/>Tis well to praise that ever more and more.
<lb/>Moreover for thy question touching friends,
<lb/>Tis good to have the aidance of all such.
<lb/>If they be wealthy shelter ’neath their cloaks,
<lb/>And toil with them if they be mendicants.

<lb/>The humbler and the nobler that one is
<lb/>The more do his friends’ hearts rejoice in him.
<lb/>The sage next asketh me: <q>Who hath a foe
<lb/>By whom his heart is ever vexed and hurt?</q>
<lb/>The man whose tongue is bold to utter ill
<lb/>Is very apt to make him enemies.<note>Four couplets omitted.</note>

<lb/><q>What is of things the most injurious,</q>
<lb/>Thou saidest, <q>and at last a cause for tears?</q>
<lb/>When passion hath the mastery of thy heart
<lb/>It passeth with the passing of a breath,
<lb/>But with fruition cometh penitence;
<lb/>So handle not the blossom of desire.

<lb/><q>What,</q>he inquired, <q>is that inconstant thing
<lb/>Whose feet I seek to clutch and grasp its head?</q>
<lb/>It is the friendship of a foolish man
<lb/>Of evil nature and unstable counsels;
<lb/>And furthermore he saith: <q>Who is the tyrant
<lb/>That is all shameless and remediless?</q>

<lb/>Call him remediless if he use guile,
<lb/>A tyrant if he acteth shamelessly.


<pb n="8.61"/>


<lb/>As for the man whose very trade is lies,
<lb/>I term him tyrannous and despicable.

<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1786"/>
<lb/><q>Whose words,</q>thou saidest, <q>are the cause of ruin,

<lb/>The traitor and the worthless double dealer
<lb/>Fill wise men’s hearts with pain. The sage inquired:

<lb/><q>What is the fault that causeth one most shame,
<lb/>And maketh him repent of his own words?</q>
<lb/>The foolish talker’s who doth bear himself
<lb/>Vaingloriously within the sight of men,
<lb/>But is, when he is private and alone,
<lb/>Repentant for the words that he hath spoken,
<lb/>Yet, when he next shall speak, will boast again.

<lb/>The man without accomplishment is honoured
<lb/>If he exceedeth not his limitations.
<lb/>Those were the questions, these are my replies.
<lb/>The blessings of the world be on the Shah,
<lb/>May all tongues speak according to his will,
<lb/>And may his noble heart be glad and blest.</q>

<lb/>The king of kings was lost in wonderment
<lb/>At him and lauded him right royally;
<lb/>All were rejoiced that were assembled there,
<lb/>The monarch’s heart was set at large from care.

<p>
<lb/>Then by the Shah’s command they wrote a patent
<lb/>That gave Hurmuzd the throne and crown, and when
<lb/>The wind had dried that paper wrought in Chin


<pb n="8.62"/>


<lb/>They set a seal of musk thereon. The Shah,
<lb/>In presence of the magnates and shrewd sages,
<lb/>Charged the high priest therewith. I, by the grace
<lb/>Of the victorious monarch of the world,
<lb/>Put into verse this act of Nushirwan’s.
<lb/>The world in practice doth belie its show ;
<lb/>Beneath ’tis naught but dolour and chagrin,
<lb/>But, whether thou hast crown or toil and woe,
<lb/>Thou ne’ertheless must quit this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>Peruse a letter of the kings of yore,
<lb/>And see if Nushirwan hath any peer
<lb/>For justice, rede, festivity, and war,
<lb/>Yet, his day done, he found no tarriance here.
<lb/>So turn from feast and pleasure, and be wise,
<lb/>Thou agéd dotard and impenitent !
<lb/>The world may still look freshly to thine eyes
<lb/>When in thy cups thou scornest to repent ;
<lb/>Yet still, if thou be wise, repent anon ;
<lb/>The man of Faith is well advised for aye ;
<lb/>The seasons of thine age will soon be gone,
<lb/>Spring, Summer-tide, and Autumn pass away !
<lb/>Then when thy body is in dust below
<lb/>Think whither that pure soul of thine will go!
<lb/>What was it that the agéd chronicler
<lb/>Said of the testament of Nushirwan ?
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1787"/>

<p>
<lb/>When the responses of Hurmuzd were ended
<lb/>The high priest entered on a new discourse.
<lb/>The Shah bade, and the counsellors and scribes
<lb/>Wrote out on silk a gracious document
<lb/>From Nushirwan to young Hurmuzd, beginning
<lb/>With praise of the All-just and then proceeding :—
<lb/><q>This counsel of the offspring of Kubad
<lb/>Hear graciously and write upon thy heart,
<lb/>Which haply through these words of mine may live.
<lb/>Know that this world is faithless, O my son!
<lb/>And full of toil and trouble, pain and bale.


<pb n="8.63"/>


<lb/>Whenever thou art joying therein and when
<lb/>Thy heart is free from time’s distemperature
<lb/>That happiness hath no abiding-place,
<lb/>And thou must quit this Wayside Hostelry.
<lb/>As I resign the world to thee with justice
<lb/>Thou must thyself resign it to another.
<lb/>Since both by bright day and by longsome night
<lb/>My thoughts are busied with mine own departure
<lb/>I seek a head fit for the royal crown
<lb/>To be a diadem on every head.
<lb/>We have six sons—the Lustre of our heart— .
<lb/>Wise, generous, and just. We have made choice
<lb/>Of thee because thou art the eldest-born,
<lb/>A wise man and the adornment of the crown.
<lb/>Kubad, the well beloved, had four score years
<lb/>What time he spake to me of sovereignty ;
<lb/>Now I have come to seventy years and four,
<lb/>And I have made thee monarch in the world.
<lb/>Herein mine aim hath been but peace and weal
<lb/>So that I might have worship after death.
<lb/>My hope is that almighty God will make thee
<lb/>All glad and fortunate. If by thy justice
<lb/>Folk are secure through thee thou wilt thyself
<lb/>Repose in peace, glad through thine own just dealing,
<lb/>And for thy good works done win Paradise,
<lb/>For he is blest that sowed but seed of good.
<lb/>See that thou ne’er lose patience; haste is ill
<lb/>In kings. The world-lord that is shrewd and learned
<lb/>Will be in estimation all his years.
<lb/>In no way go about to compass lies,
<lb/>Else will the visage of thy fortune pale.
<lb/>Keep haste afar both from thy heart and brain ;
<lb/>The wisdom that is joined to haste will slumber.
<lb/>Incline toward the good and strive therefor,
<lb/>And list the sage’s rede in weal and woe.


<pb n="8.64"/>


<lb/>Ill must not compass thee about, for ill
<lb/>Will verily result in ill to thee.
<lb/>Let both thy raiment and thy food be pure,
<lb/>And keep thy father’s counsels still in mind.
<lb/>Make God thy refuge and incline to Him
<lb/>As thou wouldst have Him for thy guide. When thou
<lb/>Shalt make the world all prosperous by thy justice
<lb/>Thy treasury will prosper, fortune joy
<milestone unit="calced" n="1788"/>

<lb/>In thee. Reward men when they act aright ;
<lb/>Wait not till good men’s toil hath waxen old.
<lb/>Make glad the men of parts and have them near thee,
<lb/>But keep the world dark to the ill-disposed.
<lb/>In all affairs take counsel with the sage,
<lb/>And fret not at the toils of sovereignty.
<lb/>Whenas the wise hath access to thee, throne
<lb/>With troops and treasure will continue thine.
<lb/>As for thy subjects, suffer none of them
<lb/>To be in cheerless case. The potentates
<lb/>And nobles of thy realm must all partake
<lb/>Thy good, but let the ignoble share it not,
<lb/>And trust not aught to one that is unjust.
<lb/>Give all thine ear and heart to mendicants,
<lb/>And let their sorrows be thy sorrows too.
<lb/>The chief that of his own accord is just
<lb/>Will please the world as well as please himself.
<lb/>Bar not thy treasury to men of worth,
<lb/>But act with bounty to the virtuous ;
<lb/>Still if thine enemy become thy friend
<lb/>Sow not thy seed of good on that salt soil.
<lb/>If thou shalt follow this advice of ours
<lb/>Thy crown will be exalted evermore.
<lb/>May He that giveth good wish well to thee,
<lb/>Thy throne be wisdom and thy crown success.


<lb/>God grant that thou mayst not forget my words


<pb n="8.65"/>


<lb/>Though thou be far removed from my sight.
<lb/>May thy head flourish and thy heart be glad,
<lb/>Thy person pure and far from hurt of foes.
<lb/>May wisdom be thy watchman evermore,
<lb/>And righteousness the subject of thy thoughts.
<lb/>When I shall pass away from this wide world
<lb/>A goodly palace must be built for me,
<lb/>Secluded somewhere from the haunts of men,
<lb/>And where the swift-winged vulture flieth not<note>This is not at all in accord to Parsi notions. Cf. Vol. i. p. 81 s.u. Dakhma.</note>—
<lb/>A palace lifted toward revolving heaven,
<lb/>And in its height ten lassoes long and more,
<lb/>And thereupon let there be limned my court,
<lb/>The great men, and the warriors of my host.
<lb/>Let tapestries of every kind be there
<lb/>In plenty, strewings, colour and perfume.
<lb/>Embalm my corpse with camphor and arrange
<lb/>A crown of musk upon the head thereof.
<lb/>Bring forth five pieces never handled yet
<lb/>Of cloth of gold and of brocade of Chin,
<lb/>And garb me in them in the Kaian mode,
<lb/>As is the usance of Sasanian Shahs,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>By which same token make an ivory throne
<lb/>With crown suspended o’er the ivory,
<lb/>And let the golden vessels that I used,
<lb/>The goblets and the censers and the cups—
<lb/>A score filled with rosewater, saffron, wine,
<lb/>Ten score with camphor, musk, and ambergris—
<lb/>Be set upon my left hand and my right,
<lb/>No more or less, for such is my command.


<milestone unit="calced" n="1789"/>


<lb/>Drain from my trunk the blood and afterwards
<lb/>Let the dry space be filled with musk and camphor,
<lb/>And lastly block the passage to my throne—
<lb/>A passage that no other Shah may see.
<lb/>That court will be conducted otherwise,


<pb n="8.66"/>


<lb/>And none will have e’en access unto us.
<lb/>Let those among my sons and noble kin,
<lb/>Who feel my death as a calamity,
<lb/>Refrain from feast and pleasure for two months,
<lb/>For that is usual at the Shah’s decease,
<lb/>And ’twould be seemly for the good to drop
<lb/>A tear on this, the Great King’s, testament.
<lb/>Depart not from the bidding of Hurmuzd
<lb/>And breathe not save according to his will.</q>
<lb/>All o’er that testament shed many a tear,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>How Nushirwan had a Dream and how Buzurjmihr interpreted it as signifying the Appearance of Muhammad</head>
<p>
<lb/>In that year Nushirwan upon a night
<lb/>Amidst his prayers and praises had a dream,
<lb/>Wherein his lucid spirit saw in sleep
<lb/>A Sun rise in the night and therewithal
<lb/>Was an ascent that had two score degrees,
<lb/>Whose summit reached to Saturn in the ascendant.
<lb/>From the Hijaz in stately pomp and joy
<lb/>That Sun ascended that ascent, fulfilling
<lb/>The world with brilliancy from Kaf to Kaf,<note>Kaf=Alburz. See Vol. i. p. 71.</note>
<lb/>And everywhere converting grief to mirth,
<lb/>While all the horizons, whether far or near,
<lb/>Took lustre from its glory everywhere,
<lb/>And everywhere light entered save the hall
<lb/>Of Nushirwan which still abode in gloom.
<lb/>The Shah rose from his sleep for half the night,
<lb/>And oped his lips to none on that affair,


<pb n="8.67"/>


<lb/>But when the sun unveiled its countenance,
<lb/>He summoned to his presence Buzurjmihr.
<lb/>The king of kings in private to that sage
<lb/>Related what he had beheld in sleep,
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr, possessed of all the case,
<lb/>Considered all the dream from end to end,
<lb/>And thus replied: <q>O king of power supreme!
<lb/>In truth there is a mystery herein.</q>
<lb/>The king said: <q>Speak the truth because my life
<lb/>Is failing in my body for suspense.</q>
<lb/>Then Buzurjmihr spake thus: <q>O thou whose rede
<lb/>Is higher than moon and sun! this dream have I
<lb/>Well studied: mark the marvel of its meaning.
<lb/>From this day forth for forty years and more
<lb/>Among the Arabs one will rise to power,

<lb/>Who will adopt the way of righteousness,

<lb/>The observation of the feast of Sada,

<lb/>Folk will no longer worship Fire and Sun,
<lb/>And all the fortunes of the brave will slumber.
<lb/>Jamasp himself declared before Gushtasp
<lb/>This secret, giving this interpretation.</q>
<lb/>When Nushirwan heard this from Buzurjmihr
<lb/>The favour of his countenance was changed;
<lb/>He was all day the mate of pain and grief,
<lb/>And slumbered, when night came, worn out by care.<note>Or, with the change of a diacritical point:— <l>And when the night came, could not sleep for care.</l></note>
<lb/>Now when three watches of the night had passed
<lb/>There went up such a panic-stricken cry
<lb/>That thou hadst said: <q>The world is all o’erturned!</q>
<lb/>And then one said: <q>The hall is rent in twain!</q>
<lb/>Thereat the Shah’s heart started from its place,
<lb/>And in the uttermost bewilderment
<lb/>He spake concerning it to Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Beginning with the rending of the hall,
<lb/>Which when the sage had looked upon he spake
<lb/>On this wise, saying: <q>O Shah Nushirwan!
<lb/>This outcry rose by reason of the Sun
<lb/>That thou beheldest in thy dreams last night.
<lb/>Know that thy palace gave a cry what time
<lb/>That moon-like babe was born, and presently
<lb/>A horseman with two steeds will come to say:—

<lb/>Thereat, as swiftly as the flying dust,

<lb/>What matter this world’s griefs and joys to thee

<p><pb n="8.70"/>Hurmuzd, on succeeding to the throne, makes fair promises but soon belies them and puts to death his father’s ministers. Afterwards, perturbed by a prophecy, he repents, and two stories are told of his even-handed justice.
War breaks out and Bahram Chubina comes upon the scene.
He is appointed commander-in-chief and defeats the Turks under King Sawa and his son Parmuda, but after having been shamefully insulted by the Shah he rebels—a course strongly opposed by his sister Gurda. He contrives to make Hurmuzd suspicious of his own son Khusrau Parviz who escapes. Hurmuzd is dethroned and blinded, and
Khusrau Parviz returns.</p>
</div>



<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>Hurmuzd (Hormisdas IV., A.D. 578-590) may not have been so black as he has been painted but his reign, to say the least of it, stands in melancholy contrast to that of his father whose precepts he disregarded, whose system of administration he did his best to overturn, whose trusted ministers he put to death, and whose practice of personally leading his troops he made no attempt to emulate.<note n="2">RSM, p. 473.</note> He had the good fortune to possess a general at once brave, able, and apparently quite loyal whom he treated with the basest and most insolent ingratitude, wrecking his own

<pb n="8.71"/> reign thereby and inflicting many wounds upon his country.
The romantic history of that general, as told in the Shahnama, is one of the finest passages in the poem, and the poet was fortunate in having such to lay before his readers as he was nearing the end of his great undertaking.<note n="3">See p. 96 seq.</note></p>

<p>Makh, the marchlord of Hardt, who seems to have been known as Khurdasani in accordance to Persian custom in such matters, appears to be the father of, or identical with, one of the four compilers of the prose Shahnama for
Abi Mansur which Firdausi used as his chief authority.
In the Introduction to the present Translation the name of this particular compiler is given, in accordance to the text of C., as Taj son of Khuradsani of Harat<note n="4">Vol. i. p. 67.</note> but according to Noldeke<note n="5">NIN, pp. 14 note 15.</note> the Taj is quite uncertain.</p>

<p>Nushirwan had based his system of administration upon the nobility. We have seen in a characteristic anecdote how he refused to consult his own convenience by accepting a loan of money from a shoemaker.<note n="6">p. 48.</note> Hurmuzd, not having his father’s ability, found the system irksome and consequently was inclined to favour the lower at the expense of the higher orders. Accordingly, later on we have two stories of his even-handed justice.<note n="7">p. 91.</note> A justice, however, which is said to have put to death 13,600 of the nobility and priesthood, and imprisoned or degraded many others in the course of a few years is somewhat suspect.<note n="8">NT, p. 267.</note></p>

<p>Buzurjmihr seems to be identical with Buzurjmihr who, we were told at the end of the last reign,<note n="9">p. 69.</note> died within a month of Nushirwan. According to Masudi Buzurjmihr survived to be the chief minister of Khusrau Parviz who after thirteen years of reign disgraced him and treated him even worse than Nushirwan is said to have done on one occasion,<note n="10">p. 4 seq., MM, ii. 224.</note> the two accounts no doubt being variants of the same story.
Firdausi tells us that one of the three scribes was young,<note n="11">p. 81.</note> and that Buzurjmihr was a youth at his lessons when he first attracted Nushirwan’s attention,<note n="12">Vol. vii. p. 283. Cf. p. 313.</note> He need not have been an old man at the time of that Shah’s death. The probability is, however, that he was executed along with other ministers by Hurmuzd as the text seems to imply.</p>

<pb n="8.72"/>


<p>The account in the Shahnama and in Oriental historians of these wars seems much exaggerated. The war with Rum was nothing new: it had been going on from the days of Nushirwan and was not specially active at the moment. The Arab and Khazar invasions require further confirmation and the latter, it may be suggested, was merely a patriotic invention to cover up an unfortunate incident that befell the Persians South of the Caucasus after the conclusion of the war with the Turks (p. 76). This last war has generally been taken to have been waged between the
Persians and the Khan who was a relation by marriage of
Hurmuzd and would be certain to bring great forces into the field. It appears, however, that Sawa is merely the
Persian form of <q>Chao-wou</q>—the name given in Chinese official reports of the period to the princes of small states on the Oxus that were more or less subject to the Khan who does not appear to have been concerned in the matter at all.<note n="13">NT, p. 269 and notes. RSM, p. 467.</note></p>

<p>In the story of Mihran Sitad’s embassy as given in the Shahnama the prophecy is limited to the outcome of the marriage of Nushirwan with the Khan‘s daughter.<note n="14">Vol. vii. p. 354.</note>
It afforded, however, a convenient starting-point for the
Romance that gathered round the heroic personality of
Bahram Chubina and the reference to him was interpolated accordingly.</p>

<p>Bahram Chubina, whose story and that of his sister
Gurdya extend through the rest of this and far into the succeeding reign, had been marchlord of Rai and governor of the North, apparently, under Nushirwan.<note n="15">ZT, ii. 252. Cf. Vol. vii. p. 214.</note> He continued to hold the same posts under Hurmuzd.<note n="16">ZT, ii. 253.</note> He was a native of Rai, sprung from a race of marchlords and armychiefs, a Mihran, and is said to have been descended from
Gurgin<note n="17">ZT, ii. 252.</note>—all important indications to the student of the
Shahnama. Rai was the traditional seat of Arsacid power.<note n="18">Vol. vi. pp. 201, 215, 223.</note> Shapur of Rai, an army-chief, who was called in by Kubad to overthrow Sifarai of the race of Kawa, also was a Mihran and descended from Mihrak.<note n="19">Vol. vii. pp. 185, 192.</note> The Mihran clan played an important part in Sasanian times and the name often recurs.<note n="20">Id.</note>
Gurgin, son of Milad, was the villain of the story of Bizhan and Manizha.<note n="21">Vol. iii. p. 289 seq.</note> The point is this. The words Milad, Mihrak, and Mihran are closely allied, probably mere variants, are reminiscent of Parthian times and under the Sasanian Dynasty represent the vanquished Arsacid element.<note n="22">Vol. iii. p. 11. vi. 256, vii. 156.</note> That element recovered sufficiently to exercise much political power as in the case of the Mihrans.</p>

<pb n="8.73"/>

<p>A Ruhham of that stock is said to have been influential in placing Piruz upon the throne.<note n="1">Vol. vii. p. 156.</note> If they could not be kings themselves, they aspired to be king-makers and ministers. There was rivalry between them and families of purer Iranian stock, and the Shahs, as in the instance given above, availed themselves of it to serve their own ends. Such rivalry, however, was a subsidiary matter; the great antagonism between Arsacid and Sasanian, though latent, still persisted and is indicated plainly enough in the course of the story of Bahram Chubina.</p>

<p>Noldeke’s account of that story, which is a blend of history and romance, is briefly as follows. It was compiled in Pahlavi shortly before the end of the Sasanian Dynasty, about the beginning of the reign of Yazdagird III., A.D. 632, and was translated into Arabic by a certain Jabala bin Salim of whom nothing more is known save that he was <quote>the writer of Hisham</quote> who can be no other than the Arabic historian Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi. Hisham died about A.D. 820. The story thus became known to the Muhammadans and was woven into the general presentment of Sasanian history.<note n="2">NT, p. 474.</note> We may add that Tabari, who was born some eighteen years after Hisham’s death and died A.D. 923, gives the historical nucleus of the story in his history. The redactor of his work into Persian (A.D. 963) states that as his Arabic authority has not given the life of Bahram Chubina in its entirety he gives it from the book of the history of Persia where he found it more complete.<note n="3">ZT, ii. 253.</note> This version agrees very closely with Firdausi’s. Both are derived from the Persian Book of Kings in one or another of its later forms. Which the redactor of Tabari used we cannot say, but Firdausi, we may assume, used the modern Persian prose Shahnama of Abd Mansur<note n="4">See Vol. i. p. 67.</note> for which a new translation of the story had been made from the <pb n="8.74"/> original Pahlavi.<note n="5">NT, p. 475.</note> This may account for the difference in some of the proper names that exists between Firdausi’s version and that in the Persian Tabari. In this and some other respects the latter is of decided help to the understanding of the former. Attention will be called to such matters in subsequent notes.</p>

<p>It is evident that the redactors of the Pahlavi original into Arabic or Persian took good care to leave little repugnant to Muhammadan Faith or morals. Even the statement in Tabari and its Persian version that Gurdya was the wife as well as the sister of Bahram Chubina<note n="6">NT, p. 279. ZT, ii. 303.</note> disappears in Firdausi.</p>

<p>Yalan-sina—a prominent character in the Romance—is called Mardanshah in the Persian Tabari. He was the brother<note n="7">NT, p. 478.</note> and a firm supporter of Bahram Chubina. Another brother—Gurdwi—took the opposite side and remained loyal to Khusrau Parviz. The sympathies of Gurdya, Bahram Chubina‘s sister, though she associated with him till his death, were also legitimist.</p>

<p>Here we have another instance of a Mihran in high office.<note n="8">Cf. p. 72.</note> Probably he was the successor of Izad Gashasp, the scribe, who had been put to death by Hurmuzd early in his reign<note n="9">p. 83.</note> and is to be carefully distinguished from the general of the same name in Bahram Chubina’s army, which is not always done in the text of C.<note n="10">Cf. pp. 75, 150 note, 158 note.</note></p>

<p>In the Persian Tabari, the purveyor of sheep's heads is said to have been naked and Bahram Chubina to have speared two of the heads, one of which fell back into the tray. The interpretation was that he would have to deal with two kings of whom one would be killed while the other would be restored to his royalty. The nudity signified that Bahram Chubina would revolt.<note n="11">ZT, ii. 258.</note></p>

<p>According to the Persian Tabari, Hurmuzd, on hearing of the invasion of Sawa Shah, sent Kharad, son of Barzin, with an escort to him to delay his advance while the expedition under the command of Bahram Chubina was being got ready. The envoy managed to keep Sawa at Balkh for a whole year.<note n="12">ZT, ii. 259.</note></p>


<p>Faghfur, or Faghfur of Chin, hitherto in the Shahnama a <pb n="8.75"/> dynastic title, here appears as the name of the younger son of Sawa perhaps to add to the latter's importance. In the Persian Tabari the governor of Khurasan takes the part here played by Faghfur.<note n="1">ZT, ii. 259.</note></p>

<p>In the Persian Tabari, Bahram Chubina has the dream while dozing on horseback after having been engaged in arraying the troops all night, and in the same authority bars the road of retreat with five hundred horse,<note n="2">ZT, ii. 261.</note> while the only sorcery is in connection with the dream.</p>

<p>According to Tabari<note n="3">NT, p. 271.</note> the shot that slew king Sawa was one of three that gave renown to archers in Persian story. The others were that of Arish<note n="4">See Vol. v. p. 12.</note> and that of Sufaraf who in the war undertaken to avenge Piruz shot at a chief in the vanguard of Khushnawaz and pierced his horse’s head with an arrow. The chief was taken prisoner by Sutfarat who sent him back to Khushnawaz with instructions to report the matter, and Khushnawaz was so impressed that he sued for peace.<note n="5">NT, p. 127. ZT, ii. 143.</note> Neither of these instances is mentioned in the Shahnama though it celebrates in a famous passage Rustam’s shot in the fight with Ashkabus<note n="6">Vol. iii. pp. 109, 181.</note>, and Bahram Gur’s skill in archery.<note n="7">Vol. vi. p. 383, Vol. vii. pp. 54, 55, 80.</note></p>

<p>Bahram, the son of Sivawush, had married a niece of Bahram Chubina.<note n="8">ZT, ii. 262. Cf. NT, pp. 281, 282 note.</note></p>

<p>The episode of the garden is not in the Persian Tabari.</p>

<p>The above remark applies to the quarrel between Bahram Chubina and Parmida, and to the former’s retention of some of the booty.</p>

<p>The Persian Tabari makes Mardanshah (Yalan-sina), not Izid Gashasp, conduct the Khan, the other prisoners, and the booty to Iran.<note n="9">ZT, ii. pp. 265, 266.</note></p>

<p>The Shahnama here seems to confuse Izid Gashasp with the scribe of that name executed by Hurmuzd.<note n="10">p. 83.</note> It is clear from the Persian Tabari that the person consulted by the Shah about Bahram Chubina was his confidant and minister Ayin Gashasp who in the Persian Tabari<note n="11">ZT, ii. p. 266.</note> is named Yazdanbakhsh. Izid and Yazdan both mean God which also caused confusion and when it became hopeless the form Ayin Gashasp was adopted to get out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>§§ 19-21. <pb n="8.76"/>The definite accusation of withholding some of the booty made by the archscribe (Mihran) against Bahram Chubina is absent in the Persian Tabari which merely gives the vague insinuation of the minister Yazdanbakhsh which rouses suspicion in Hurmuzd’s mind and causes him to send Mardanshah back to the commander-in-chief with a chain, distaff-case, and cotton, and an insulting letter.<note n="12">ZT, ii. p. 266.</note> A similar insult is recorded to have been offered by the Empress Sophia to the exarch Narses when he was superseded and bidden return to his place among the maidens of the palace where a distaff should again be placed in his hand.<note n="13">GDF, v. 336.</note></p>

<p>The treatment of Bahram Chubina by Hurmuzd, though foolish enough in any circumstances, was not quite so unreasonable and motiveless as it appears to be in the accounts of oriental writers. In A.D. 589 after the successful conclusion of Bahram Chubina’s expedition Hurmuzd conceived the idea of renewing the Lazic war which his father had abandoned in A.D. 562,<note n="14">Vol vii, p. 215.</note> and sent Bahram Chubina to conduct the campaign. That chief, however, was defeated by the Romans in a battle on the Araxes and his disgrace followed.<note n="15">NT, p. 272 note. RSM, p. 469.</note></p>

<p>Here for once the Shahnama seems to join hands with Western Romance. The Adventure, mutatis mutandis, reads as if it had been taken bodily from some medieval romance of chivalry.</p>

<p>According to the Persian Tabari, both Kharad, son of Barzin, and the archscribe were present on the occasion.<note n="1">ZT, ii. 267.</note></p>

<p>Here again there seems to be some confusion in connection with Izid Gashasp. He is identified with the archscribe in the heading. Moreover, he is pursued, captured, and brought back to Bahram Chubina, who lets him off very easily, because he is wanted for service with that paladin. In the Persian Tabari, both the fugitives make good their escape to Hurmuzd.<note n="2">ZT, ii. 268.</note> That version does not know of Izid Gashasp, who is mentioned, however, in Tabari.<note n="3">NT, p. 278.</note></p>

<p>In the Persian Tabari, Bahram Chubina sends Hurmuzd twelve thousand hangers with bent points to represent all his twelve thousand troops.<note n="4">ZT, ii. 267.</note></p>

<p>Bahram Chubina is here described as the son of Gashasp. <pb n="8.77"/> Tabari makes him the son of Bahram-Gushnasp,<note n="5">NT, p. 270.</note> the Persian version of Bahram,<note n="6">ZT, ii. 252.</note> and Mas'udi of the nickname—Chubin.<note n="7">MM, ii. 213. Cf. p. 98 note.</note></p>

<p>Izid Gashasp is regarded as dealing with both sides because of the malicious speech that he is represented to have made about Bahram Chubina.<note n="8">p. 150 and note.</note></p>

<p>The debate is not in the Persian Tabari.</p>

<p>The letter to the Khan is not in the Persian Tabari.</p>

<p>Historically, Bahram Chubina issued coins in his own name but apparently not in that of Khusrau Parviz.<note n="9">RSM, p. 471 note.</note></p>

<p>The authorities differ as to whether Gustaham was imprisoned as well as Bandwi. The Oriental say both, the Greek Bandwi only,<note n="10">RSM, p. 471 note.</note> which makes the revolt more intelligible.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How Hurmuzd ascended the Throne and harangued the Chiefs</head>
<p>
<lb/>A marchlord of Harat, well shot in age,
<lb/>There was, in all approven and beseen,
<lb/>A ready speaker, Makh by name, world-sage,
<lb/>Still flourishing and of exalted mien;
<lb/>And it was him I questioned fain to find
<lb/>What record of Hurmuzd he had in mind
<lb/>When that Shah filled the throne of equity:
<lb/>That eld of Khurasan thus answered me:—
<lb/>Whenas that Shah sat on the famous state
<lb/>He first gave praises to almighty God,
<lb/>The Arbiter of fortune, and then said:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1792"/>
<lb/><q>We will renown the throne and hold in honour
<lb/>The men of high degree. We will enfold
<lb/>The world beneath our wings, as did our sire,
<lb/>In goodly case and Glory. We will make
<lb/>Offenders quake and ease the oppressed, be patient
<lb/>If one doth ill and succour him in trouble.
<lb/>The prop of majesty is clemency
<lb/>With bounty, justice, and right conduct. Know
<lb/>That good and evil never are concealed

<pb n="8.79"/>

<lb/>From Him who is the Maker of the world.
<lb/>
<lb/>Our ancestors—crown-wearers in their time,
<lb/>Which through their justice had its share of praise—
<lb/>Sought but for mildness, equity, and greatness,
<lb/>With valour, aptitude, their lieges’ service,
<lb/>
<lb/>Their lords’ observance, and to vex their foes.
<lb/>
<lb/>In every clime to act and to command,
<lb/>
<lb/>Power, counsel, and authority to treat,
<lb/>Are mine. The good affect a heaven-sent Shah.
<lb/>Now mercy is the capital of such;
<lb/>
<lb/>The age becometh full of ease through bounty.
<lb/>The mendicants will I entreat with kindness,
<lb/>
<lb/>And will watch o’er the rich. The self-made man
<lb/>Shall have a prosperous commerce with ourselves.
<lb/>Withhold not your desires from my fond heart;
<lb/>
<lb/>I will abate with ease whatever cause
<lb/>For fear ye entertain. Ye prosperous!
<lb/>
<lb/>Joy in my crown and throne. Amid the great
<lb/>Mine is the lustre in that mercy, justice,
<lb/>
<lb/>And bounty are mine own. Grow still in kindness,
<lb/>And banish greed and vengeance from your hearts.
<lb/>They that fear God will see not evil fortune,
<lb/>
<lb/>So strive ye all, both small and great, to win
<lb/>The favour of the Maker of the world.
<lb/>
<lb/>Again, let not the heart of one possessed
<lb/>Of wisdom contemplate ingratitude,
<lb/>
<lb/>And when thou benefitest other folk
<lb/>Let there be no idea of recompense.
<lb/>
<lb/>Mix not with men that speak deceitfully,
<lb/>For what they utter is for outward show,
<lb/>
<lb/>And if thy king be just think thou no shame
<lb/>Concerning him, for while thou callest him
<lb/>Unwise he may be studious of the words
<lb/>Of former Shahs,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> and when his heart is prompted
<lb/>To mercy sow not thou the seed of guile

<pb n="8.80"/>

<lb/>Upon the earth. The spurner of our counsel
<lb/>Will throw away the benefits of fortune.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1793"/>
<lb/>The approval of thy Shah sufficeth thee,
<lb/>While to resist him is the road to ruin.
<lb/>His harshness in exhorting thee is kind,
<lb/>For he would break with thee if he were wroth.
<lb/>Begrudge no efforts in the cause of good,
<lb/>And joy not in injustice and in wealth.
<lb/>When in the world thou hast thy heart’s desire,
<lb/>And reached what thou wast instant to attain,
<lb/>Still, when thou don’st the crown of seventy years,
<lb/>Thou yieldest all thy winnings to the foe.
<lb/>My heart is greatly troubled for the poor,
<lb/>And I would have them ever in my thoughts.
<lb/>I ask the holy Fosterer for time
<lb/>To render poor folk happy with my treasures;
<lb/>I will not bring the saintly heart to trouble.
<lb/>If any by his monetary wealth
<lb/>Shall grow too kinglike him will I abase:
<lb/>No rival will I have. From first to last,
<lb/>In public utterance and secret thought,
<lb/>We are the same. The Maker’s benison
<lb/>Be yours, your earth the circling vault of heaven.</q>
<lb/>Now when the assembly heard his words each man
<lb/>Grew thoughtful, those of wealth were filled with fear,
<lb/>And tyrants’ hearts were rent, while for their part
<lb/>The sage and mendicant waxed glad of heart.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How Hurmuzd slew Izid Gashasp, Zarduhsht,
Simadh Barzin and Bahram Azarmidokht, his
Father's Ministers<note n="1">The heading in the original seems to have been carelessly compiled. The one above has been adopted to suit the account in the text.</note></head>
<p><pb n="8.81"/>
<lb/>The Shah ruled well until he felt secure
<lb/>And had attained his ends but then he raged,
<lb/>Displayed his evil nature, left the path
<lb/>Of right and, as he had determined, slew
<lb/>Those most in honour with his father—men,
<lb/>Who, innocent and happy, feared no ill.

<lb/>Among the scribes of Nushirwan were three,
<lb/>Two old, one young, their names Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>Burzmihr—a learnéd scribe of Grace and presence—
<lb/>And Mah Azar, wise, shrewd, and prosperous.
<lb/>The three had been vizirs and ministers
<lb/>Before the throne of Nushirwan. Hurmuzd
<lb/>Was longing to bring ruin on all three
<milestone unit="calced" n="1794"/>
<lb/>Because he feared that they might prove ingrate.
<lb/>Without a cause he raised his hand against
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, bound and imprisoned him.
<lb/>
<lb/>The high priest’s heart was straitened and his cheek
<lb/>Wan with anxiety, for he was good,
<lb/>An ancient named Zarduhsht, and at the bondage
<lb/>Of scribe Izid Gashasp it was as though
<lb/>His own heart had been arrow-pierced.

<pb n="8.82"/>

<lb/>Now when
<lb/>Izid Gashasp had passed a day untended,
<lb/>Without food, clothes or solacer, a friend
<lb/>Conveyed for him this message from the prison
<lb/>To the high priest: <q>O thou that to the captive
<lb/>Art skin and marrow! here am I within
<lb/>
<lb/>The prison of the Shah without attendance,
<lb/>And none can come to me. I crave for food;
<lb/>A famished paunch increaseth my distress.
<lb/>Send to me what is fit and, when I die,
<lb/>
<lb/>Some linen<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> and a stitcher for my shroud.</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>The high priest’s heart was grieved at his affliction,
<lb/>His message, place, and lodging. He replied:—
<lb/><q>Complain not of the matter of thy bondage
<lb/>If thou art not in jeopardy of life.</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>Albeit the message left him broken-hearted,
<lb/>And troubled for himself. He thought: <q>If news
<lb/>Shall reach this Graceless and ungenerous Shah
<lb/>That his high priest hath sent things to the prison,
<lb/>My life and body are not worth a mite;
<lb/>
<lb/>This world-lord will destroy me and will turn
<lb/>A livid face toward me in his wrath.</q>
<lb/>Yet through affection for Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>The scribe, his heart was wrung, his face like gall.
<lb/>He bade his heedful cook take to the prison
<lb/>Food for the prisoner and afterwards
<lb/>Gat on an Arab steed and went to him.
<lb/>The keeper of the prison paled with fright,
<lb/>On seeing the high priest, but dared not say:—
<lb/><q>Go not within the prison for this king
<lb/>Is self-willed and a novice.</q>
<lb/>Bathed in tears
<lb/>That agéd man alighted from his steed,
<lb/>And visited Izid Gashasp. They clasped
<lb/>Each other in a close embrace, all anguish,
<lb/>The lashes of their eyes like clouds in Spring,
<lb/>And held talk of the Shah’s malignity
<lb/>Until words failed them. Then the board was spread
<lb/>Before those holy men who next began

<pb n="8.83"/>

<lb/>To mutter prayers with sacred twigs in hand,
<lb/>And afterwards Izid Gashasp in whispers
<lb/>Conveyed his wishes, while the high priest hearkened,
<lb/>As to his hoarded treasure and dinars,
<lb/>His mansions, palaces, and property,
<lb/>And said: <q>O noble man! on going hence
<milestone unit="calced" n="1795"/>
<lb/>Say to Hurmuzd from me: <q>Though thou mayst spurn
<lb/>My words yet think upon the toils and care
<lb/>That I supported with Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And how I cherished thee too on my breast.
<lb/>My recompense is chains and fear of worse,
<lb/>And I shall show God on the Judgment Day
<lb/>A guiltless heart aggrieved against the king.</q> </q>
<lb/>Now when the high priest had gone home a spy
<lb/>Departed hastily and told the news
<lb/>To Shah Hurmuzd whose heart conceived fell schemes.
<lb/>He did not spare Izid Gashasp but sent,
<lb/>And slew him in the prison, heard reports
<lb/>At large about the high priest, made no sign,
<lb/>And pondered how by fair means or by foul
<lb/>To slay him; then gave orders to the cook
<lb/>To mingle bane in secret with some dish,
<lb/>And when the high priest came at audience-time
<lb/>To pay his duty to the illustrious king,
<lb/>Hurmuzd said: <q>Tarry here to-day for I
<lb/>Have a new cook.</q>
<lb/>The high priest sat; they spread
<lb/>The board; he paled; he felt that ’twas his last,
<lb/>And so it proved. The cooks brought up the meats,
<lb/>And Shah Hurmuzd partook of all in turn,
<lb/>But when he had the poisoned dish brought in
<lb/>The high priest glanced thereat and looked again.
<lb/>There was an ill surmise in his pure heart:—

<pb n="8.84"/>

<lb/><q>His remedy is poison in that dish!</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>Hurmuzd, on seeing this, said not a word,
<lb/>But stretched his hand out to that dish of bane,
<lb/>And, in accordance to the use of kings
<lb/>When paying servants honour and regard,
<lb/>Put his own noble fingers to the board,
<lb/>And, having taken marrow from the dish, said to the high priest: <q>O thou honest man!
<lb/>I made this luscious morsel for thyself,
<lb/>So open wide thy mouth and take this food,
<lb/>And such should be thy nourishment henceforth.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage answered: <q>By thy life and head,
<lb/>And may thy head and crown endure forever,
<lb/>Bid me not eat it; I have had enough,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>So do not press me further.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Hurmuzd:—
<lb/><q>By sun and moon, and by the purity
<lb/>Of soul of him who is the Shah and world-lord,
<lb/>Thou shalt accept this morsel from my hand,
<lb/>And frustrate not my wish herein.</q>
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/>
<lb/><q>The Shah hath bidden and I have no choice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He ate, then left the board, in sore distress,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1796"/>
<lb/>And hurried home, spake of the poisoned food
<lb/>To none but spread a robe and lay lamenting.
<lb/>He ordered one to fetch an antidote
<lb/>From those old hoards of his or from the city,
<lb/>But it availed not aught, and bitterly
<lb/>Complained he unto God against Hurmuzd.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah dispatched a trusty man to learn
<lb/>The high priest’s state, the action of the poison,
<lb/>And if the scheme had failed. Now when the eye
<lb/>Of the high priest beheld the messenger
<lb/>Tears fell from his eyelashes down his cheeks.
</p>

<pb n="8.85"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Go, tell Hurmuzd,</q> he said: <q>Thy fortune changeth.
<lb/>Hereafter, through thy mischievous designs,
<lb/>Thou shalt be blind and shiftless in the world,
<lb/>Thy foes shall have their hearts’ desire upon thee,
<lb/>And lasting shame shall dog thy soul for this.
<lb/>Soon wilt thou die and leave an evil name.
<lb/>I go to lay my cause before the Judge,
<lb/>Where we shall face each other. Never more
<lb/>Sleep free from ill, for chastisement divine
<lb/>Confronteth thee. I take my leave of thee,
<lb/>Malignant man! Ill done will bring thee ill.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The trusty envoy heard and went with tears
<lb/>To take the king the message. He repented,
<lb/>Writhed at the high priest’s righteous words but saw
<lb/>No way to cure that smart and deeply sighed.
<lb/>Anon the high priest died, and all the wise
<lb/>Wept o’er him sorely. In this world of pain
<lb/>And toil why court renown and clutch at gain?
<lb/>The wise count breaths because no joys remain.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The high priest’s wretched end convulsed the realm
<lb/>With grief, but that blood-shedding, brutal worldlord
<lb/>Recked not of evil fortune, girt his loins
<lb/>For bloodshed, made Bahram Azarmihan
<lb/>His tool, called him by night and made him kneel
<lb/>Beside the throne, then said: <q>Thou wouldst feel safe
<lb/>From evil treatment at my hands? Then when
<lb/>The sun is bright in heaven, and mountain-tops
<lb/>Are shining like a back-plate, come among
<lb/>The nobles of Iran and take thy stand
<lb/>Before my throne. Then will I question thee
<lb/>About Simah Barzin: make answer boldly.
<lb/>I shall inquire: <q>What is this friend of thine,

<pb n="8.86"/>

<lb/>An evil man or one that serveth God?</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1797"/>
<lb/>Reply: <q>He is an evil man, a villain,
<lb/>And sprung from Ahriman.</q> Then ask whatever
<lb/>Thou wilt—a handmaid, signet, throne, and crown.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>I will, and multiply
<lb/>The ill a hundredfold.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah thus sought
<lb/>An artifice to put Simah Barzin,
<lb/>One of the chiefs, beloved by Nushirwan—
<lb/>That Lustre of the age—beyond the pale
<lb/>Of sympathy.
<lb/>Now when the Robe whose hue
<lb/>
<lb/>Is ivory-bright grew visible, and Sol
<lb/>Rose in the Sign of Gemini, the world-lord
<lb/>Sat on the ivory throne, and o’er his head
<lb/>They hung the costly crown. The Iranian chiefs
<lb/>Met and drew up in rank before the court-gate.
<lb/>The audience-chamberlain withdrew the curtain,
<lb/>And all the throng approached the king. First came
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan, Simah Barzin,
<lb/>And valiant chiefs. Each took his proper seat,
<lb/>The crowd still standing in the monarch’s presence,
<lb/>Who questioned thus Bahram Azarmihan:—
<lb/><q>Now doth Simah Barzin, in presence here,
<lb/>Deserve our wealth or is he troublesome,
<lb/>Because the ill-disposed deserve not treasure?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan well understood
<lb/>The question of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Its base and motive: <q>We must weep therefor,
<lb/>And from the ruler of the people I
<lb/>Shall have at last a charnel but no shroud!</q>
<lb/>And thus he made response: <q>O noble Shah!
<lb/>Look for no goodness from Simah Barzin,
<lb/>For he hath wrecked Iran. Would that his body
<lb/>Had neither brain nor skin! He speaketh naught
<lb/>But villainy and thus produceth strife.</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.87"/>

<p>
<lb/>Simah Barzin, on hearing this, replied:—
<lb/><q>My good old friend! defame not thus my person,
<lb/>And be not thus confederate with the Div.
<lb/>Since thou hast been my friend what words and deeds
<lb/>Of Ahriman hast thou perceived in me?</q>
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan thus answered him:—
<lb/><q>Thou hast been scattering seed throughout the world,
<lb/>And thou wilt be the first to reap the crop.
<lb/>Black smoke shall be thy portion of the fire,
<lb/>For Nushirwan once summoned thee and me,
<lb/>And made us kneel before the royal throne
<lb/>With the high priest, Burzmihr, and with that chief
<lb/>Of comely face, Izid Gashasp, and asked:—
<lb/><q>Who doth deserve the imperial throne and who
<lb/>Possesseth Grace? On younger son or elder
<lb/>Shall I bestow it? Which is worthier
<lb/>Of kingship?</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1798"/>
<lb/>
<lb/>Then the rest of us arose,
<lb/>And framed our tongues to utter this reply:—
<lb/><q>This man of Turkman kindred is unworthy;
<lb/>None would give aught for such a Shah, for he
<lb/>Is Khan-descended, is of evil nature,
<lb/>And like his mother both in looks and bearing.</q>
<lb/>Thou saidst: <q>Hurmuzd is fit to be the Shah,</q>
<lb/>And now art guilty of the consequence.
<lb/>For this cause have I testified against thee,
<lb/>And opened thus my lips in thy dispraise.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuzd at that archmage’s truthful words
<lb/>Turned pale with shame. At night he sent them both
<lb/>To prison and for two nights made no sign
<lb/>Withal, but on the third, what time the moon
<lb/>Arose above the mountains, he dispatched
<lb/>Simah Barzin by slaying him within


<pb n="8.88"/>


<lb/>The prison of the thieves yet gat thereby
<lb/>But toil and malison. On hearing how
<lb/>That man of honest heart had passed away
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan sent to the Shah
<lb/>A message saying: <q>Thou whose crown is over
<lb/>The orbit of the moon! thou knowest how much
<lb/>I have endured to keep thy secrets close,
<lb/>And ne’er was aught but well disposed to thee
<lb/>Before thy father, that illustrious Shah.
<lb/>
<lb/>If thou wilt summon me and make me sit
<lb/>Beside the royal throne I will reveal
<lb/>A matter to thee in thine interest.
<lb/>Free me at once from bondage in the prison;
<lb/>’Twill help Iran and keep the wise unscathed.</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>Hurmuzd, when this came, chose a confidant
<lb/>To bring Bahram Azarmihan to him,
<lb/>And to that court renowned. The monarch summoned
<lb/>Bahram Azarmihan when it was night,
<lb/>Caused him to kneel before the royal throne,
<lb/>And then said: <q>Tell me what this matter is
<lb/>That will secure my life in happiness.</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>He answered: <q>In the royal treasury
<lb/>I have observed a plain black cabinet.
<lb/>Deposited within it is a casket,
<lb/>And therein is a document in Persian.
<lb/>’Tis written on white silk: the Iranians’ hopes
<lb/>Are centred there. ’Twas written by thy sire,
<lb/>That Shah and world-lord, and thou shouldest see it.</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>Then to his treasurer, good at need, Hurmuzd
<lb/>Sent one to say: <q>Seek in the ancient hoards
<lb/>A plain sealed cabinet and on the seal
<lb/>The name of Nushirwan, and may his soul
<lb/>Be ever young! Dispatch and bring it me
<lb/>Ere night be past.</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.89"/>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1799"/>
<p>
<lb/>The treasurer was prompt,
<lb/>And brought it with the seal intact. The world-lord
<lb/>Oped it, invoking oftentimes the while
<lb/>The name of Nushirwan. He saw within
<lb/>A casket, which was also sealed, wherefrom
<lb/>He eagerly took forth the piece of silk,
<lb/>And saw the characters of Nushirwan
<lb/>Inscribed thereon, and thus the writing ran:

<lb/>On seeing that script, and in his father’s hand,
<lb/>Hurmuzd was frayed and rent the silk asunder.

<lb/>What time the moon rose o’er the mountain-tops,
<lb/>The deathsman slew him. At the court no sage

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Hurmuzd turned from Tyranny to Justice</head>
<p>
<lb/>From that time forth he led a goodlier life,
<lb/>Moved by remorse at heart. Now every year,
<lb/>When nights were short, he sojourned at Istakhr
<lb/>Two months because that city was delightsome,
<lb/>The air serene: he knew not how to quit it.
<lb/>He and his court were wont to spend three months
<lb/>At Ispahan with its delicious air—
<lb/>The seat of mighty men. In Winter-time
<lb/>He dwelt at Taisafun among the troops,
<lb/>The archimages and the counsellors;
<lb/>While in the Spring he was upon the plain
<lb/>Of the Arwand, and thus a while went by.
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1800"/>
<p>
<lb/>His heart was terror-stricken by that scroll,
<lb/>He spent three watches of the night in prayer,
<lb/>Shed no more blood thenceforth and did no wrong:
<lb/>His soul mused not of ill. Whene’er the Veil
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli was hidden, and when
<lb/>The topaz height appeared, a herald used
<lb/>Thus to proclaim: <q>Famed men of Grace and prudence!
<lb/>
<lb/>If tilth be trampled and the sower troubled
<lb/>By that mishap, or if a horse shall enter
<lb/>Crops, or if any one withal shall trespass
<lb/>On orchards, then the horse’s tail and ears
<lb/>Must be cut off and the thief's head be set

<pb n="8.91"/>

<lb/>Upon the stake.</q><note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>He had a son beloved,
<lb/>Just like the moon, whom he had named Parwiz,
<lb/>And sometimes called <q>Khusrau the well-content.</q><note>The prince afterwards famous as Shah Khusrau Parwiz.</note>
<lb/>He never left his father’s side for long;
<lb/>The father never bloomed without the son.
<lb/>It chanced that the young steed of prince Parwiz
<lb/>Escaped from stall and followed by its groom
<lb/>Went to the growing crops whose owner came
<lb/>Lamenting to the groom and asked: <q>What man
<lb/>Must sorrow for this horse’s ears and tail?</q>
<lb/>The groom said: <q>’Tis the horse of prince
<lb/>Parwiz;
<lb/>What careth he for subjects?</q>
<lb/>Then the owner
<lb/>Went to the king and laid the case before him,
<lb/>Who said: <q>Haste, dock the horse’s tail and ears,
<lb/>Then have the damage to the crop assessed,
<lb/>And prince Khusrau shall recompense the man
<lb/>A hundredfold in money from his treasures
<lb/>Upon the field and in its owner’s presence.</q>
<lb/>Thereat the prince moved chiefs to plead for him
<lb/>Before the Shah that he would not have docked
<lb/>The black steed’s tail and ears, but in his wrath
<lb/>Against the steed the king paid no regard
<lb/>To all those men of world-experience;
<lb/>The groom through terror of the king made haste
<lb/>To dock the young steed of its ears and tail
<lb/>Upon that tilth betrampled; and Khusrau
<lb/>Paid the complainant what the Shah had bidden.

<p>
<lb/>Anon the king went hunting, and they all
<lb/>Had much good sport. A valiant warrior,
<lb/>Whose father was the captain of the host,
<lb/>Saw, as he went along, a vine well laden

<pb n="8.92"/>

<lb/>With unripe grapes and bade his servant haste
<lb/>To cut and take some bunches to his cook.
<lb/>The owner came and said: <q>Thou miscreant!
<lb/>Thou neither wast the tender of this vine,
<lb/>
<lb/>Nor boughtest it with treasure and dinars!
<lb/>Why hast thou spoiled the labour of another?
<lb/>I shall complain of thee before the Shah.</q>
<lb/>
<lb/>The valiant horseman, fearing what might chance,
<lb/>Undid his belt forthwith and then bestowed it,
<lb/>All costly and all golden with each link
<lb/>Inlaid with gems, upon the man who said
<lb/>On seeing it: <q>What wrong one must condone!
<lb/>Tell not the king. Thou hast no purchaser
<lb/>In me, so make it no affair of price;

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How Hosts gathered from all Sides against Hurmuzd, and how he took Counsel with his Wazirs</head>
<p>
<lb/>When he had reigned for ten years righteously
<lb/>The voice of foemen rose from every realm,
<lb/>King Sawa marched upon him from Harat
<lb/>With drums and treasure, elephants and troops.
<lb/>If thou wouldst take the number of that host
<lb/>Go count four hundred o’er a thousand times.
<lb/>There were twelve hundred elephants of war ;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q> Earth hath no room for them.</q>
<lb/>The desert from Harat to the Marvrud<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Was thick as warp and woof with soldiery,
<pb n="8.93"/>
<lb/>And as he led them on to Marv the earth
<lb/>Was hidden by the dust-clouds of the host.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1802"/>
<lb/>King Sawa wrote a letter to Hurmuzd,
<lb/>And said: <q>Convoke thy powers from every side,
<lb/>Repair the roads and bridges for my troops,
<lb/>Get provand and bethink thee of my sword.
<lb/>I would pass through thy realm. Mine army reacheth
<lb/>O’er river, height, and waste.</q>
<lb/>On reading this
<lb/>The king turned pale at all that countless host.
<lb/>Then from another quarter Caesar came,
<lb/>And over-ran the land with his array—
<lb/>A force of Rumans five score thousand strong,
<lb/>Courageous and redoubted cavaliers.
<lb/>The cities ta’en by Nushirwan, whose name
<lb/>Still frighted him, he took back with the sword :
<lb/>All were again obedient unto Caesar.<note>Couplet inserted from P. and one omitted.</note>
<lb/>A host came from the side of the Khazars,
<lb/>And all the fields and fells were black with them.
<lb/>A warrior of experience and possessed
<lb/>Of troops and treasure of his own was leader,
<lb/>And from Armenia their companies
<lb/>Extended to the gate of Ardabil.
<lb/>Then from the waste of spear-armed cavaliers
<lb/>An army came past count. Abbas and Amr,
<lb/>Two horsemen youthful and illustrious,
<lb/>Led them. They gave to havoc land and crop
<lb/>Because Hurmuzd demanded tribute of them.
<lb/>That host reached the Farat, and in that land
<lb/>No place for grass was left. When fortune loured
<lb/>News reached Hurmuzd, and that successful Shah
<lb/>Grew all amort at his informants’ words,
<lb/>And he repented slaying those archmages,
<lb/>And alienating wise men from his court.
<lb/>He saw no counsellor, and he had need
<pb n="8.94"/>
<lb/>Of wise advisers, so he sent and summoned
<lb/>The Iranians to full session in the palace,
<lb/>And made discovery of all the matter,
<lb/>Addressing thus those nobles of the land :—
<lb/><q> A greater host than any can recall
<lb/>Is marching on Iran.</q>
<lb/>Then all the marchlords
<lb/>Approached him with suggestions, saying thus :—
<lb/><q> Advised and prudent Shah! hear us herein.
<lb/>Thou art a wise Shah; we are subjects merely,
<lb/>And count ourselves as less than one archmage.
<lb/>Thy scribes and thine archmages hast thou slain,
<lb/>Departing from both faith and precedent.
<lb/>Think what to do and who shall guard our land.</q>
<lb/>Then said an archimage who was wazir :—
<lb/><q>O sage and knowledge-seeking Shah! if now
<milestone unit="calced" n="1803"/>
<lb/>The host of the Khazars come forth to battle
<lb/>Our warriors will be fully occupied.<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">tes vaillantes troupes n’hésiteront pas un instant.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Let us make overtures to them of Rum,
<lb/>And then pluck up the Arabs by the root.
<lb/>King Sawa is more instant and with him
<lb/>Our prospect is more gloomy too. Our trouble
<lb/>Will come by way of Khurasan for he
<lb/>Will waste our country and our wealth withal ;
<lb/>So when the Turkman marcheth from Jihun
<lb/>To war there must be no delay.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuzd,
<lb/>For he was seeking for a policy,
<lb/>Said to that archimage: <q>‘ How shall we now
<lb/>Bear us toward king Sawa ?</q>
<lb/>He replied :—
<lb/><q>Put thine own soldiers into war-array,
<lb/>For troops exalt a monarch. Summon too
<lb/>The muster-master that he may account
<lb/>The number fit for service.</q>
<pb n="8.95"/>
<lb/>With the roll
<lb/>The muster-master came before the Shah,
<lb/>Whose army numbered five score thousand men,
<lb/>The more part mounted, many were on foot.
<lb/>The archmage said: <q> With such a host as this
<lb/>We well may be defeated by king Sawa
<lb/>Unless thou actest boldly and uprightly,
<lb/>Dismissing all ideas of fraud and falsehood ;
<lb/>Then thou wilt free thy subjects’ heads from bonds
<lb/>As well becometh kingship. Thou hast heard
<lb/>The mighty tale of ill done to Gushtasp,
<lb/>And to Luhrasp all for religion’s sake
<lb/>By great Arjasp, that brave old Wolf, and all
<lb/>The cavaliers of Chin, the woe of Balkh,
<lb/>And how life was embittered in that land
<lb/>Until Asfandiyar was set at large,
<lb/>And pressed the war amain.<note>See Vol. v. p. 35 seq.</note> Unless the king
<lb/>Of earth will be advised he will behold
<lb/>Much trouble from the Turks of Chin, but though
<lb/>I pass the king in years I pass him not
<lb/>In thought.</q>
<lb/>The king said: <q> Caesar shall not fight
<lb/>With us. I will restore the cities taken
<lb/>By Nushirwan, and then he will withdraw.</q>
<lb/>He chose a scribe—a warrior—as envoy,
<lb/>A wise, a prudent, and observant man,
<lb/>And sent him unto Caesar with this message :—
<lb/><q>I want no Roman cities; be that land
<lb/>Thine ; but withal set foot not on our coasts
<lb/>If thou wouldst be both great and prosperous.</q>
<lb/>The envoy came to Caesar and delivered
<lb/>The message of Hurmuzd. The lord of Rum
<lb/>Withdrew and did no scath upon Iran.
<lb/>The king, when Caesar had withdrawn, prepared
<lb/>To war with the Khazars. He formed a host,
<pb n="8.96"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1804"/>
<lb/>Whose dust-clouds blotted day, and sent it thither
<lb/>To fire those fields and fells, led by Kharrad—
<lb/>A man of Grace, of worship, and of justice.
<lb/>Now when that army reached Armenia
<lb/>The host of the Khazars barred all the way.
<lb/>The Iranians slaughtered many and bare off
<lb/>Much spoil. The Arabs hearing this were checked,
<lb/>And went back whence they came. So when the Shah
<lb/>Heard that Kharrad had been victorious
<lb/>Naught but to fight king Sawa still remained,
<lb/>To which endeavour all his thoughts were strained.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>How Hurmuzd heard of Bahram Chubina and sent for him</head>
<p>
<lb/>A servant of the Shah’s, one hight Nastuh,
<lb/>A wise, successful, and observant man,
<lb/>Spake thus: <q>O Shah! be happy. May the hand
<lb/>Of ill be ever far from thee! My sire,
<lb/>The wise Mihran Sitad, hath still his wits,
<lb/>Though old, and sitteth with the Zandavasta
<lb/>In his retirement, having naught to hope for
<lb/>Through age and weakness. Now but recently
<lb/>I went and spent a day and night with him,
<lb/>Told him about king Sawa, his vast host,
<lb/>And elephants of war. My father said :—
<lb/><q> The ancient prophecy is then fulfilled ! </q>
<lb/>I questioned him: <q> To what referrest thou ? </q>
<lb/>He answered: <q> If the Shah shall ask of me
<lb/>I will reveal it.</q> </q>
<lb/>Then the king of kings
<pb n="8.97"/>
<lb/>Commanded that a noble should set forth
<lb/>In haste and fetch the old man from his palace
<lb/>Upon a litter. When that ancient came,
<lb/>His heart all knowledge and his head all lore,
<lb/>Before the Shah, Hurmuzd inquired of him :—
<lb/><q>What know’st thou of the past ? </q>
<lb/><q>O fluent Shah,
<lb/>And heedful,</q> said the elder, <q> when the Khan
<lb/>Dispatched thy mother to Iran from Chin
<lb/>I was the chief of eight score warriors
<lb/>That went to ask of him her hand in marriage.
<lb/>Thy father, that most upright king of kings,
<lb/>Demanded no slave’s daughter of the Khan,
<lb/>But said: <q>Require a daughter of the queen ;
<lb/>No slave must be the consort of the Shah.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1805"/>
<lb/>I went before the Khan and did obeisance.
<lb/>He had five daughters in his women’s bower,
<lb/>All goodly, fit to deck the thrones of monarchs,
<lb/>In gait like pheasants and in looks like Spring,
<lb/>And all fulfilled with colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The monarch sent me to their bower. I entered
<lb/>That famed court. They had decked the daughters’ faces,
<lb/>And twined their locks with roses, save thy mother
<lb/>Who wore no coronet, no necklace, bracelet,
<lb/>Or other ornament but sat there mute
<lb/>With hanging head and shyly hid her face
<lb/>Behind her sleeves; but she alone of all
<lb/>Was daughter of the queen; none of the rest
<lb/>Possessed such elegance, such bloom, and charm
<lb/>Because the queen was daughter of Faghfur,
<lb/>And naturally indisposed to ill.
<lb/>She sorrowed that her child should dwell afar,
<lb/>And that pure daughter quit the monarch’s palace.
<lb/>Among those daughters her it was I chose ;
<lb/>I heeded not the others. Said the Khan :—
<pb n="8.98"/>
<lb/><q>Select another; all the five are fair
<lb/>And worshipful,</q> and this was my response :—
<lb/><q>My choice is made; to choose again were fatal.</q>
<lb/>Then summoned he his priests and made them kneel
<lb/>Before the royal throne and asked concerning
<lb/>His daughter’s future. Those astrologers
<lb/>Replied: <q>Thou shalt see naught but good and hear
<lb/>Naught but the truth. From her and from the Shah
<lb/>A prince like some fierce lion will be born,
<lb/>Of lofty stature and with lusty limbs,
<lb/>Brave as a lion, bounteous as a cloud,
<lb/>Black-eyed, impetuous, and choleric,
<lb/>Who, on his father’s death, will be the king.
<lb/>He will enjoy much treasure from his sire,
<lb/>And in his latter days refrain from evil.
<lb/>Thereafter will a mighty king arise,
<lb/>Lead forth a valiant host of Turks and seek
<lb/>With that array to occupy Iran
<lb/>And country of Yaman throughout. The Shah
<lb/>Will be in dudgeon at him and will fear
<lb/>His high, victorious fortune, but will have
<lb/>Far off a subject, an exalted horseman
<lb/>And loyal liege, tall and adust of body,
<lb/>Upon his head crisp locks as black as musk,
<lb/>Big both of bone and nose and swart of skin—
<lb/>A warrior brave and strong, nicknamed Chubina,<note>i.e., Stick-like.</note>
<lb/>And sprung from paladins. This strenuous man
<milestone unit="calced" n="1806"/>
<lb/>Will come with some few soldiers to the Shah,
<lb/>Soon overthrow this Turk and wreck his host.</q>
<lb/>Ne’er saw I one more glad than was the Khan
<lb/>On hearing this. He gave the Crown of all
<lb/>His daughters unto Nushirwan while I
<lb/>Received her on the Shah's behalf. This done
<pb n="8.99"/>
<lb/>I hied me home, the Khan producing for us
<lb/>Such wealth of jewels from his treasury
<lb/>That we were put to it to carry them.
<lb/>He came with me as far as the Jihun,
<lb/>Embarked his daughter and with doleful heart
<lb/>Turned back, at one with sorrow for his child.
<lb/>Now have I told my tale here in thy presence,
<lb/>O king of men! Seek for the man himself
<lb/>Within thy realm and bid thy couriers haste
<lb/>Because thy triumph lieth in his hands,
<lb/>But tell not friend or foe.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>E’en with the words
<lb/>He yielded up the ghost, and all the folk
<lb/>Bewailed him bitterly. The king of kings
<lb/>Was all astound and poured down tears of blood.
<lb/><q>Mihran Sitad,</q> he told the Iranians,
<lb/><q>Retained this story in his memory,
<lb/>And after having told it to us died,
<lb/>Committing his accepted soul to God,
<lb/>And God be thanked that this old man hath uttered
<lb/>Words of such import. Had I fetched him hither
<lb/>But one hour later he had died and I
<lb/>Had seen much grief. Our realm must now be searched
<lb/>For this man whether he be lord or liege.
<lb/>Seek indefatigably for this one
<lb/>Until ye find him.</q>
<lb/>An illustrious subject,
<lb/>The master of the horse, named Zaed Farrukh,
<lb/>Who sought in all the pleasure of the Shah,
<lb/>Went to him and thus spake: <q>The indications
<lb/>Detailed by that famed man before the lords
<lb/>Can only, otherwise we clutch but wind,
<lb/>Apply, methinketh, to Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Son of Gashasp, a noble, well skilled horseman
<lb/>To whom thou gavest Ardabil and Barda
<pb n="8.100"/>
<lb/>Where he became marchlord with drums and troops.</q>
<lb/>The Shah dispatched a speedy cameleer
<lb/>To bid Bahram Chubina dally not
<lb/>Upon the way but come from Ardabil
<lb/>To court alone without the drums and host.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The messenger the joyful news conveyed,
<lb/>And told him what Mihran Sitad had said.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>How Bahram Chubina came to Hurmuzd and was made Captain of the Host</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1807"/>
<p>
<lb/>Not calling any of his warriors
<lb/>That world-aspirant hurried off from Barda,
<lb/>And when he came the Shah accorded audience.
<lb/>On seeing the visage of the king of kings
<lb/>The veteran much praised that noble one,
<lb/>Who at first sight grew favourably disposed,
<lb/>Perceived the marks named by Mihran Sitad
<lb/>In him, smiled and grew blithe of countenance,
<lb/>Received him well and lodged him splendidly.
<lb/>When sombre night flung off its musky veil,
<lb/>And Sol displayed its face, the marchlord came
<lb/>To court, and all the chiefs made way for him.
<lb/>The world-lord summoned him and made him sit
<lb/>Among the magnates, told him how Iran
<lb/>Was placed and what Mihran Sitad had said,
<lb/>Then asked about king Sawa, saying: <q>Shall I
<lb/>Make peace or send forth troops ? </q>
<lb/>The warrior
<lb/>Replied: <q>We may not make a peace with him,
<lb/>For, since he fain would fight, to sue for peace
<pb n="8.101"/>
<lb/>Will mean defeat for us; the foe moreover
<lb/>Will be emboldened if he see thee weak.
<lb/>To proffer feast in war-time is to make
<lb/>Contention like submission.</q>
<lb/>Said Hurmuzd:—
<lb/><q>What is the course then? Shall I seek delay,
<lb/>Or march to battle?</q>
<lb/>He made answer thus:—
<lb/><q>It augureth well if<note>Reading with P.</note> foes behave unjustly.
<lb/>What said the noble counsellor? <q>No match
<lb/>For justice is injustice.</q> Therefore seek
<lb/>To fight with this injurious enemy,
<lb/>For fire and water will not flow together;<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>But if thou actest otherwise herein
<lb/>The ancient sky will choose another Shah.
<lb/>If we put forth the might of our own arms,
<lb/>And what we have of prowess, holy God
<lb/>Will neither blame us nor shall we be shamed
<lb/>Before the heroes when the truth is sought.
<lb/>Shall we be weak enough to shun the combat
<lb/>While yet ten thousand of Iranians
<lb/>Remain unslain? What will malignants say
<lb/>To thee if thou flee foes without a fight?
<milestone unit="calced" n="1808"/>
<lb/>When I pour arrows down on them and make
<lb/>My bow as ’twere a cloud in Spring, and when
<lb/>A hundred thousand swords and iron maces
<lb/>Are brandished in the ranks of war, and yet
<lb/>We gain no glimpse of triumph but despair
<lb/>Of fortune in our hearts, then we will be
<lb/>Our foemen’s to command for we shall have
<lb/>No body, life or spirit, left to us;
<lb/>But let us struggle till we see if heaven
<lb/>Will bring us gain or loss.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>The Shah smiled and the court grew bright, and then
<pb n="8.102"/>
<lb/>The veterans left the presence with full hearts,
<lb/>And talking with Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>Henceforth if he shall speak with thee be modest,
<lb/>Because king Sawa hath such mighty powers
<lb/>That e’en to ants and gnats they bar the way!
<lb/>Who after what thou said’st before the Shah
<lb/>Will venture to be captain of the host?</q>
<lb/>He answered them: <q>Illustrious warriors!
<lb/>I will be captain by our great Shah’s leave.</q>
<lb/>Informants on the watch went to the world’s king,
<lb/>And told him of this speech and ten times more.
<lb/>The king of kings rejoiced thereat and ceased
<lb/>To fear those troops. He gave Bahram Chubina
<lb/>The chief command, exalting to the clouds
<lb/>His valiant head. All warriors that sought
<lb/>For glory hailed him captain of the host.
<lb/>He came before the king with girded loins,
<lb/>Equipped for war, and said: <q>By thy permission
<lb/>I will call o’er the roll and ascertain
<lb/>Who are the fighting-men and who are slack
<lb/>In quest of fame.</q>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Thou art leader
<lb/>Responsible for good and ill alike.</q>
<lb/>The chief went to the royal muster-ground,
<lb/>And bade the troops parade. He made his choice
<lb/>Of those that were the crown among the chiefs,
<lb/>And entered on the roll twelve thousand names
<lb/>Of mail-clad warriors on barded steeds.
<lb/>All those enrolled were forty years of age;
<lb/>The older and the younger were rejected.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina held the chief command
<lb/>As one renowned in war. He made one hight
<lb/>Yalan-sina—a man of vengeful breast—<note>Sina.</note>
<lb/>Chief of the warrior-chiefs to go before
<pb n="8.103"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1809"/>
<lb/>The ranks on battle-days, to wheel his steed,
<lb/>Proclaim his ancestry, and set on strife
<lb/>The warriors’ thoughts. One named Izid Gashasp,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Who drew not rein at fire, he bade to guard
<lb/>The baggage-train and dress the wings. He made
<lb/>Kanda Gashasp, who as he rode would grasp
<lb/>The tails of lions, leader of the rear.
<lb/>Then to the troops thus spake the paladin:—
<lb/><q>Ye ardent chiefs! if ye would have God’s help
<lb/>In lightening your dark task inflict not harm
<lb/>Or loss and never gird your loins for ill,
<lb/>And when at night the clarion-call ariseth
<lb/>Leap up and one and all so spur your steeds
<lb/>That in the dark more tumult may arise.
<lb/>Through strength derived from resting horse and man
<lb/>Will take no thought about the day of battle.</q><note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>When tidings reached the king of how the wise
<lb/>Bahram Chubina acted he rejoiced
<lb/>Both at the words and deeds; he oped his treasures,
<lb/>And paid the troops. He gave Bahram withal
<lb/>Arms from the magazines which he unlocked,
<lb/>Assembled in the city all the herds
<lb/>Of battle-steeds that were at large, and ordered
<lb/>The captain of the host to ask of him
<lb/>Whate’er was needful, saying: <q>Thou hast seen
<lb/>All sorts of warfare and hast heard what stores
<lb/>King Sawa, that illustrious man, possesseth
<lb/>Of treasure, arms, and troops, and how his Turks
<lb/>Set earth a-quaking on the day of battle.
<lb/>Now thou hast chosen out of all the host
<lb/>Twelve thousand men in mail on barded steeds!
<lb/>I know not how such numbers can avail
<lb/>Upon the day of fight, and thou hast chosen,
<lb/>Instead of youthful sworders, men of forty!</q>
<pb n="8.104"/>
<lb/>The chief replied: <q>Well-starred and courteous Shah!
<lb/>The saying of the mighty thou hast heard,
<lb/>Who ruled the world as Shahs in days of old:—
<lb/><q>When conquering fortune is assisting thee
<lb/>Tis well though little other aid there be,</q>
<lb/>And by this token I will prove it too
<lb/>If now the Shah, whose word is law, will hear:
<lb/>When Kai Kaus was in Hamavaran,
<lb/>In bonds with countless others, Rustam chose
<lb/>Twelve thousand fit and warlike cavaliers,
<lb/>And freed him, and no harm befell the chiefs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1810"/>
<lb/>Again, Gudarz, son of Kishwad, the head
<lb/>Of noble and illustrious men, employed
<lb/>Twelve thousand men in mail on barded steeds
<lb/>To execute revenge for Siyawush.
<lb/>Again, the glorious Asfandiyar
<lb/>Was leader of twelve thousand warriors
<lb/>Against Arjasp and by a stratagem
<lb/>Made dust fly out of host and hold alike.<note>In the accounts given in the poem of these instances the limitation to twelve thousand is recorded only in the case of Asfandiyar. Later on, Gudarz, Bahram Chubina’s sister, repeats the statement about Rustam. See p. 108.</note>
<lb/>When any host exceedeth this amount
<lb/>It is too large for dash and enterprise;
<lb/>The leader that conducteth countless troops
<lb/>To battle is discomfited in fight.

<lb/>As for thy saying: <q>Men of forty years
<lb/>Are not so eager for the fight as youths,</q>
<lb/>The man of forty hath experience,
<lb/>And excellence in point of hardihood,
<lb/>Remembering the seal of bread and salt
<lb/>O’er which the heaven hath so oft revolved.
<lb/>In dread too of the voice of calumny,
<lb/>And loss of fame, he shirketh not the fight.
<lb/>Moreover wife and child and family
<pb n="8.105"/>
<lb/>Irk not the feelings of a veteran.
<lb/>A young man is deceived by outward show,
<lb/>And when he should have patience he is rash.
<lb/>He hath not wife or child or tilth; to him
<lb/>The worthy and the worthless seem alike.
<lb/>Since wisdom resteth on experience
<lb/>He seeth not the import of affairs.
<lb/>If he is conqueror in any fight
<lb/>He laugheth with delight and wasteth time;
<lb/>But if one chanceth to prevail against him
<lb/>His foes see nothing but his back.</q>
<lb/>On hearing,
<lb/>The king grew fresh as roses in the Spring,
<lb/>Then said: <q>Depart, put on thy mail, and go
<lb/>Forth from the palace to the riding-ground.</q>
<lb/>The general left the king, called for his girdle,
<lb/>Mail-coat, and Ruman helm, had his steed barded,
<lb/>And set the coiled up lasso in its straps.
<lb/>The world-lord with his arrows, clubs, and balls
<lb/>Went out upon the ground with his wazirs.
<lb/>The general approached with mace and mail
<lb/>And Ruman casque. The world-lord, seeing, blessed him.
<lb/>He kissed the ground and showed a liege’s prowess
<lb/>With mace, at polo, and in archery.
<lb/>The king then had the banner brought that bare
<lb/>A violet dragon for device, the banner
<lb/>That had been borne in fight in front of Rustam,<note>Cf. Vol. il. p. 154.</note>
<lb/>Grasped it immediately and, handling it
<lb/>With smiles, bestowed it on Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Invoking many a blessing on him, saying:—
<lb/><q>My predecessors used to hail as chief
<milestone unit="calced" n="1811"/>
<lb/>Of all our race the man whose name was Rustam,
<lb/>The paladin, the conqueror of the world,
<lb/>Triumphant and of ardent soul. Thou holdest
<pb n="8.106"/>
<lb/>His flag. Mayst thou be conquering and loyal <note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Thou art a second Rustam to my thoughts
<lb/>In courage, prowess, and obedience.</q>
<lb/>The paladin saluted him and said:—
<lb/><q>Be always conquering and bright of mind.</q>
<lb/>With peerless Rustam’s banner in his hand
<lb/>The general left the plain for his abode,
<lb/>And on their several ways the Shah’s troops went.
<lb/>The captain of the host was well content.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><head>How Bahram Chubina went with twelve thousand Cavaliers to fight King Sawa</head>
<p>
<lb/>When morning dawned upon the mountain-tops,
<lb/>And when the glittering Shield of Gold appeared,
<lb/>The chief came to the palace of the Shah,
<lb/>And prostrate in the presence of the troops
<lb/>Spake thus: <q>I was a man that had no claims,
<lb/>But by thy Grace became the age’s crown.
<lb/>I have to beg one favour of the king—
<lb/>That he will send with me a trusty man
<lb/>To make a note of those that fight and lay
<lb/>A hostile head beneath the dust and thus
<lb/>Achieve their end.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuzd replied: <q>Mihran,
<lb/>The old, is great, observant, eloquent,</q>
<lb/>Bade him accompany the chief and quit
<lb/>The palace for the combat. From the province
<lb/>Of Taisafun the army marched, their leader
<lb/>Bahram Chubina. ’Twas a prudent, brave,
<lb/>And dauntless host, and wary as a lion
<pb n="8.107"/>
<lb/>Was their commander. When he had departed
<lb/>The monarch of the world himself withdrew,
<lb/>Was privy with his archimage<note>Ayin Gashasp.</note> and said:—
<lb/><q>Upon the day of fight this man will laugh
<lb/>For joy! What will result? Let us confer.</q>
<lb/>The archimage answered: <q>Mayst thou live for ever,
<lb/>For thou deservest everlasting life.
<lb/>This paladin possessed of such a mien
<lb/>And stature, ready speech and ardent soul,
<lb/>Must needs be happy and victorious,
<lb/>And cause a barren world to bring forth fruit;
<lb/>But yet I fear me that he will revolt
<lb/>At last against his sovereign and patron
<lb/>Because he talked with such audacity,
<lb/>And spake so like a lion to the Shah.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1812"/>
<lb/>Hurmuzd made answer to him: <q>Mingle not
<lb/>Bane with the antidote, misdoubting one!
<lb/>If he shall prove victorious o’er king Sawa
<lb/>I ought to yield to him the crown and throne.
<lb/>May he be ever as now for he will make
<lb/>A glorious sovereign!</q>
<lb/>The archimage,
<lb/>On hearing what the Shah said, paled and bit
<lb/>His lips. The king himself moreover kept
<lb/>The thing in mind, and in a while selected
<lb/>A courtier as his confidant to learn
<lb/>How matters stood, and said: <q>Pursue in haste
<lb/>The paladin and tell what thou observest.</q>
<lb/>The agent followed swiftly, known to none.
<lb/>He was a guide, in omens skilled, and used
<lb/>To utter his prognostics to the Shah.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, quitting Taisafun,
<lb/>Led on the host himself. In front appeared,
<lb/>And far from him, one that purveyed sheep’s heads,
<pb n="8.108"/>
<lb/>Which rose above a clean draped wicker tray.
<lb/>The chieftain urged his horse and, strange to tell!
<lb/>Pierced one head with his spear, rode off with it
<lb/>Aloft, then flung it where he would and drew
<lb/>An omen from the matter, saying thus:—
<lb/><q>Just so will I cut off king Sawa’s head,
<lb/>Will throw it in his army’s line of march,
<lb/>And shatter all his host.</q>
<lb/>The emissary,
<lb/>Sent by the Shah, drew too his presage, saying:—
<lb/><q>This favourite of fortune will attain,
<lb/>His labours done, the crown at last for when
<lb/>His end is gained he will grow troublesome,
<lb/>And will rebel.</q>
<lb/>He went and told the king,
<lb/>Who wedded grief and anguish for the words
<lb/>Were worse than death to him. He withered up,
<lb/>That verdant leaf grew sere. He called to him
<lb/>A young man of the court and sent him off
<lb/>In all haste to the paladin and said:—
<lb/><q>Depart and tell the captain of the host:—
<lb/><q>For this night tarry where thou art. At dawn
<lb/>Turn back and come to me for I would clear
<lb/>The court of strangers and advise thee further,
<lb/>For thoughts of profit have occurred to me.</q></q>
<lb/>The messenger came to the paladin,
<lb/>And told what he had heard. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Made this reply: <q>Men do not, O wise Shah!
<lb/>Recall an army on the march; such action
<lb/>Would be ill-omened and would reinforce
<milestone unit="calced" n="1813"/>
<lb/>The foe. I will return when I have conquered,
<lb/>And then thy kingdom and thy diadem
<lb/>Shall shine.</q>
<lb/>The messenger returned and gave
<lb/>The warrior’s answer to the Shah and he
<lb/>Was satisfied. That envoy’s toil was vain.
<pb n="8.109"/>
<lb/>At dawn the captain of the host led on
<lb/>The troops and called God’s blessing down on them.
<lb/>He marched to Khuzistan: <note>This seems to imply that he started from Pars. Later on he says (p. 112) that he started from Baghdad, i.e., from the neighbourhood of Taisafun (Ctesiphon) where the troops were stationed (p. 90). Baghdad itself was not then in existence.</note> the troops harmed none.
<lb/>There came a woman with a sack of hay
<lb/>Among them and a horseman purchased it,
<lb/>Refused to pay her, and made off. She came
<lb/>Lamenting to Bahram Chubina, saying:—
<lb/><q>I have some hay concealed. I brought a sack’s worth,
<lb/>And passed before thy troops. A cavalier,
<lb/>With iron helm, hath taken it from me
<lb/>While on the march!</q>
<lb/>Forthwith they sought the man,
<lb/>And haled him quickly to the general.
<lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina said to him:—
<lb/><q>So thou didst think this fault a little one!</q>
<lb/>They smashed his head and hands and feet. The chief
<lb/>Had him dragged forth before the camp-enclosure,
<lb/>Then clave him through the middle with the sword,
<lb/>And filled the heart of the unjust with terror.
<lb/>Then from the camp-enclosure ’twas proclaimed:—
<lb/><q>O ye illustrious men and of good will!
<lb/>The stealer of a stalk of hay shall find
<lb/>No intercessor. I will cleave his waist
<lb/>Asunder with the sword. Let all procure
<lb/>By payment what they need.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Led on his host well ordered and they marched
<lb/>Toward Damaghan.
<lb/>The Shah was full of care
<pb n="8.110"/>
<lb/>At Sawa’s army, elephants, and treasures,<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>And spake thus to Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>One night at rise of moon: <q>Prepare to go
<lb/>To our opponent and be diligent,
<lb/>Not slumbering but speeding. Mark his troops
<lb/>As to their numbers and their quality,
<lb/>And who their leader and their warriors are.</q>
<lb/>He ordered that a letter of advice
<lb/>Should be indited to the hostile king,
<lb/>And countless royal presents sent therewith.
<lb/>He said thus to the messenger: <q>Proceed
<lb/>Toward Harat and if a host appear
<lb/>Know it for that of brave Bahram Chubina,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1814"/>
<lb/>And not another. Then approach and tell him
<lb/>What thou hast heard from me, thus saying: <q>I
<lb/>By good news and by blandishment will spread
<lb/>A fresh snare for the foe. Thy secret purpose
<lb/>Must be kept hidden. If he hear thy name
<lb/>And fame...! I will induce him to thy net,
<lb/>Employing fair and lengthy parleyings.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, prepared to start,
<lb/>Came as the Shah had bidden and delivered
<lb/>The message when he saw Bahram Chubina.
<lb/>He went thence to king Sawa, to the place
<lb/>Where were the elephants and troops and treasure,
<lb/>And, having audience, did him reverence,
<lb/>Delivering the message privily,
<lb/>And adding to it every argument
<lb/>To draw the army to Harat. When Sawa
<lb/>Arrived and camped upon the river-bank
<lb/>The outposts went forth, marked Bahram Chubina
<lb/>With all his troops and, seeing that stout host,
<lb/>Returned in all haste to king Sawa, saying:—
<lb/><q>A force hath reached the desert of Harat,
<lb/>Commanded by a famous chief.</q>
<pb n="8.111"/>
<lb/>King Sawa,
<lb/>Concerned what course to take, called from the tent
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah and rated him:—
<lb/><q>Didst not foresee, thou crafty Ahriman!
<lb/>A fall from thy high station? From the court
<lb/>Of that vile Shah thou camest to ensnare me,
<lb/>And leadest forth to war a Persian host,
<lb/>Encamping on the meadows of Harat!</q>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, replied: <q>The force
<lb/>Confronting thine is small. Take not its coming
<lb/>In ill part; ’tis some marchlord passing by,
<lb/>Or some chief seeking shelter with the Shah,
<lb/>Or merchants who have brought an escort with them,
<lb/>To guard them on their way. Who would confront thee,
<lb/>Though mountains turn to seas, to seek revenge?
<lb/>I will send one to find out who or what
<lb/>This traveller is.</q><note>This couplet inserted from P.</note>
<lb/>His words rejoiced king Sawa,
<lb/>Who said: <q>In truth that is the course to take.
<lb/>We will dispatch to learn if friend or foe
<lb/>They be.</q>
<lb/>Now as Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Withdrew to his own tent the night o’ertopped
<lb/>The mountains, and he got in readiness
<lb/>To flee the wrath to come. At dead of night
<lb/>The monarch bade Faghfur go with an escort
<milestone unit="calced" n="1815"/>
<lb/>Forth from his father to the paladin.
<lb/>That understanding youth went forth and reaching
<lb/>The Iranian host dispatched a cavalier
<lb/>To ask: <q>Who are these warriors and wherefore
<lb/>March they?</q>
<lb/>The horseman went like dust and cried:—
<lb/><q>Who are your chiefs and leader, noble sirs!
<pb n="8.112"/>
<lb/>And champion in the combat, for Faghfur,
<lb/>Who is king Sawa’s heart and eyes, would see him
<lb/>Without attendance?</q>
<lb/>Came a warrior
<lb/>Forth from the troops and told Bahram Chubina
<lb/>What he had heard. The captain of the host
<lb/>Went from the tent-enclosure and his flag
<lb/>Was reared resplendent over him. Faghfur
<lb/>Of Chin, perceiving, hasted and made sweat
<lb/>His prancing steed, and questioned: <q>Whence art thou?
<lb/>Why haltest here? I hear that thou hast fled
<lb/>From Pars as one who being wronged shed blood.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina answered: <q>God forbid
<lb/>That I should purpose vengeance on the Shah.
<lb/>I came forth from Baghdad with this array
<lb/>To fight by his command, for when the news
<lb/>About king Sawa and his host reached court
<lb/>He said to me: <q>Go forth and hold the road
<lb/>With arrows, maces, spears, and scimitars.</q></q>
<lb/>On hearing this Faghfur sped back to tell
<lb/>His sire how matters stood. Being thus apprised,
<lb/>And grown suspicious, Sawa sought forthwith
<lb/>The envoy of the Shah but someone said:—
<lb/><q>Kharrad, son of Barzin, hath fled with tears
<lb/>Of blood at having come.</q>
<lb/><q>How could that foe,</q>
<lb/>Said Sawa to his son, <q>get clear away
<lb/>At night from such a countless host as this,
<lb/>And wherefore have the guards been so remiss?</q>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><head>How King Sawa sent a Message to Bahram Chubina and his Answer</head>
<pb n="8.113"/>
<p>
<lb/>He sent thereafter to Bahram Chubina
<lb/>A fluent elder, saying: <q>Go and tell
<lb/>This Persian: <q>Mar not out of foolishness
<lb/>Thy reputation here, for surely thou
<lb/>Must know this much—that that great king of thine
<lb/>Would have thy life and therefore sendeth thee
<lb/>To fight with one nigh peerless in the world.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1816"/>
<lb/>He said to thee: <q>Go forth and seize their road,</q>
<lb/>And thou unwillingly didst hear the words,
<lb/>For with my troops and elephants I trample
<lb/>A mountain if it cometh in my path.</q></q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing what he said,
<lb/>Smiled at that hasty trafficking and answered:—
<lb/><q>If my death be the world-lord’s hidden purpose
<lb/>My duty is to do what pleaseth him
<lb/>Though earth shall take the measure of my height.</q>
<lb/>The messenger, returning to king Sawa,
<lb/>Reported what he heard the warrior say,
<lb/>And Sawa said: <q>Go, tell the Persian thus:—
<lb/><q>Why talk so much? Why art thou in the field?
<lb/>Ask what thou wilt of me.</q></q>
<lb/>The messenger
<lb/>Went to Bahram Chubina and thus spake:—
<lb/><q>Reveal thy purposes because my king
<lb/>Is favoured by the stars and he would have
<lb/>Thee do his will.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>Say: <q>If thou wouldst do right act openly.
<lb/>If friendship with the monarch of the world
<lb/>Be secretly thy wish I will receive thee
<pb n="8.114"/>
<lb/>On this march as a guest and pledge myself
<lb/>To grant thee thy desires. I will bestow
<lb/>On thy troops gold and silver, crowns and girdles
<lb/>Upon those worthy of them. I will send
<lb/>The Shah a cavalier that he may come
<lb/>Half way to meet thee and, as equals do,
<lb/>Provide thee provand. If thou art a friend
<lb/>He will make much of thee, but if thou hast
<lb/>Come hither for contention, to the deep,
<lb/>And to the crocodile’s maw, then thou shalt quit
<lb/>The desert of Harat in such a plight
<lb/>That all chiefs shall bewail thee. May a ditch
<lb/>Be at thy door on thy return, may blast
<lb/>Pursue and rain companion thee, for naught
<lb/>But ill luck brought thee hither, being fain
<lb/>That ill befall thy head.</q></q>
<lb/>The messenger
<lb/>Turned back, came like the wind, and gave the answer
<lb/>Of that aspirant. Hearing it king Sawa
<lb/>Was wroth with that stone-hearted opposite;
<lb/>His heart was straitened at that chill response,
<lb/>And thinking of it filled his cheeks with shame.
<lb/>He said: <q>‘Go, take yon human div this message:—
<lb/><q>Thou hast no fame in war; I would not slay thee.
<lb/>Such as thy Shah are servants at my court,
<lb/>And set by thee my meanest slaves are chiefs.
<lb/>If thou shalt ask for quarter at my hands
<lb/>I will exalt thy head above the throng,
<lb/>Thou shalt have many gifts from me, and all
<lb/>Thy troops shall be enriched; but one aspiring
<milestone unit="calced" n="1817"/>
<lb/>To valour looketh not to futile words
<lb/>And deeds of madness.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That proud monarch’s envoy
<lb/>Came to Bahram Chubina and delivered
<lb/>Those biting words which yet were what he wished.
<pb n="8.115"/>
<lb/>On hearing he informed the man: <q>Thy lord
<lb/>Must hear my answer: <q>If I am so mean
<lb/>That meanness covereth my head with shame,
<lb/>The king of kings for his part was ashamed
<lb/>To come out in his wrath to fight with thee.
<lb/>Tis through my meanness that I have marched forth
<lb/>With troops to wreck the kindred of king Sawa.
<lb/>I will cut off his head and carry it
<lb/>Before the Shah; it is not worth my while
<lb/>To stick it on my spear upon the road.
<lb/>For me to grant thee quarter would demean thee,
<lb/>But I will fall upon thee in my meanness.
<lb/>Thou shalt not see me save upon the day
<lb/>Of fight and followed by my dark-blue flag,
<lb/>Because if thou upon that dragon glance
<lb/>Tis death; thy head and helm shall sheath my lance.</q></q>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><head>How King Sawa and Bahram Chubina set the Battle in Array against each other</head>
<p>
<lb/>King Sawa’s envoy, when he heard those words
<lb/>Of stern defiance, showed his back. He went,
<lb/>And told what he had heard and seen whereat
<lb/>The Turks’ king’s head breathed vengeance and he bade
<lb/>To bring the tymbals forth and to lead out
<lb/>The elephants high-crested to the plain.
<lb/>The realm was darkened with the dust of hoofs,
<lb/>The trumpets blared. Now when Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Heard that a host had come, and plains and vales
<lb/>Were yellow, red, and black, he bade his men
<pb n="8.116"/>
<lb/>Mount and rode forth in armour, mace in hand.
<lb/>Behind him lay Harat, before a host
<lb/>Of swordsmen. He drew up the wings. The troops
<lb/>Were as one heart and body. Thou hadst said:—
<lb/><q>The world is all cuirass; a star is shining
<lb/>On every spear.</q>
<lb/>King Sawa viewed that field,
<lb/>Its order and array, perceived that while
<lb/>Bahram Chubina rested on Harat
<lb/>His own position was both cramped and ill,
<lb/>And thus addressed his horsemen, veterans,
<lb/>And intimates: <q>A lying messenger
<lb/>Came from the Persian leader of the folk,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1818"/>
<lb/>And tarried till yon host had seized the city,
<lb/>And left me nothing but a brake of thorns!</q>
<lb/>He ranked his army in that straitened place,
<lb/>The air was indigo and earth was hidden.
<lb/>Upon the right were two score thousand horsemen,
<lb/>Who used two-headed darts and wielded spears,
<lb/>With two score thousand on the left withal,
<lb/>All archers and engrossers of the fray,
<lb/>While two score thousand warriors formed the centre,
<lb/>Who carried spear or sword, and two score thousand
<lb/>He stationed in the rear; but many troops
<lb/>Were left unused for he was cramped for room.
<lb/>They placed the elephants before the line,
<lb/>As ’twere a wall, and barred the way in front.
<lb/>Thus circumstanced king Sawa’s heart was grieved
<lb/>By reason of this straitening of his host.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>His fortune hath foreshown
<lb/>To him the presage of an empty throne.</q>
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><head>How King Sawa sent another Message to Bahram Chubina and his Answer</head>
<pb n="8.117"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then from the champaign of Harat he sent
<lb/>Again a warrior of eloquence,
<lb/>A man all guileful, to Bahram Chubina
<lb/>To say: <q>Thou hast not wedded heaven’s own fortune:
<lb/>Wilt thou not hear advice and such appeals?
<lb/>Make friends with wisdom, open thine heart’s eyes.
<lb/>Thou hast found two whose equals in the world
<lb/>- Have never yet been born of royal race;
<lb/>They shine like suns in heaven and all the year
<lb/>Are clad in mail, they are so valorous.
<lb/>One is myself, the lawful king of earth;
<lb/>The other is my high-born son Parmuda.
<lb/>My troops are more than leaves upon the trees,
<lb/>Had some the skill to number them. If I
<lb/>Should reckon up my men and elephants
<lb/>Thou wouldest smile at rain-drops from Spring-clouds.
<lb/>There are tents, tent-enclosures, implements
<lb/>Of war beyond conception; shouldst thou count
<lb/>Withal my steeds and men, my wastes and mountains,
<lb/>Thou wouldest marvel. All the other kings,
<lb/>If worthy of such honour, are my lieges.
<lb/>If seas had life<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Si eau de la mer inondait Ja terre.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note> and mountains feet to run
<lb/>They could not carry off my treasury,
<lb/>Arms, implements, and fruitage of my toils.
<lb/>The glorious Great, save for thy Persian lord,
<lb/>Throughout the world acclaim me as their king,
<lb/>And thy life also lieth in my hands
<milestone unit="calced" n="1819"/>
<lb/>As well I know. If I lead on my troops
<pb n="8.118"/>
<lb/>They will not let pass ant and gnat. Withal
<lb/>I have a thousand barded elephants
<lb/>Whose scent affrayeth horsemen. Who will come
<lb/>To face me from Iran and from Turan,
<lb/>And by such coming aggravate my toils?
<lb/>From this place to the gates of Taisafun.
<lb/>My powers extend, will stay, be amplified.
<lb/>Some one hath duped thee, O mine enemy!
<lb/>Some one, perchance a madman, for thou lov’st not
<lb/>Thyself or else dissemblest since thine eye
<lb/>Discriminateth not ’twixt good and ill.
<lb/>How should such foolishness become the wise?
<lb/>Cease this contention and present thyself
<lb/>Before me, and I will not keep thee waiting,
<lb/>But give to thee high office and my daughter
<lb/>With worship and a crown. Thou shalt receive
<lb/>A lordship at our hands and suffer not
<lb/>The ills that subjects bear, and when the Shah
<lb/>Shall have been slain in fight, and when his crown
<lb/>And throne are mine, on thee will I bestow them
<lb/>With all his treasure, diadem, and goods.
<lb/>Thence will I march on Rum and then the troops,
<lb/>The treasure and the land, will all be thine.
<lb/>Thus have I spoken for thou pleasest me,
<lb/>And wisely hast thou dealt with these affairs.
<lb/>Thou knowest the conduct and the art of war;
<lb/>Thy sire and grandsire held command in chief,
<lb/>So what I say is not mere compliment
<lb/>But pity for thy sake who hast arrayed
<lb/>Thy puny force to fight with me to-day.
<lb/>Thou shalt receive no further messages
<lb/>If thou art retrograde to my desires.</q>
<pb n="8.119"/>
<lb/>The envoy spake, the chieftain heard and made
<lb/>A grim response: <q>O man of evil mark!
<lb/>Among the magnates and the eminent
<lb/>None reverenceth a monarch profitless
<pb n="8.120"/>
<lb/>And wordy. From thy talk from first to last
<lb/>I have perceived thee confident in speech.
<lb/>The man whose day is ending seeketh prowess
<lb/>In words not deeds. I heard thy feckless parle,
<lb/>Yet my heart quaileth not for fear of harm.
<lb/>As for thy saying: <q>I will slay the Shah,
<lb/>And give thee realm and throne,</q> a chief once said:—
<lb/><q>If thou shalt drive a mendicant away
<lb/>From any town is he not sure to say:—
<lb/><q>There I was lord; the rest were neath my sway?</q></q>
<lb/>In our affair there will not intervene
<lb/>Two days of sunlight ere I shall dispatch
<milestone unit="calced" n="1820"/>
<lb/>By this same token to the Shah thy head
<lb/>Upon a spear. Again, for what thou saidest
<lb/>About thy daughter, treasure, troops, and realm,
<lb/>I should have thanked thee once and should have called thee
<lb/>A monarch of discernment thus to give,
<lb/>Without designs upon the Iranian throne,
<lb/>Thy daughter to me and with her dispatch
<lb/>A gorgeous throne and goods. Then thou hadst had
<lb/>Myself for friend within Iran, not fought
<lb/>Against its warriors; but now my lance
<lb/>Is at thine ear and with my sword will I
<lb/>Behead thee, and when thou hast gone thy pate,
<lb/>Thy crown and treasure, are mine, and mine withal
<lb/>Thy daughter and the fruit of thy past toils.
<lb/>Thou saidest further: <q>I have crowns and thrones
<lb/>With elephants and horsemen past compute.</q>
<lb/>A chief said, battling in the ranks of war:—
<lb/><q>The longer water is denied a hound
<lb/>The greater will his eagerness be found.</q>
<lb/>The divs seduced thy heart so that thou camest
<lb/>To fight the Shah and thou wilt writhe beneath
<lb/>God’s chastisement and for thine evil deeds.
<pb n="8.121"/>
<lb/>Again, thou sayest: <q>I have among my lieges
<lb/>Great men possessed of crowns and coronets,
<lb/>And all the cities of the world are mine.</q>
<lb/>The age herein is witness to thy words.
<lb/>To cities roads are open, lord and liege
<lb/>May tramp the marches, but if thou shalt knock
<lb/>Upon a city-gate thy kingship there
<lb/>Will prove a brake of thorns. As for thine offer
<lb/>To pardon me—a craven in thine eyes—
<lb/>Thou wilt forgive me not when thou hast seen
<lb/>My spear and shalt not have me as a liege.
<lb/>As for thy troops, desires, and policy,
<lb/>Thy mighty elephants and throne, what time
<lb/>I rank mine army I account them naught,
<lb/>And care no jot for all thy warriors.
<lb/>Though thou art king thou utterest such lies
<lb/>That thou wilt gain no glory in the world.
<lb/>For what thou saidest: <q>I approve of thee,
<lb/>And would select thee as my general,</q>
<lb/>What I approve, since reaching man’s estate,
<lb/>Is the approval of the king of kings.
<lb/>I have allowed the king three days and when
<lb/>The Glory of the Lustre of the world
<lb/>Shall show, the army in Iran shall see
<lb/>Thy head upon a spear before the Shah.</q>
<lb/>The messenger returned with cheeks like gall,
<lb/>And fruitful, youthful fortune waxen old.
<lb/>He told king Sawa what the answer was,
<lb/>And at his words the monarch’s visage loured.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1821"/>
<lb/>Said the Faghfur: <q>What feebleness is this?
<lb/>Yon little host should rather ask our tears.</q>
<lb/>Then to the entry of the camp-enclosure
<lb/>He went and bade bring forth the Indian bells,
<lb/>Gongs, mighty elephants, and kettledrums,
<lb/>And make heaven ebon-hued. While that famed youth
<lb/>Prepared to fight the haughty monarch mused;
<lb/>Then to his son: <q>Thou chosen of the troops!
<lb/>Refrain from fighting till to-morrow morn.</q>
<lb/>The troops withdrew on both sides and the watch
<lb/>Went from the tent-enclosures. In both hosts
<lb/>They kindled fires, and rumour filled all coasts.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><head>How Bahram Chubina had a Dream in the Night, how he gave Battle the next Morning, and how King Sawa was slain</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina was alone
<lb/>Within his tent he sent and<note>Reading with P.</note> called the Iranians,
<lb/>And with his troops took counsel for the fight
<lb/>Till dark, till Turk and Persian both reposed,
<lb/>And he that would might have the world for naught;
<lb/>But brave Bahram Chubina still mused war,
<lb/>While sleeping in his tent. That Lion dreamed
<lb/>That in the fight the Turks proved valorous,
<lb/>While his own troops were routed and himself,
<lb/>Debarred more strife, unsuccoured and afoot,
<lb/>Asked quarter of the heroes of the foe.
<lb/>He woke in grief, his noble head sore troubled,
<lb/>With pain and sorrow passed the hours of dark,
<lb/>Arrayed himself but told to none his dream.
<lb/>Just then arrived Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Who had escaped king Sawa, and spake thus:<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/><q>What confidence is this? Behold the snare
<lb/>Of Ahriman and give not to the winds Iranian lives but treat these nobles fairly;
<lb/>For valour’s sake take pity on thy life,
<lb/>For nevermore will such a task confront thee.</q>
<lb/><q>Thy city,</q> said Bahram Chubina, <q>yieldeth
<lb/>No valour save thy sample, for all there
<pb n="8.122"/>
<lb/>Sell fish from Summer-time<note>Tammuz</note> till snow-storms come.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1822"/>
<lb/>Thy work is net and pond; thou art no man
<lb/>For spear and mace and arrow. When the sun
<lb/>Shall rise o’er yon dark mountains I will show thee
<lb/>How kings and soldiers fight. Thou shalt behold
<lb/>Those elephants and troops of his and all
<lb/>His fair presentment prostrate in the dust.</q>
<lb/>When Sol arose from Leo, and the world
<lb/>Grew white as Ruman’s face, the trumpet sounded,
<lb/>The battle-cry went up, earth shook beneath
<lb/>The horses’ hoofs, Bahram Chubina ranged
<lb/>His host and mounting grasped a war-worn mace.
<lb/>They furnished for the right three thousand men,
<lb/>All-cavaliers mail-clad and veteran.
<lb/>He sent an equal number to the left,
<lb/>All valiant, vengeful horsemen. On the right
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, who rode through rivers, led,
<lb/>And on the left Kanda Gashasp who worshipped
<lb/>The glorious Azargashasp. Yalan-sina
<lb/>Supported them with troops as a reserve.
<lb/>Hamdan Gashasp was posted in the van,
<lb/>A man whose horse-shoes set the reeds ablaze.
<lb/>With each there were three thousand warriors,
<lb/>All fighting cavaliers with hearts of stone.
<lb/>It was proclaimed: <q>Ye chiefs with golden crowns!
<lb/>Whoe’er, though faced by lion or by pard,
<lb/>Shall flee the fight, by God! I will behead him,
<lb/>And burn his useless carcase in the fire.</q>
<lb/>On each side of the host there was a road
<lb/>Whereby he<note>Bahram Chubina</note> might retreat. On each he raised
<lb/>A bank ten cubits high. His own position
<lb/>Was at the centre, and to him there came
<lb/>The archscribe<note>Mihran. See p. 106.</note> of the king of kings and said:—
<lb/><q>This is beyond thy power and thus to mock
<lb/>At fortune cannot prosper. Of the troops
<pb n="8.123"/>
<lb/>Upon this field we are the one white hair,
<lb/>Note, on a sable ox! No soil or stream,
<lb/>Or hill is visible, so many are
<lb/>The swordsmen of Turan!</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Cried at him furiously: <q>Thou recreant wretch!
<lb/>Thy business is with inkstand and with paper:
<lb/>Who bade thee take the number of the host?</q>
<lb/>The scribe approached Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>And said: <q>Bahram Chubina and the Div
<lb/>Are mates!</q>
<lb/>Those scribes then sought a way to flee
<lb/>That they might not behold that day of doom.
<lb/>They feared both king of kings and arrow-rain,
<lb/>And bit their lips. On one side and afar
<lb/>From those Turanian horsemen they beheld
<lb/>A height precipitous and thither fared
<milestone unit="calced" n="1823"/>
<lb/>A-tremble, saying: <q>We must watch the host.</q>
<lb/>They gazed upon Bahram Chubina’s helm
<lb/>To see how he would fight when roused. That hero,
<lb/>When he had drawn his host up, left the field,
<lb/>And with loud outcries, prostrate in the dust
<lb/>Before his God, exclaimed: <q>O righteous Judge!
<lb/>If in thy sight this conflict is unjust,
<lb/>And thou preferrest Sawa to myself,
<lb/>Give my heart rest in battle and to Sawa
<lb/>His whole desire upon the Iranians;
<lb/>But if I undergo this toil for Thee,
<lb/>And risk my head in fight, make jubilant
<lb/>Me and my troops and by our combating
<lb/>The world all prosperous.</q>
<lb/>Still praying loudly
<lb/>He mounted with his ox-head mace in hand.<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>King Sawa thus addressed his host: <q>Begin
<lb/>Your incantations that the Iranians
<pb n="8.124"/>
<lb/>May quail in heart and eye, and no disaster
<lb/>Befall yourselves.</q>
<lb/>Then all the sorcerers
<lb/>Began their spells and hurled fire through the air.<note>Three couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>Rose blast and murky cloud whence arrows showered
<lb/>Upon the Iranians. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Exclaimed: <q>Chiefs, magnates of Iran, and heroes!
<lb/>Shut ye your eyes to all these magic arts,
<lb/>And come all wroth to fight, for this is naught
<lb/>But trick and sorcery, and they that use
<lb/>Such means demand our tears.</q>
<lb/>The Iranians shouted,
<lb/>And girt their loins for bloodshed, while king Sawa
<lb/>Surveyed the field, saw that the foe recoiled not
<lb/>At those black arts but came on all the more,
<lb/>Led by Bahram Chubina, and assailed,
<lb/>Like wolf a lamb, their left, brake it and charged,
<lb/>Like one bemused, Bahram Chubina’s centre,
<lb/>Who thence saw how his soldiers fled the foe,
<lb/>Came, with his spear unhorsed three warriors,
<lb/>And dashed them headlong to the ground, exclaiming:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1824"/>
<lb/><q>This is the way to fight, this is the mode,
<lb/>And how to do it! Are ye not ashamed
<lb/>Before the Lord of earth, the glorious chiefs,
<lb/>And nobles?</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.125"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then he made toward the right,
<lb/>As ’twere a lusty lion famishing,
<lb/>And broke the mighty force opposed to him,
<lb/>So that their leader’s banner disappeared.
<lb/>Thence he departed to his army’s centre,
<lb/>To where the leader was among the troops,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Perdition take it all!
<lb/>If this fight lasts the host will be dispersed!
<lb/>Look out in what direction to retreat.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They went and sought; there was not any way
<lb/>Because the proper road was mounded over.
<lb/>Then to that leader said Bahram Chubina:
<lb/><q>There is an iron wall in front of us,
<lb/>And only he that knoweth how to make
<lb/>A breach therein can gain the other side,
<lb/>Safeguard himself and carry to Iran,
<lb/>And to the monarch of the brave, his life.
<lb/>All put your whole heart in it, shield your heads,
<lb/>And ply your swords. If sleepless fortune helps us
<lb/>It will repay our toils with thrones and crowns.
<lb/>Let none despair of God or ye may see
<lb/>Your white day turn to gloom.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>King Sawa thus
<lb/>Harangued his chiefs: <q>Advance the elephants
<lb/>Before the host, attack in force, and make
<lb/>The world both dark and narrow to our foes.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina from afar beheld
<lb/>The elephants, was grieved, unsheathed his sword,
<lb/>And thus addressed his captains: <q>Warriors famed!
<lb/>String up your bows of Chach and helm ye all.
<lb/>Now by the life and head of this world’s king,
<lb/>The chosen of the lords and crown of chiefs,
<lb/>Let every one that hath artillery
<lb/>String up his bow perforce and let him fix
<lb/>His arrows, fashioned out of triple wood,
<lb/>Whose points are keen for blood, upon the trunks
<lb/>Of yonder elephants, then out with mace,
<lb/>On to the fight, and slay your enemies.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The chieftain strung his bow and set a casque
<lb/>Of steel upon his head. He made his bow
<lb/>As ’twere a cloud in Spring and showered arrows
<lb/>Before the host: the soldiers followed him.
<lb/>The stars were dimmed by pointed, feathered shafts.
<lb/>They pierced the elephants’ trunks, and dale and plain


<pb n="8.126"/>


<lb/>Grew like a pool of blood. The elephants
<lb/>Turned from the smart and fled the battlefield.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1825"/>
<lb/>Now when the elephants were smitten thus
<lb/>They trampled their own troops. The Iranian host
<lb/>Came on behind and earth grew like the Nile.
<lb/>All was confusion; many died; ill fortune
<lb/>Had all its will of them. There was a spot,
<lb/>A pleasant place, behind that stricken host
<lb/>Where, on a golden throne, fierce Sawa sat.
<lb/>He saw his army like an iron mountain
<lb/>In flight with heads all dust and souls all gloom,
<lb/>While from behind enormous elephants
<lb/>Beyond control were trampling down the troops.
<lb/>He wept for wherefore should his army flee?
<lb/>And mounting his bay Arab fled himself
<lb/>In dire dismay. Bahram Chubina came
<lb/>Pursuing like an elephant run mad,
<lb/>A lasso on his arm, a bow in hand,
<lb/>And shouted to his troops: <q>Illustrious men!
<lb/>Ill fate hath marked them out.<note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note> Rain swords on them,
<lb/>And quit you in the fight like cavaliers.</q>
<lb/>He reached the hill where erst king Sawa sat
<lb/>Crowned on a throne of gold, beheld him thence
<lb/>Upon his mighty lion of an Arab,
<lb/>And sped forth like a tiger o’er the waste.
<lb/>He chose an arrow with a glittering point,
<lb/>Plumed with four eagle’s feathers, took in hand
<lb/>His bow of Chach and laid the deer-hide thong
<lb/>Within his thumb-stall, straightened his left arm,
<lb/>And bent his right. The bow twanged as he loosed
<lb/>The shaft and pierced king Sawa’s spine, who came
<lb/>Down headlong to the dust; the ground beneath him
<lb/>Was soaked with blood. Of that great host the king
<lb/>Bediademed was gone, gone golden throne,


<pb n="8.127"/>


<lb/>And golden crown. :
<lb/>Such deeds the turning sky
<lb/>Doth, showing neither love nor enmity.
<lb/>Joy not in lofty throne and greatly fear,
<lb/>What time thou feel’st secure, disaster near.
<lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina came and dragged
<lb/>The corpse face downward wallowing in the dust,
<lb/>And severed that crowned head while none of all
<lb/>Its kindred came anear. When the Turks found
<lb/>Their king the corpse lay headless on the road.
<lb/>All wailed; cries filled the earth; the air resounded,
<lb/>And he that was the son of Sawa said:—
<lb/><q>This is God’s doing, for unsleeping fortune
<lb/>Is with Bahram Chubina.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1826"/>
<lb/>Multitudes
<lb/>Died in the strait defiles. The elephants
<lb/>Trod many under foot; not one in ten
<lb/>Of all that host escaped. They perished crushed
<lb/>Beneath the elephants or were beheaded
<lb/>Upon the battlefield, and when nine hours
<lb/>Of that ill day had gone the Iranians saw
<lb/>No enemy alive save prisoners bound,
<lb/>Their souls and bodies pierced with grief and shafts.
<lb/>The route was strewn with bards and helms whose heads
<lb/>Were suffocate therein,<note n="2"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">de casques qui n’avaient pas garanti ce jour-là les têtes contre la mort.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note> with Indian swords,
<lb/>With arrows and with bows dropped by the foe
<lb/>On all sides. Earth was like a sea of blood
<lb/>With slain, and everywhere were saddled steeds.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina went his rounds to learn
<lb/>Who had been slain upon the Iranian side;
<lb/>Then said he to Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
<lb/><q>Give me thine aid to-day and ascertain
<lb/>What slain Iranians it is ours to mourn.</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.128"/>

<p>
<lb/>He went through all the tents. One man of worship
<lb/>Was missing in the host—a chieftain named
<lb/>Bahram, who was the son of Sityawush,
<lb/>A valiant prince, a magnate of Iran,
<lb/>Descended from a captain of the host.
<lb/>Like one insane Kharrad went forth in quest
<lb/>Of traces of him, moving many a form
<lb/>Of slain and wounded men but found no sign.
<lb/>The captain of the host was grieved thereat,
<lb/>And cried: <q>Alas! thou prudent warrior!</q>
<lb/>Howbeit the man himself appeared anon,
<lb/>A key to that locked door, and with a Turk
<lb/>Red-haired, cat-eyed, and, as thou wouldst have said,
<lb/>With heart all wrung with rage. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Cried when he saw Bahram: <q>Ne’er be it thine
<lb/>To wed the dust!</q> then of that foul Turk asked:—
<lb/><q>O thou hell-visaged, banned from Paradise!
<lb/>What man art thou? What is thy name and birth,
<lb/>For she who bare thee will have cause to weep?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>A warlock I. I meddle not
<lb/>With manhood and with manliness but help
<lb/>My chief in battle when things reach a pass,
<lb/>And make him dream of what will hearten him.
<lb/>I gave thee that ill dream last night to bring
<lb/>Ill on thy head, but I must seek for means
<lb/>More potent<note n="3">Reading with P.</note> for my sorcery hath failed,
<lb/>Ill-fortune hath recoiled upon my head,
<lb/>And all my toil is wedded to the wind.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1827"/>
<lb/>If I get quarter from thee thou hast gained
<lb/>An all-accomplished friend.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Bahram Chubina mused, his heart was troubled,
<lb/>His visage wan. Anon he said: <q>This man
<lb/>Might prove of service in the stress of fight,</q>
</p>

<pb n="8.129"/>

<p>
<lb/>But said again: <q>What did king Sawa profit
<lb/>Through this dark-dealing warlock? All good things
<lb/>Descend from God on fortune’s favourites,</q>
<lb/>Then bade cut off his head and robbed of life
<lb/>His feckless form, which done Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Stood up and said: <q>O just and upright Judge!
<lb/>From Thee are greatness, victory, the glory,
<lb/>High place, the diadem of king of kings,
<lb/>Distress and joy. Blest is the warrior
<lb/>That followeth Thy way.</q>
<lb/>The archscribe came,
<lb/>And spake thus: <q>Valiant Faridun, Bahram,<note>Bahram Gur probably is meant.</note>
<lb/>And Nushirwan ne’er saw one like to thee,
<lb/>O lusty paladin! Possessed art thou
<lb/>Of lion’s courage, counsel, and device.
<lb/>May no calamity befall thy life.
<lb/>Through thee the cities of Iran all live,
<lb/>And all the paladins are but thy slaves.
<lb/>Through thee the exalted throne hath been exalted,
<lb/>And every liege escaped mishap. Thou art
<lb/>A chieftain and a chieftain’s son, and blest
<lb/>Is she that brought forth such a child, for thou
<lb/>Art glorious by birth and enterprise,
<lb/>A king all absolute in Grace and wisdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the Shah’s paladins and men of might
<lb/>Dispersed themselves and left the scene of fight.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>How Bahram Chibina sent a Letter announcing his

<pb n="8.130"/>
<lb/>Appeared, the world had respite from the drum.
<lb/>Meanwhile the wheel of heaven turned apace
<lb/>In view of darksome night and hurried on
<lb/>Till from the deep a Golden Vessel rose,
<lb/>And travail waxed and slumber faded away.
<lb/>Then came the captain of the host and sent
<lb/>Someone to bid his comrades good at need:—
<lb/><q>All those that have been slain among the chiefs,
<lb/>War-cavaliers and captains of the Turks,
<lb/>Each leader of the folk, behead and set
<milestone unit="calced" n="1828"/>
<lb/>Behind the heads of all of them that were
<lb/>Those warriors’ diadem a flaunting flag.</q>
<lb/>He had the captives and the heads collected,
<lb/>And carried from the field, then called a scribe
<lb/>And spake at large of that famed, countless host,
<lb/>The movements and the day’s vicissitudes,
<lb/>The battle and<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> the divers stratagems
<lb/>That he had used against so vast a foe,
<lb/>The toils and fighting of the Iranians,
<lb/>And how no horsemen loosed his belt all day.
<lb/>When he had written to the Shah he chose
<lb/>A courier from the troops, first put upon
<lb/>A lance the head of Sawa, then bade bear
<lb/>The standard of that monarch and the heads
<lb/>Of those chiefs of Turan and cavaliers
<lb/>Of Chin withal upon a dromedary
<lb/>With all speed to the Shah. The prisoners,
<lb/>And whatsoever spoil there was he kept
<lb/>Intact within Harat until the king
<lb/>Should make his pleasure known. He sent withal
<lb/>Experienced horsemen to escort the heads,
<lb/>And to obtain permission from the Shah
<lb/>To march against Parmuda with the host.
<lb/>The dromedary started, and a guide
<lb/>Led on the cavaliers who toiled and trod
<pb n="8.131"/>
<lb/>The way that quickly they might see the Shah,
<lb/>And greet him from the paladin and chiefs.
<lb/>Upon their side the Turks all destitute
<lb/>Went horseless, weaponless, and baggageless,
<lb/>And both their cavaliers and those of Chin
<lb/>Returned toward Turan. Now when the news
<lb/>Came to Parmuda he put off his crown,
<lb/>While from the Turks arose a grievous wail;
<lb/>The day was bitter for those chiefs; all heads
<lb/>Were full of dust, all eyes of tears, and none
<lb/>Ate or reposed or slumbered. Then he summoned
<lb/>The warriors and, weeping his heart’s blood,
<lb/>Inquired of them: <q>Why did that countless host
<lb/>Prove impotent upon the day of battle?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>A counsellor replied: <q>We held the foe
<lb/>To be but weak, but none will see in time
<lb/>Of action such another cavalier
<lb/>As brave Bahram Chubina. Not one man
<lb/>For every century of ours had he,
<lb/>Yet not a youth of his brave troops was wounded,
<lb/>For God directed him! I might say more,
<lb/>But thou hast heard enough.</q>
<lb/>On this Parmuda
<lb/>Reflected on Bahram Chubina’s deeds,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1829"/>
<lb/>Was wroth, turned pale of cheek, and was resolved
<lb/>In his distress of heart to battle on.
<lb/>A hundred thousand of the host remained—
<lb/>All men of name and ready for the fray.
<lb/>He led his army plain-ward from the camp
<lb/>Toward the Jihun in order to avenge
<lb/>His noble father on Bahram Chubina.
<lb/>What time the letter of that paladin
<lb/>Came to the Shah of ardent soul that world-lord
<lb/>Was sitting on his throne and holding forth
<lb/>Concerning his own fortune to the court:—
<lb/><q>Strange! that no tidings of Bahram Chubina
<pb n="8.132"/>
<lb/>Have reached our court! What say ye, and henceforth
<lb/>What shall we do? We must advise thereon.</q>
<lb/>Now as he spake the words the chamberlain
<lb/>Came from the gate and brought the king of kings
<lb/>The glad news: <q>May the Shah rejoice for ever!
<lb/>Bahram Chubina hath prevailed o’er Sawa,
<lb/>And grown the lustre of the world in fight.</q>
<lb/>At once the Shah called in the messenger
<lb/>Sent by Bahram Chubina, seating him
<lb/>Above the nobles present, and inquired
<lb/>Concerning host and paladin and those
<lb/>Illustrious and glorious warriors.
<lb/>The messenger replied: <q>Exalted Shah!
<lb/>The battle went as thou didst wish. Mayst thou
<lb/>Live ever happily and joyously,
<lb/>For thy foe’s fortune hath grown old. The heads
<lb/>Both of king Sawa and his younger son—
<lb/>Him whom his father used to call Faghfur—
<lb/>Are at thy gate on spears—a sight for all
<lb/>The city.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this, the king of kings
<lb/>Rose, quickly bowed, and standing in God’s presence
<lb/>Said: <q>O Thou righteous Guide! Thou hast destroyed
<lb/>Our foes, Thou Fashioner of sun and moon!
<lb/>Great was my wretchedness and my despair
<lb/>What time the foe came headlong from his throne!
<lb/>Twas neither chieftain nor the warrior-host
<lb/>That did this, but God’s goodness to His slave.</q>
<lb/>Then from the treasures that his sire had left
<lb/>He had a hundred thousand drachms brought forth,
<lb/>With one third first gave largess to the poor,
<lb/>But the more part to his own servitors,
<lb/>And sent the Fanes of Fire another third,
<lb/>There to be given over to the priests
<pb n="8.133"/>
<lb/>To grace the Feasts of New Year and of Sada.
<lb/>With what was left men sought out and repaired
<lb/>The ruined sites and caravansaries
<lb/>In desert places, rendering the roads
<milestone unit="calced" n="1830"/>
<lb/>Secure and easy. He remitted imposts
<lb/>For four years to the poor, and subject kings,
<lb/>And then had letters written to each province,
<lb/>To all the nobles, thus: <q>‘Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Hath triumphed o’er the foe and with his sword
<lb/>Cut off king Sawa’s head.</q>
<lb/>The Shah next passed
<lb/>Two weeks in prayer; then when the world’s light rose
<lb/>He called the envoy of the paladin,
<lb/>And seated him rejoicing ’mongst the lords;
<lb/>Then wrote an answer instantly and set
<lb/>A tree within the garth of majesty,
<lb/>Sent too a silver throne and golden boots,
<lb/>And wealth of all sorts. All that lay between
<lb/>Haital and the great river<note>The Oxus</note> he bestowed
<lb/>On that bold paladin<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> and bade: <q>‘Distribute
<lb/>Spoil ta’en on way and waste among the troops
<lb/>Except king Sawa’s private property;
<lb/>Let that be sent to court. This done, make war
<lb/>Upon Parmuda till he is o’erthrown.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuz sent gifts too to the Iranians,
<lb/>Confirmed by letters written to each city.
<lb/>They gave the messenger a robe of honour,
<lb/>And called thereafter for the nobles’ steeds.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, when the envoy came,
<lb/>Joyed well content and gave the troops much booty,
<lb/>Except the wealth pertaining to king Sawa,
<lb/>The impure of heart; this he dispatched with horsemen,
<lb/>Famed veterans of his kin, who bore it all
<pb n="8.134"/>
<lb/>To court what while the chieftain went his way,
<lb/>He and his army, to renew the fray.</p>

<lb/>Two leagues of plain lay suitable for fight.

<lb/>The next day brave Bahram Chubina went
<lb/>To view Parmiuda’s warriors. Parmuda

<lb/>That though their troops are few their horse are splendid,
<lb/>And in the chief degree of warriors,
<lb/>Well armed, and have for chief Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>A man to whom spears are as thorns and weeds,
<lb/>With heart elate at conquering king Sawa,
<lb/>And drunk with gore; yet by the Maker’s aid
<lb/>I will require from that huge Mountain-mass
<lb/>The vengeance owing for my father’s blood.</q>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina left Iran
<lb/>To fight the Turks a reader of the stars
<lb/>Said: <q>Stir not on the Wednesday of each week,
<lb/>Or harm will follow, and thy whole emprise
<lb/>Prove profitless.</q>
<lb/>Between the hosts there lay
<lb/>A garden bordered by the battlefield,
<lb/>And on the Wednesday of the week at dawn
<lb/>Bahram Chubina thither went and said:—
<lb/><q>We will be glad to-day.</q>
<lb/>They carried thither
<lb/>Rich carpetings; he took wine, meat, and minstrels,
<lb/>And coming to that garden revelled there.
<lb/>Now when a watch of darksome night had passed
<lb/>The outposts brought Parmiuda the report:—
<lb/><q>Bahram Chubina revelleth in the garden.</q>
<lb/>The chieftain chose among his warriors
<lb/>Six thousand cavaliers, all valiant men,
<lb/>And sent them forth without lights to surround
<lb/>The garth and take the Iranian chiefs. Now when
<lb/>Bahram Chubina was aware thereof,
<lb/>And of the plan and purpose of Parmida,
<lb/>He thus addressed Yalan-sina: <q>O chieftain!
<pb n="8.136"/>
<lb/>Break us a passage through the garden-wall.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina and Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>With other warriors, mounted on their steeds.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1832"/>
<lb/>They issued from the breach; who knoweth how
<lb/>Those warriors issued? At the garden-gate
<lb/>Arose the clarion-blare: the chieftain charged.
<lb/>They quickly made a second breach and smote
<lb/>The foe. Bahram Chubina, dart in hand,
<lb/>And half bemused, assailed them. Few escaped him,
<lb/>So eager was his drunken head for blood!
<lb/>As when smiths’ hammers meet the steel so rang
<lb/>The chieftains’ blows, and trunkless heads were strewn
<lb/>Between the garth and king Parmuda’s camp.
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina had returned
<lb/>To his own camp he planned a camisade,
<lb/>And, midnight past, girt up his loins and led
<lb/>His powers against the foe. Among the Turks
<lb/>There was no scout that saw him. When he reached
<lb/>His fighting-ground the blare of trumpets rose.
<lb/>Roused in the darkness by the clarions’ din
<lb/>The warrior Turks leaped up, and such a shout
<lb/>As would have split a mighty lion’s ears,
<lb/>Ascended.<note>Couplet omitted.</note> None knew who another was
<lb/>Amid the lengthy lances and the gloom.
<lb/>The Iranians made their swords flash fire and set
<lb/>The earth and air ablaze. Of those brave Turks
<lb/>But few were left; the stones were coralline
<lb/>With blood. Like flying dust the leader fled,
<lb/>Dry-mouthed and livid-lipped, and thus it was
<lb/>Till dawn began to breathe and sombre night
<lb/>Drew in its skirts, and then the Iranian chief
<lb/>O’ertook the foe and roaring like a lion
<lb/>Cried to Parmida: <q>O thou runaway!
<lb/>Mix not henceforth with warriors. Thou’rt no man
<pb n="8.137"/>
<lb/>Of battle but a very child: ’tis fit
<lb/>Thou suck thy mother’s milk.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The king replied:—
<lb/><q>How long, O ravening lion! wilt thou be
<lb/>Thus keen for bloodshed? Crocodiles in water,
<lb/>And pards on land, grow satiate with the blood
<lb/>Of heroes in the fight. Will naught sate thee?
<lb/>Methinketh that thou art a ravening lion,
<lb/>Thou who hast stricken off king Sawa’s head—
<lb/>A man beloved through life by circling heaven—
<lb/>And slaughtered so his troops that sun and moon
<lb/>Feel ruth for them, while as for me who am
<lb/>That valiant king’s memorial, know that thou
<lb/>Hast slain me too with sheer distress. We all
<milestone unit="calced" n="1833"/>
<lb/>Are mother-born for death and have surrendered
<lb/>Our necks thereto since remedy is none.<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>I flee; thou followest but wilt not take me
<lb/>Till my time come. If sword in hand I turn
<lb/>Upon thee either of us may be slain.
<lb/>Be not so hasty and so hot of head,
<lb/>For that becometh neither chief nor host.
<lb/>Now will I fare to mine own tent and there
<lb/>Seek to retrace my steps. I will indite
<lb/>A letter to the king in fashion such
<lb/>As fortune maketh needful, and if he
<lb/>Accept me and protect me from attack
<lb/>I will become a bondslave at his court,
<lb/>And wholly banish lordship from my heart.
<lb/>Put from thee war and strife. Thou camest to fight;
<lb/>Now feast in all good will.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>On hearing this, turned back, for that curst foe
<lb/>Had grown so gracious. When the troops had rested,
<pb n="8.138"/>
<lb/>And come to king Parmiuda’s camp, they fared
<lb/>About the field, cut off the chieftains’ heads,
<lb/>And heaped them till the pile grew mountain-like:
<lb/>The hero’s men of name called it Bahram Tal.<note>Tal is a heap or mound.</note>
<lb/>Whate’er they saw of horsemen’s equipage,
<lb/>And other booty, they assembled there.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina wrote the king a letter
<lb/>About Parmiuda and his countless host,
<lb/>Narrating <q>all that hath befallen us
<lb/>Both from the Turks and from their warlike king,
<lb/>Whose heart was eager to avenge his sire,
<lb/>And who departed to Awaza hence.</q>
<lb/>Parmida, on his side, made fast the hold,
<lb/>And sat down deep in thought, while in pursuit
<lb/>Came countless troops and circled it about;
<lb/>But though so many leaguered it none knew
<lb/>Parmida’s plans. Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>The toils of war are better than delay,</q>
<lb/>And so he told Yal-an-sina to choose
<lb/>Three thousand of the horsemen on the field,
<lb/>And further that Izid Gashasp should call
<lb/>To horse four thousand warriors of the troops.
<lb/>He bade behead forthwith all whom they found,
<lb/>Thus haply from the hold the king to draw
<lb/>When all the waste a-stream with blood he saw.</p>

<lb/>Bahram Chubina stayed before the hold
<lb/>Three days but sent at sun-rise on the fourth
 
    <pb n="8.139"/>
    
<lb/>This message to Parmiuda as the chief
<lb/>Both of the realm and race: <q>O noble king
<lb/>Of Chin and of the Turks! why hast thou chosen
<lb/>To occupy this stronghold ? Where are now
<lb/>King Sawa’s passion to possess the world,
<lb/>And all his treasure, power, and elephants,
<lb/>His armour for the steeds and ardent chiefs ?
<lb/>Where are thy witchcraft and thy sorcery
<lb/>That now thou dost seclude thyself ? Time was
<lb/>When all the Turks’domain was not enough
<lb/>For thee, thy father peerless in the world.
<lb/>Now womanlike thou sittest in this hold,
<lb/>With full heart, beating thine own head. Undo
<lb/>The castle-gate, seek quarter, ask of me
<lb/>To plead for thee before my king. Dispatch
<lb/>Thy treasures of dinars and all thy purses
<lb/>From this hold plain-ward or if thou keep them
<lb/>Keep not the realm for kings despise dinars.
<lb/>Myself will intercede for thee at court
<lb/>Because I am the champion of Iran ;
<lb/>Thee will I make chief of all chiefs and treat thee
<lb/>Above thine aims and thine imaginings.
<lb/>Now if thou hast some hidden policy,
<lb/>One that will make thy gloomy prospects bright,
<lb/>Confide in me; since thine affairs are thus
<lb/>Be not thou distant. I have given thee quarter,
<lb/>As thou dost know, and opened thee a way
<lb/>To seape by, else thou hadst been lifeless now,
<lb/>As is thy sire, and seen not son or kindred :
<lb/>But if thou hast companions for the fight,
<lb/>With treasure and abundance of dinars,
<lb/>Exert thyself herein and take revenge,
<lb/>For troops are not to seek where there is treasure.</q>
<lb/>The messenger arriving told his message,
<lb/>Which when Parmida, the ambitious, heard
<lb/>He answered: <q>Say: <q>If so thou canst forbear
    <pb n="8.140"/>
    
    
<lb/>To search out this world’s secrets. Thou perchance
<lb/>Hast made too bold therewith because thy toils
<lb/>Have brought forth fruit; yet in thy victory
<lb/>Joy not; though thou art young the world is old.
<lb/>The secret of the turning sky is known
<lb/>To none; it never showeth us its face.
<lb/>To mock becometh not a general.
<lb/>I too had soldiers, elephants, and drums,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1835"/>
<lb/>But heaven above is practised in deceit,
<lb/>So couple not thy heart with arrogance.
<lb/>My sire, the world-lord, that discerning man,
<lb/>Whom thou beheldest on the day of fight,
<lb/>Had earth as bondslave of his horse’s hoofs,
<lb/>And heaven revolved according to his will ;
<lb/>Yet sought he what it was not his to seek,
<lb/>And turned not from his wrongful purposes.
<lb/>His prowess is o'erlaid by ridicule,
<lb/>And enemies bemock him from afar.
<lb/>As for thy saying that thy host exceedeth
<lb/>The revolutions of the sun and moon
<lb/>In sum, and that thy steeds and elephants
<lb/>Seem grass-seeds scattered by a wind-mill’s sails,
<lb/>All that will pass away and thou withal
<lb/>Wilt cease to joy and to illume the world.
<lb/>Fear sharp fate’s vengeance yet ;<note n="1"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Crains le sort, qui séme la vengeance.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note> it may infuse
<lb/>Some of its bane in this thine antidote.


<lb/>When one hath made a trade of shedding blood,
<lb/>And harassing the hearts of enemies,
<lb/>Men will shed his blood also by the token
<lb/>That he hath shed the blood of other chiefs.
<lb/>Wreck though thou mayst the country of the Turks
<lb/>Still in the end they will exact revenge.
<lb/>If I shall come to thee forthwith I fear
<lb/>That thou wilt make an end of me. Thou art
<lb/>A slave; I am a king. Shall I abase me
<pb n="8.141"/>
<lb/>Before a thrall? I will not come to battle
<lb/>Without a host or those that wish me well
<lb/>Will call me mad; but it is no disgrace
<lb/>For me to ask for quarter from thy Shah
<lb/>In mine extremity. When that is done
<lb/>The hold, the treasure, and the men are thine;
<lb/>Thy wishes will be law in this famed land.</q></q>
<lb/>The messenger returned with this reply;

<lb/>He is beleaguered by Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And needeth a safe-conduct under seal;
<lb/>The news thereof will be a feast to him.
<lb/>Now since the suppliant is the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Fall’n from such dignity to wretchedness,
<lb/>The king of kings should pity one whose worship
<lb/>Hath passed away.</q>
<lb/>Now when the letter reached
<lb/>The Shah he cloudward raised his glorious crown.
<lb/>He sent and summoned the Iranians,
<lb/>And set them by the famous throne of kingship,

<lb/>Bade read the letter and strew gems upon

<pb n="8.142"/>
<lb/>Our crown. He raised his head to touch the sky,

<lb/>He called the envoy of the paladin,
<lb/>Gave him a long and gracious interview,
<lb/>Called for a girdle set with royal gems,
<lb/>A kingly robe of honour and a steed
<lb/>With trappings decked with gold and every buckle
<lb/>Bejewelled. To the messenger withal

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1837"/>
<lb/>Now when this letter reached the paladin
<lb/>That famous chieftain’s heart grew young; the letter
<lb/>Astounded him. He sent and called the Iranians,
<lb/>And showed the Shah’s gifts; all that saw them blessed him.
<lb/>He showed the Iranians too all that Hurmuzd
<lb/>Had written of them. The warriors acclaimed;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>‘Earth’s surface shook.</q>
<lb/>He sent too
<lb/>The honourable safe-conduct for Parmuda,
<lb/>Giv’n by the monarch, to the hold to him;
<lb/>His darkened soul grew bright. With many blessings
<lb/>Upon the king he left his famous fortress,
<lb/>And leaving to Bahram Chubina all
<lb/>The wealth therein made ready to depart.
<lb/>Descending from the hold the proud Parmuda
<lb/>Bestrode his charger swift as flying dust,
<pb n="8.144"/>
<lb/>And set forth with his troops without regard
<lb/>To bold Bahram Chubina who chagrined
<lb/>Thereat, and though his captive was a king,
<lb/>Sent after him and had him brought afoot,
<lb/>And running in the presence of the troops;
<lb/>Then said to him indignantly: <q>Are such
<lb/>Your manners in Turan and Chin—to go
<lb/>Without leave asked of me? Sheer folly this!</q>
<lb/>Parmuda said: <q>Once I was raised o’er folk,
<lb/>But now am humbled and a suppliant,
<lb/>Cast vilely from the zenith of my power.
<lb/>To-day withal thou art not generous
<lb/>In bringing me before thee, evil one!
<lb/>Now that I have the letter of safe-conduct
<lb/>I purpose going to the king. Perchance
<lb/>He will receive me brother-like; misfortune
<lb/>May grow more light to me. What wouldst thou more?
<lb/>I have surrendered fortune, home, and goods.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina raged with flashing eyes
<lb/>In indignation at Parmuda’s words,
<lb/>And struck him in excitement with a whip—
<lb/>Behaviour only fit for miscreants.
<lb/>They bound Parmuda’s feet forthwith and made
<lb/>A scanty tent his prison. Said thereat
<milestone unit="calced" n="1838"/>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin: <q>This paladin
<lb/>And wisdom are not mates!</q>
<lb/>He sought the archscribe,
<lb/>And said: <q>This mighty paladin possesseth
<lb/>Not one gnat’s wing of wisdom!</q> <note>Reading with P.</note> so he taketh
<lb/>No heed of any one, and we must go,
<lb/>And say to him: <q>This is remediless.
<lb/>His temper is his great calamity.</q>
<lb/>The two departed to Bahram Chubina
<lb/>With pallid cheeks and counsel on their tongues,
<pb n="8.145"/>
<lb/>And told him: <q>Thou hast given to the winds
<lb/>Thy toil! Oh! be that noble head of thine
<lb/>Unfilled with fire!</q>
<lb/>Ware of his foul behaviour,
<lb/>That into water had been flung a brick
<lb/>Already dried, he in his penitence
<lb/>Released the Khan and was in great concern.
<lb/>He sent the Khan a steed with golden trappings,
<lb/>And Indian falchion with a golden scabbard,
<lb/>Moreover went forthwith to him to make
<lb/>His dark soul bright, there tarried till the Khan
<lb/>Had armed and mounted on a speedy steed,
<lb/>And then escorted him upon his way,
<lb/>Perceiving that the prince’s visage loured.
<lb/>When it was time to part Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Told him: <q>Thou hast a secret grudge against me;
<lb/>Yet, though it be so, tell it not the Shah;
<lb/>No credit will result to thee therefrom.</q>
<lb/>The Khan replied to him: <q>It is of fortune
<lb/>That I complain; I leave it all to God.
<lb/>I am not such an one as would desire
<lb/>To speak in many words of other men;
<lb/>Still if thy monarch hath no news hereof
<lb/>He is not worthy of his high estate.
<lb/>It was the turning sky that fettered me;
<lb/>I tell not of ill usage from a slave.</q>
<lb/>Thereat Bahram Chubina paled; he writhed,
<lb/>But with an effort swallowed down his wrath,
<lb/>And thus returned reply: <q>An instance this
<lb/>Of what the famous nobles used to say:—
<lb/><q>Forbear thine utmost seed of ill to cast,
<lb/>For time will give thee fruit thereof at last.</q> <note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>To what end did I deck for thee my heart,
<lb/>Attempt to do thee kindness in the world,
<lb/>And wrote its lord a letter hiding all
<pb n="8.146"/>
<lb/>Thine own shortcomings?</q> <q>That,</q> the Khan rejoined,
<lb/><q>Is past, and all the past hath turned to wind.
<lb/>By God! I do not owe thee any grudge,
<lb/>Or cherish in my heart the former strife.
<lb/>Thy kindness hath been greater than this wrong,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1839"/>
<lb/>And thou didst guide me on the way to good;
<lb/>But just as there is insolence in war,
<lb/>So is there courtesy in time of peace,
<lb/>And if the two are all the same to thee
<lb/>Thy wisdom out of question is but small,
<lb/>And when a leader is too wise to take
<lb/>His lord’s commands then evil will befall him.
<lb/>Moreover one should tread God’s path and purge
<lb/>All darkness from the heart. 'Twere well for thee
<lb/>To say no more for past ill is but wind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On hearing this Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>Methought 'twould out, but no mishap will come
<lb/>Of thy complaint for I will hide it up
<lb/>With painted silk. On thine arrival say
<lb/>Whate’er thou wilt; 'twill minish not my lustre.</q>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Every king that taketh not
<lb/>Account of good and ill, but passeth over
<lb/>His slave’s misdeeds in silence, be assured
<lb/>Is witless, and when malcontents afar—
<lb/>Allies or other kings—observe this thing
<lb/>They will term thee unseemly and light-headed,
<lb/>And him the foolish monarch of Iran.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina paled, and when Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, had taken note thereof
<lb/>He feared that, wrathful and bloodthirsty man
<lb/>Would hurl Parmuda from his steed to dust,
<lb/>And said: <q>O general of the Shah! repress
<lb/>Thy wrath and quit that path because the Khan
<lb/>Saith well, so list to him and think no ill,
<lb/>For had cool words ne’er passed the hearts of neither
<pb n="8.147"/>
<lb/>Would have been pained.</q> <q>This ill-conditioned one,</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said, <q>would join his sire.</q>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Wrong me not. Reft as I am
<lb/>Of mine own father I may well die young.
<lb/>All those that in the world are like thyself,
<lb/>With heads all dust-cloud and with hearts all fume,
<lb/>Imagine ill, accord to none, but raise
<lb/>Themselves by craft and cruelty. I fear not
<lb/>The king of kings; from him bale or relief
<lb/>Is well. He is my peer among the great,
<lb/>And not a slave malignantly disposed
<lb/>Towards me, but is gentle, wise, high-born,
<lb/>And greatly mindful of the men of name.
<lb/>I charge thee by the soul and by the head
<lb/>Of Shah Hurmuzd that thou return forthwith.
<lb/>Give me no more replies and insolence;
<lb/>Say naught and hear naught.</q> When Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Heard he returned to camp in vengeful mood,
<lb/>And thus that proven warrior harangued
<lb/>The prudent chiefs: <q>Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>And those wise men, the archscribe and archmages,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1840"/>
<lb/>Shall write a letter to the world’s king, telling
<lb/>All that hath passed in public and in private.</q>
<lb/>The general said further to the chief
<lb/>And other archimages: <q>Men of wisdom!
<lb/>Depart hence to the hold, be diligent,
<lb/>Companion with the wind and ascertain
<lb/>What quantity of wealth is hoarded there.</q>
<lb/>With fearful hearts the scribes set forth. From dawn
<lb/>Until three watches of the night had passed
<lb/>They blacked much paper but they had not done.
<lb/>There was not room to move for precious things,
<pb n="8.148"/>
<lb/>Hoards of the era of Afrasiyab,
<lb/>And of Arjasp, so ancient yet unspent,
<lb/>Gold coins and jewels won from sea and mine
<lb/>By favour of the sky; such were the treasures
<lb/>Within Awaza hold world-famous then.
<lb/>Among the goods of Siyawush came first
<lb/>A belt with jewelled buckles and such earrings
<lb/>As no one high or low besides possessed,
<lb/>Which Kai Khusrau had given Luhrasp and he
<lb/>Thereafter gave them to Gushtasp. Arjasp
<lb/>Gat them and stored them there, none knoweth when.
<lb/>They wrote a list of all the precious things
<lb/>That were laid up within the treasury,
<lb/>But no one in the world, astrologer,
<lb/>Or noble prince had knowledge of the sum.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina sent a scribe, a man
<lb/>Shrewd, eloquent, and mindful, who collected
<lb/>The booty from the hold and battlefield.
<lb/>There were a pair of earrings in the spoil,
<lb/>And pair of boots with patterns formed by gems;
<lb/>The stuff was interwoven with gold threads
<lb/>Bestrung with precious stones. There were withal
<lb/>Two gold-embroidered curtains from Yaman,
<lb/>Whereof each one was seven mans in weight.
<lb/>Now through presumption and perversity
<lb/>The captain of the host, contemplating
<lb/>No scrutiny, put secretly aside
<lb/>The pairs of boots and curtains of Yaman,
<lb/>And made no entry of them in his list.
<lb/>He then gave orders to Izid Gashasp
<lb/>That he and all his cavaliers should mount,
<lb/>Select a thousand warriors from the host,
<lb/>And take the booty to the monarch’s gate.
<lb/>The warriors having mounted on their steeds,
<pb n="8.149"/>
<lb/>Izid Gashasp bore off that mass of spoil,
<lb/>And full of joy and merriment they took
<lb/>A hundred caravan-loads to Iran.
<lb/>Iranian horsemen closed the long array,
<lb/>The Khan with his own nobles led the way.

<lb/>With treasure, gifts, and troops the Khan drew near
<lb/>The monarch of the world who heard and mounted
<lb/>With crown on head and mace in hand, and thus
<lb/>Came to the gate. When from the porch he saw
<lb/>The visage of the Khan he paused to note
<lb/>If at the sight of him that prince and troops
<lb/>Would light down from their steeds. Parmuda watched,
<lb/>Full of concern, if he would turn away,
<lb/>Then, mounted still, came with the archimage,
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, whereat the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Bestirred him with his troops. The Khan alighted
<lb/>And hastened toward the Shah, without delay
<lb/>Remounting his black Arab, while the Great King
<lb/>Abode not with Parmiuda in the porch,
<lb/>And rode his fleet steed off; but when the Khan
<lb/>Was following, the keeper of the curtain
<lb/>Laid hold upon his reins forthwith. Parmuda
<lb/>Alighted instantly and manifested
<lb/>His own diplomacy by that submission.
<lb/>Now when the Khan approached the royal throne
<lb/>The king of kings received him with all favour,

<lb/>And charged therewith the keeper of the camels.
<lb/>The eighth day, when Parmiuda was refreshed
<lb/>From all his toils, the Shah ordained a feast,
<lb/>And, when the Khan was seated at the board
<lb/>At court and in the presence of the world-lord,
<lb/>Bade bring the camel-loads before the chiefs.
<lb/>One counted up the porters; on that day
<lb/>There were ten thousand hired. The next, at dawn,
<lb/>Hurmuzd had wine set forth and took his seat,
<lb/>And from the park came fifty thousand bales
<lb/>As well as parcels on the porters’ backs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1842"/>
<lb/>The baggage filled a hundred treasuries.
<lb/>The Shah, when his task was achieved, bade bring
<lb/>Before the presence publicly a bale
<lb/>Of stuffs, bejewelled earrings, and a girdle
<lb/>Compact, thou wouldst have said, of gold and gems.
<lb/>These he bestowed with many words of praise
<lb/>Upon the messenger who kissed the ground,
<lb/>While from the banquet-hall arose acclaim:—
<lb/><q>Victorious be the Shah.</q>
<lb/>He at that time
<lb/>Said to his confidant Izid Gashasp<note>Perhaps we ought to read <quote>Ayin Gashasp</quote> here and below. See pp. 75, 174 seq.</note>
<lb/>:—
<lb/><q>What seest thou in Bahram Chubina’s exploit?
<lb/>He maketh war to cease right manfully.</q>
<lb/>The scribe Izid Gashasp replied: <q>O Shah,
<lb/>Who art observant and of ardent mind!
<lb/>When at a feast the theme is such know there
<lb/>Will likewise be but ill-conditioned fare.</q> <note>With changes of reading Mohl translates: <cit><quote xml:lang="fra">sache que les mets d'une féte ou c’est le mot corneille (<foreign>djoubin</foreign>) qui forme le refrain doivent étre étranges.</quote> <bibl>Mohl</bibl></cit></note>
<pb n="8.151"/>
<lb/>The Shah became suspiciously inclined
<lb/>On hearing this; misdoubtings filled his mind.

<p>
<lb/>Then came a lusty camel-post and brought
<lb/>This letter from the archscribe: <q>May the world-lord
<lb/>Be ever joyful and his head and crown
<lb/>For ever present in his servant’s thoughts.
<lb/>Know that there were two curtains of Yaman
<lb/>Among the spoil, boots decked with gems uncut,
<lb/>The earrings too of noble Siyawush,
<lb/>Who left us wisdom as his monument,
<lb/>And these the paladin bare off with him</q> <note>Reading with P.</note> 
<lb/>No marvel since he underwent the toil.
<lb/>Hurmuzd said to Parmida: <q>Tell me all
<lb/>That thou didst see hereof.</q>
<lb/>The fallen king
<lb/>Confirmed the scribe’s report. The haughty Shah
<lb/>Was wroth thereat and said: <q>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Doth err, uplifting to the moon his head.
<lb/>For one thing he hath struck the Khan of Chin—
<lb/>An act the outcome of an evil nature—
<lb/>And then would nothing but these earrings serve
<lb/>His turn? Perhaps he hath become a king.
<lb/>His toil hath turned to wind and all his knowledge
<lb/>And justice have become corrupt.</q> This said,
<lb/>He called the Khan and having seated him
<lb/>Upon the famous throne they feasted there
<pb n="8.152"/>
<lb/>Till night spread out her musky tresses black.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1843"/>
<lb/>Then said the Shah: <q>If thou wilt league with me
<lb/>Thou shalt partake my honey.</q> As he sat
<lb/>He grasped the Khan‘s hand, and Parmida marvelled.
<lb/>The Shah proceeded: <q>Swear to me afresh,
<lb/>And make a new departure, not to break
<lb/>With me or with the nobles of this folk
<lb/>On thy return.</q> Parmida swore forthwith:—
<lb/><q>By shining daylight and night azure-dim,
<lb/>By God who hath of right supremacy,
<lb/>The Artificer of Jupiter and Venus,
<lb/>The great Shah’s crown and throne, Azargashasp,
<lb/>The signet and the diadem, the Khan
<lb/>Shall not grow alien from the Shah in heart,
<lb/>And vex him not in aught.</q> This sworn, they rose
<lb/>And sought their couches.
<lb/>When the yellow sun
<lb/>O’er-topped the mountains, and the kings awoke,
<lb/>The noble Shah prepared a present—ware
<lb/>Of gold and silver, horses, coronets,
<lb/>Of girdles gemmed and golden, armlets, torques,
<lb/>And earrings, Arab steeds with golden trappings,
<lb/>And Indian scimitars with golden sheaths,
<lb/>Dispatched them to the Khan, consorted with him
<lb/>Two stages and the more part of the third,
<lb/>And having bidden him farewell returned.
<lb/>The paladin, on hearing of the gifts
<lb/>Presented by the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And how the Khan was coming back rejoicing,
<lb/>Rode forth to meet him with the Iranian chiefs.
<lb/>He stored provisions where the Khan would pass
<lb/>In town and village, station, hill, and plain,
<pb n="8.153"/>
<lb/>And hurried on in shame at his ill temper
<lb/>To make excuse in person. When he saw
<lb/>Parmida he did reverence but the Khan
<lb/>Proved wholly adverse, would accept of naught
<lb/>That he had brought of provand, purse, or slave,
<lb/>And on the way ignored him utterly.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina fared three stages thus,
<lb/>And not once did Parmida call for him.
<lb/>Upon the fourth the Khan sent one to say:—
<lb/><q>Return for thou hast toiled enough.</q>
<lb/>Thereat
<lb/>Bahram Chubina left him and in wrath
<lb/>Set face toward Balkh where he abode in dudgeon,
<lb/>Repenting of his acts with aching heart.
<lb/>Withal the world-lord was displeased with him,
<lb/>And fumes of anger filled the monarch’s soul
<milestone unit="calced" n="1844"/>
<lb/>First at that outrage to the Khan wherein
<lb/>Bahram Chubina had done shamefully.
<lb/>And next that he had dared to lay his hand
<lb/>On certain of the spoil without command.

<lb/>The king then wrote thus to Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/><q>Unconscionable div! perceiv’st thou not
<lb/>That all our excellencies are from God,
<lb/>And yet thou sittest on the vault of heaven?
<lb/>Hast thou forgot my pains, troops, toil, and treasure?

<lb/>The Shah, when he had sealed this, ordered one
<lb/>To bring him a black distaff-case with distaff
<lb/>And cotton, much unworthy gear, withal
<lb/>A blue silk shift, red drawers, and yellow coif,
<lb/>Chose an ignoble messenger to match
<lb/>With that unseemly gift and said: <q>Convey

<lb/>The messenger, these words in mind,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><head>How Bahram Chubina put on the Woman's Dress and showed himself therein to the Chiefs of the Host</head>
<p>
<lb/>Whenas Bahram Chubina saw the present
<lb/>Sent with the letter he endured in silence.
<lb/>He thought: <q>This is my guerdon! So the Shah
<lb/>Is now my foe though he hath not devised
<lb/>This wrong but mine ill-wishers slandered me.
<lb/>The world-lord is the master of his slaves,
<lb/>And if he putteth me to shame 'tis well.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1845"/>
<lb/>I did not think that enemies of mine
<lb/>Had access to the Shah. Since I left court
<lb/>In haste with but few troops all men have witnessed
<lb/>My deeds, my sorrows and my toils and hardships.
<pb n="8.155"/>
<lb/>If these toils are rewarded by a shame
<lb/>That is the portion of the infamous
<lb/>I will complain of circling heaven to God
<lb/>For having docked me thus of all its love.</q>
<lb/>He called upon the Judge that giveth good,
<lb/>Then, having donned the red and yellow garb,
<lb/>And set before him the black spindle-case,
<lb/>And all the other things sent by the Shah,
<lb/>He summoned to him all the mighty men,
<lb/>The nobles of the monarch of the world.
<lb/>These came forth from the army to the chief,
<lb/>Whose gloomy soul was full of anxious thoughts.
<lb/>They came, both young and old, were all astound,
<lb/>And mused, on seeing their paladin so clad.
<lb/>He said: <q>A robe of honour from the Shah!
<lb/>Ye saw and heard of what I did and how
<lb/>I combated with my two-headed dart.
<lb/>The Shah despaired about the royal throne;
<lb/>The world was dark and I illumined it.
<lb/>I have put on me this repugnant garb
<lb/>According to the exalted king’s command.
<lb/>The Shah is world-lord and we are his slaves,
<lb/>Our hearts and souls are full of love for him.
<lb/>What are your views, ye witnesses! herein?
<lb/>What answer make we to the king of earth?</q>
<lb/>All cried: <q>Famed paladin and worshipful!
<lb/>If this be thy worth with the Shah the troops
<lb/>Are dogs at court! Note what the ancient sage
<lb/>Observed at Rai when angry with Ardshir:—
<lb/>'I grow averse from archmage and Shah’s throne
<lb/>When he regardeth not my weal and woe.'
<lb/>How canst thou seek for honour from a man
<lb/>That honoureth not thee?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>Forbear:
<lb/>The Shah is source of honour to his troops;
<lb/>His slaves are we; he giveth, we receive.</q>
<pb n="8.156"/>
<lb/>The Iranians said: <q>We will not arm henceforth;
<lb/>We will not have him in Iran as Shah,
<lb/>Or, as our general, Bahram Chubina.</q>
<lb/>They spake and went forth from his presence, left
<lb/>The palace of the chieftain<note>Reading with P.</note> for the plain,
<lb/>But he refrained his lips and at the most
<lb/>Gave only prudent counsels to the host.

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><head>How Bahram Chubina went to hunt and saw a Lady who foretold the Future to him</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1846"/>
<lb/>Two weeks passed, then Bahram Chubina left
<lb/>His palace for the waste. In front of him
<lb/>There was a forest furnished well with trees—
<lb/>The very place for lucky revellers.
<lb/>Upon the mead he saw an onager,
<lb/>And none will see a fairer one. He followed
<lb/>At leisure, heating not his steed. Appeared
<lb/>Within that woodland-chase a narrow path,
<lb/>Which when that gallant onager had traversed
<lb/>A pleasance next was seen upon the plain.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, marking this, proceeded
<lb/>Until a splendid palace came in sight.
<lb/>Led by the onager he turned and rode
<lb/>Thereto; behind him was Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>To whom he gave his fleet steed’s reins and said:—
<lb/><q>May wisdom ever be thy mate,</q> then entered
<lb/>The porch alone. Izid Gashasp the while
<lb/>Abode without and held the noble steed.
<lb/>Behind him hurrying came Yalan-sina
<pb n="8.157"/>
<lb/>Armed on a swift horse. Brave Izid Gashasp
<lb/>Said: <q>Lion! enter thou and find out whither
<lb/>Our chief, the heroic captain of the host,
<lb/>Our succourer, hath gone.</q>
<lb/>Yalan-sina
<lb/>Made for the palace with an anxious heart
<lb/>To seek the chief. He saw it and its hall
<lb/>Magnifical; its like he had not seen
<lb/>Or heard of in Iran. Upon one side
<lb/>Thereof there was a cupola whose top
<lb/>Was viewless through its height and under it
<lb/>A throne of gold with steps begemmed. The throne
<lb/>Was covered with brocade of Rum in patterns
<lb/>Picked out with jewels on a ground of gold.
<lb/>Upon the throne there sat a lady crowned,
<lb/>Of cypress-height and with a face like Spring. <note>Three couplets omitted.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1847"/>
<lb/>Beside it was a seat and thereupon
<lb/>The captain of the host while many slaves,
<lb/>Idols fay-faced and blooming, were around.
<lb/>On seeing Yalan-sina the lady bade
<lb/>A handmaid: <q>Hasten to yon lion-heart,
<lb/>Fair mate, and say: 'Thou mayst not enter here.
<lb/>Stay with thy comrades. He will come anon,
<lb/>But go thou first. As from Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Speak this and ease them as to his return.'</q>
<lb/>She sent some also to his retinue
<lb/>To bring the warriors’ horses to the stalls,
<lb/>And take good care of all their equipage.
<lb/>The gardener unlocked the garden-gate
<lb/>By hest of that fair hostess, <note>Couplet omitted.</note> and they set
<lb/>About the garden victuals past conceit.
<lb/>Whenas the warriors had eaten bread
<lb/>They led the chargers to the place assigned.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, when he left the lady,
<lb/>Spake thus: <q>May Jupiter espouse thy crown.</q>
<pb n="8.158"/>
<lb/>She answered: <q>Be victorious and ever
<lb/>Of patient heart and wise.</q> <note>Couplet omitted.</note> <q>Go thou! the throne
<lb/>And the Iranian diadem are thine.
<lb/>The world shall be set straight by thee, so win it
<lb/>By might and sword from dark dust to the stars.</q> <note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>Now when he came forth from that garth of roses
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>He weepeth blood!</q>
<lb/>So changed
<lb/>Was he in temper and in talk that thou
<lb/>Hadst said: <q>He raiseth to the Pleiades
<lb/>His head.</q> Anon the onager appeared;
<lb/>The chieftain followed after on his steed,
<lb/>And it was so that till he cleared the forest
<lb/>The onager still served him as a guide.
<lb/>He went back to the city from the chase,
<lb/>But spake not of the matter to the host.
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, regarded him
<lb/>And said thus: <q>O thou chief that speakest sooth!
<lb/>What was this marvel seen and heard by none
<lb/>That happened in the chase?</q>
<lb/>The paladin
<lb/>Vouchsafed no answer but in dudgeon sought
<lb/>The palace, and none else dared ask: <q>What might
<lb/>This matter mean, this vision of delight?</q>
</p>

<lb/>The next day, when the uplands silvered over,
<lb/>And when yon yellow shining Lamp appeared,
<pb n="8.159"/>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina spread a carpeting
<lb/>Made of brocade of Chin, and thou hadst said
<lb/>That earth had turned to sky. Throughout the palace
<lb/>He ranged gold seats and cushions of brocade
<lb/>Of gold. They placed a golden ante-throne
<lb/>Whereon the captain of the host sat down,
<lb/>Then held a session like the king of kings,
<lb/>And placed upon his head the crown of greatness.
<lb/>The archscribe marked Bahram Chubina’s conduct,
<lb/>And, knowing him to be both bold and strong,
<lb/>Went and retailed his knowledge, sight or hearsay,
<lb/>Before Kharrad, son of Barzin, who listened,
<lb/>Knew that his own toils had been vain, and said:—
<lb/><q>Take not this lightly, O thou noble scribe!
<lb/>This king of kings of ours hath played the fool
<lb/>In sending as a gift the distaff-case,
<lb/>Not knowing that this battle-loving Lion
<lb/>Would thus revolt. We must not talk of this,
<lb/>But when 'tis midnight fare forth to the Shah,
<lb/>And say: <q>Bahram Chubina’s heart is set
<lb/>Upon the crown; the seat too under him
<lb/>Is ivory.</q></q>
<lb/>They canvassed all the case,
<lb/>And made a shift to flee, prepared the pretext,
<lb/>And fled from Balkh by night. The chief, informed
<lb/>Thereof, and knowing well their clear, shrewd minds,
<lb/>Said to Yalan-sina: <q>Go in pursuit
<lb/>Of those two dotards with a hundred horse.</q>
<lb/>He overtook the archscribe, raged at him,
<lb/>As 'twere a wolf, took from him all he had,
<lb/>And brought him back made fast in heavy bonds,
<lb/>Back to Bahram Chubina so that he
<lb/>Might slay the innocent. The paladin
<lb/>Said: <q>Doer of div’s work! why didst thou quit me
<pb n="8.160"/>
<lb/>Without my leave?</q> <q>O paladin!</q> he answered,
<lb/><q>Kharrad, son of Barzin, made me afraid.
<lb/>He said: 'We may not tarry; thy delay
<lb/>Will please those only that speak ill of thee,
<lb/>For when the heroic captain of the host,
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, holdeth court as Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1849"/>
<lb/>There is a fear lest thou and I be slain

<lb/><q>Just so: one must consult o’er good and ill.</q>
<lb/>He then restored and with advantages
<lb/>From his own treasures what the scribe had lost,

<lb/>To whom he told his news, suppressing naught,
<lb/>Of wood and meadow, course of onager,

<lb/>Told of the palace and the jewelled throne,
<lb/>The slave-girls and the lady with the crown:
<lb/>He told whatever he had seen and heard.
<lb/>The Shah mused at the tale, laid it to heart,
<lb/>And sighed as he remembered what the archmage
<lb/>And fortune-teller had said: <q>Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Will turn him from thy throne.</q><note n="1">See pp. 107, 108.</note>
<pb n="8.161"/>
<lb/>Forthwith he summoned
<lb/>The high priest, set Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Within the room and said to him: <q>Relate
<lb/>The adventures of thy journey.</q>
<lb/>Thus enjoined
<lb/>He oped his lips and told it all. The Shah
<lb/>Said to the high priest: <q>What importeth this?
<lb/>We must consult at large. The onager
<lb/>That led him through the wood, the palace seen
<lb/>Amidst the wilderness, the lady crowned
<lb/>Upon the golden throne, the slaves in waiting
<lb/>As on a queen—the account is like a dream
<lb/>Suggested by old tales!</q>
<lb/>The high priest thus
<lb/>Made answer to the monarch of the world:—
<lb/><q>Beneath that onager there was a div
<lb/>Who sought to lead Bahram Chubina wrong,
<lb/>And make perverseness show within his heart.
<lb/>The palace, be assured, was sorcerer’s work,
<lb/>The lady on the throne an impious witch,
<lb/>Who on this wise to hearten him the more
<lb/>Displayed the crown and throne of majesty.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1850"/>
<lb/>All eager and bemused he went from her:
<lb/>Be sure that he will ne’er come back to hand.
<lb/>His heart was wounded by thy distaff-case,
<lb/>And going to that div-witch made it worse.
<lb/>It was not well to send the ignoble robe
<lb/>To one so overweening, for thereby
<lb/>The Iranians were estranged and ceased to trust
<lb/>The king of kings. So now devise a scheme
<lb/>To bring the army back to court from Balkh.</q>
<lb/>The king repented having acted so
<lb/>About the cotton and the gaudy dress,
<lb/>And asked Kharrad, son of Barzin: <q>What say
<lb/>The troops there of that lady?</q>
<lb/>He replied:—
<pb n="8.162"/>
<lb/><q>As for that crownéd lady, all the troops
<lb/>Call her, O king! 'Bahram Chubina’s Luck,'
<lb/>Which will be very great and glorious.</q>
<lb/>The king, on hearing, greatly feared the ills
<lb/>That fortune had in store. Ere long there came
<lb/>One from the paladin, the cavalier,
<lb/>And brought a frail of swords with points all bent.<note n="2"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">par usage qu'on en avait fait dans la bataille.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>He set them down before the Shah who looked
<lb/>Upon that iron gear, bade break the swords,
<lb/>Replace them in that ill-conditioned frail,
<lb/>And then return them to Bahram Chubina:
<lb/>No word was spoken but the intent was clear.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina oped the frail, beheld
<lb/>The long swords snapped at point and then replaced,
<lb/>And, wayward as he was, grew full of thought.
<lb/>He called the Iranians round the frail and said:—
<lb/><q>Behold the king’s gift! Underrate it not.
<lb/>It meaneth that this host is little worth,
<lb/>And not the head of one of us will scape.</q>
<lb/>The troops thought much of what the Shah had done,
<lb/>And of their paladin’s address. They said:—
<lb/><q>One day our monarch sendeth us as gifts
<lb/>A distaff and a gaudy robe; anon
<lb/>He giveth broken swords—a present worse
<lb/>Than striking or abuse. Ne’er be such Shah
<lb/>Upon the throne! May none remember him,
<lb/>And if again the offspring of Gashasp—
<lb/>Bahram Chubina—ride on that court’s dust
<lb/>Then may they perish, skin and marrow both,
<lb/>He and his worthless sire!</q>
<lb/>The chieftain heard,
<lb/>Saw how Hurmuz had vexed the host and said:—
<lb/><q>Be vigilant and let your minds be clear
<milestone unit="calced" n="1851"/>
<lb/>Because Kharrad, son of Barzin, hath told

<lb/>Our secrets to the king. Let each consult

<lb/>If I send none to watch our enemies
<lb/>Regard my days as done, my soldiers slain.</q>
<lb/>He spake and took new order: mark and muse.
<lb/>He scattered horsemen through the realm lest letters,
<lb/>Sent by the king, should reach the Iranians,
<lb/>And they should arm themselves to fight for him,
<lb/>And so it was that till a time had gone
<lb/>A royal letter was perused by none.

<lb/>Bahram Chubina summoned then the chiefs,
<lb/>And told them many secrets. There were present
<lb/>Hamdan Gashasp and the archscribe, Yalan-sina,
<lb/>Renowned and strong, with valorous Bahram,
<lb/>The son of Siyawush, and that wise chief,
<lb/>Kanda Gashasp. With these he held debate,
<lb/>For they were Lions and men of war, and then
<lb/>Harangued that fierce host, which was all astray,
<lb/>Thus: <q>Famous chiefs whose counsel all require!
<lb/>The Shah is wroth with us without a cause,
<lb/>And so hath turned away from what is right.
<lb/>What will ye do? What is the remedy?
<lb/>Tis useless to shed tears upon the past.
<lb/>Whoe’er hath hid his anguish from the leech
<lb/>Hath showered from his lashes tears of blood,
<lb/>And trifles grow in moment when we keep
<lb/>Our secrets from the men of understanding.
<pb n="8.164"/>
<lb/>I have myself my privy griefs and I
<lb/>Will tell them to the sages of the world.
<lb/>Ye all are conversant with these affairs,
<lb/>And so can testify to what I say.
<lb/>We left Iran by order of the Shah
<lb/>With but few troops, though eager to engage,
<lb/>And none, though long his life, will see a foe
<lb/>More numerous. Now if the Turk Parmuda,
<lb/>Had, with king Sawa, marched upon Iran
<lb/>It would not have been worth a piece of wax,
<lb/>And later they would have attempted Rum;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1852"/>
<lb/>But on Parmuda and king Sawa came
<lb/>A marvel such as none within the world
<lb/>Had seen, and though we bore much toil ourselves
<lb/>We left them neither elephants nor treasure.
<lb/>The Shah hath laid up wealth anew, grown rich,
<lb/>And yet he is enraged against the host
<lb/>Though all the business hath been done for him,
<lb/>And he is franchised through no toil of his!<note>Couplet transposed.</note>
<lb/>In such a coil what shift shall I employ
<lb/>To set my head at ease? Do ye too all
<lb/>Shift for yourselves. What is your remedy
<lb/>For such a wound? I have discharged my heart,
<lb/>And freed my soul. Respecting weal or woe
<lb/>If ye are ware of any means now speak.</q>
<lb/>He proved with these words, for he feared, the host.
<lb/>Behind his curtains that famed paladin
<lb/>Possessed a sister, one of ardent soul,
<lb/>And that wise lady’s name was Gurdya,
<lb/>Of fairy-visage and his heart’s delight.
<lb/>Now she, on hearing from behind the veil
<lb/>Her brother’s words, was angered; her heart flared.
<lb/>With much to say and full of instances
<lb/>She came forth to that conclave, and her brother
<lb/>Kept silence, when he heard her voice, from word
<pb n="8.165"/>
<lb/>And answer, and the Iranians too were silent
<lb/>For fear of harm. Thus Gurdya addressed
<lb/>The troops: <q>Illustrious men who seek for guidance!
<lb/>Why do ye hold your peace and check your spleen?
<lb/>Ye are the warrior-chieftains of Iran,
<lb/>Wise, prescient lords. What see ye in this matter?
<lb/>What game play ye upon this scene of blood?</q>
<lb/>Then said Izid Gashasp, the cavalier:—
<lb/><q>Memorial of the mighty! were our tongues
<lb/>Sharp swords they would take flight before the sea
<lb/>Of thine advice. Thine acts are all of God,
<lb/>Brave, learned, and wise. We need not fight like
<lb/>And cavalierly counter cavaliers,
<lb/>While if the paladin is pleased with me
<lb/>Methinketh that I shall be young for ever.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing him thus speak,
<lb/>Saw that he dealt with both sides. Then he marked
<lb/>Yalan-sina and said: <q>What thinkest thou?</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1853"/>
<lb/>Quoth he: <q>Brave chief! the walker in God’s way
<lb/>Will be wise, famed, and learned, will have his will
<lb/>In all and, winning victory and grace,
<lb/>Will haste not to do ill for that would turn
<lb/>A blessing to a curse and circling heaven
<lb/>Be vengeful towards him. God hath given thee
<lb/>Grace, fortune, troops withal, wealth, prowess, throne;
<lb/>If thou art grateful He will send thee more,
<lb/>But through ingratitude the heart will ache.</q>
<lb/>Then said Bahram Chubina to Bahram—
<lb/><q>Wise friend and prudent mate! what sayest thou
<lb/>About this seeking after throne and treasure?
<lb/>Will majesty result or pain and grief?</q>
<lb/>He laughed that such a case should be discussed,
<pb n="8.166"/>
<lb/>Then tossing up his finger-ring replied:—
<lb/><q>As long as this remaineth in the air
<lb/>So long shall it be servant to the Shah;
<lb/>Yet he is great; despise him not for none
<lb/>Should under-estimate the diadem.</q>
<lb/>Said to Kanda Gashasp<note>Reading with P. C. has Izid Gashasp</note> Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/><q>O thou sword-wielding and steed-spurring Lion!
<lb/>What seest and sayst thou touching this affair
<lb/>Of ours? Do we deserve the royal throne?</q>
<lb/>That cavalier replied: <q>O thou that art
<lb/>The memory of heroes in the world!
<lb/>There was an archimage at Rai who said:—
<lb/><q>The wise and lucky man to whom ’tis given
<lb/>Once to be king his soul will soar to heaven.</q>
<lb/>So aiming at the treasure of the king
<lb/>Is better than to be long years a slave.</q>
<lb/>Then to the archscribe said Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/><q>Old wolf! unclose thy lips.</q>
<lb/>The archscribe kept
<lb/>His lips still shut awhile and sat amid
<lb/>A crowd of thoughts, then said: <q>Whoe’er shall seek
<lb/>His wish in fitting fashion will attain it,
<lb/>For time’s stretched hand is long. Know that no pains
<lb/>Can shun whatever God will have to be.</q>
<lb/>Then said the chieftain to Hamdan Gashasp:—
<lb/><q>O thou well versed in fortune’s rise and fall!
<lb/>Whatever thou shalt utter in our presence
<lb/>Shall be as wind and, like wind, hurt thee not.
<lb/>Advise us in this case, this test of good
<lb/>And evil fortune.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Great Hamdan Gashasp
<lb/>Thus spake: <q>Prized by the great! why dost thou dread
<lb/>Ills not yet come and question of the crown
<pb n="8.167"/>
<lb/>Of kingship? Act and leave the rest to God.
<lb/>Why reach out for the date if thou dost fear
<milestone unit="calced" n="1854"/>
<lb/>The thorn? A people’s Head hath never rest;
<lb/>His mind is fearful and his body weary.</q>
<lb/>The sister of the captain of the host
<lb/>Writhed at their words and grew o’ercast of soul,
<lb/>Yet spake she naught in this debate from eve
<lb/>Till midnight. Then Bahram Chubina said:
<lb/><q>What thinkest thou of this assembly’s words,
<lb/>Fair lady?</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Gurdya made no reply;
<lb/>The counsels of the chief displeasured her.
<lb/>Thereafter she addressed the archscribe thus:—
<lb/><q>O man maleficent like some old wolf!
<lb/>So thou conceivest that the crown and throne,
<lb/>Host and addition and the might of fortune
<lb/>Were in the world no objects of desire
<lb/>To any famous chiefs of generous bent
<lb/>Though kingship easier is than servitude!
<lb/>Such sentiments as thine demand our tears.
<lb/>Take we the precedents of former Shahs,
<lb/>And hear the sayings of those greater ones.</q>
<lb/>The archscribe made response: <q>If rede of mine
<lb/>Obtain not with thee, speak and do whatever
<lb/>Thou art advised and follow thy heart’s lead.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Then likewise to self-willed Bahram Chubina
<lb/>His sister spake and said: <q>They are not good,
<lb/>Thy knowledge and thy counsel, and thy steps
<lb/>Are tending toward deceit. Full many a time
<lb/>Hath the Shah’s throne been void and yet no chief
<lb/>Cast any look upon it. It was theirs
<lb/>To guard the world by valour, not to have
<lb/>An eye upon the throne. They did not aim
<lb/>Thereat but girt their loins to serve. They sought
<lb/>Their sovereigns’ weal and rendered hearty service.
<lb/>They were no strangers to the throne and crown,
<pb n="8.168"/>

<lb/>But worthy of their greatness by descent.
<lb/>I speak first of the case of Shah Kaus,<note>See Vol. ii. p. 102 seq.</note>
<lb/>Who would have searched the mysteries of God,
<lb/>Have summed the stars and trod heaven’s circling dome,
<lb/>But fell despised and wretched at Sarf
<lb/>Through his perverseness and ill bent, and yet
<lb/>Gudarz and Rustam, who was paladin,
<lb/>Did not take dudgeon, and thereafter when
<lb/>Kaus went to Hamavaran,<note>Id. p. 82 seq.</note> and folk
<lb/>Bound him in heavy fetters, none essayed
<lb/>The throne but manifested warm regret.
<lb/>So when the Iranians said to Rustam: <q>Thou
<lb/>Art worthy of the throne,</q><note>Cf. Id. p. 143.</note> he cried against
<lb/>The speaker: <q>Be thy mate the narrow charnel!
<lb/>Shall I be on the throne of gold, the Shah
<lb/>Bound? Perish kingship rather! Perish crown!</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1855"/>
<lb/>He chose out of Iran twelve thousand men,<note>Cf. p. 104 and note.</note>
<lb/>World-taking cavaliers on barded steeds,
<lb/>And freed Kaus and Giv, Gudarz and Tus,
<lb/>From that captivity. Then when Piruz
<lb/>Was slain and for the Iranians all was lost,<note>See Vol. vii, p. 167 seq.</note>
<lb/>While Khushnawaz emboldened by affairs
<lb/>Was seated on the alluring throne in peace,
<lb/>Came Sufrayai, the scion of Karan,
<lb/>In order to restore the throne of power.
<lb/>When his success was manifest the nobles
<lb/>Went from Iran to hail him as their Shah,
<lb/>And make a subject monarch of the earth.
<lb/>He told them: <q>Tis unseemly. Majesty
<lb/>And crown are for the Shah. Although Kubad
<lb/>Is little he will grow; we may not put
<lb/>The wolf within the lion’s wood. To make
<pb n="8.169"/>
<lb/>A Shah without blood royal is to give
<lb/>His kindred to the winds.</q> Now when Kubad
<lb/>Reached manhood he perceived that Sufrayai
<lb/>Deserved the crown and, led by miscreants’ words,
<lb/>Slew him who was the backbone of the state.
<lb/>The folk thereafter put Kubad in fetters,
<lb/>That horseman bold, that hero of the race
<lb/>Of kings, and gave him to Zarmihr, the low-born,
<lb/>That he might take revenge for his own sire.
<lb/>Zarmihr saw none else worthy of the crown
<lb/>And throne of kingship, so he freed Kubad
<lb/>In order that he might assert his claim
<lb/>Without delay. No subject dared aspire
<lb/>Though many were entitled by their birth.
<lb/>When from the Turks one hight 'King Sawa' came
<lb/>To seek the seal and crown the glorious Maker
<lb/>Ordained that he should perish in Iran.
<lb/>Since by God’s Grace and by thy hand so great
<lb/>An action was by thine own thumbstall wrought
<lb/>Thou wouldest have the empire! Know that thou
<lb/>Wilt lose thy life. Yalan-sina curvetteth,
<lb/>Exclaiming: <q>I will set up a new king—
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, offspring of Gashasp—
<lb/>And make my name remembered.</q> Nushirwan,
<lb/>The understanding Shah, found in old age
<lb/>His lost youth in Hurmuzd whom all the magnates
<lb/>Of this our realm support. Support, say I?
<lb/>Are all his bondslaves and his underlings.
<lb/>He hath three hundred thousand cavaliers,
<lb/>All paladins, all famed, and all his slaves,
<lb/>Obedient to his will, yet chose he thee
<lb/>By virtue of his high prerogative,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1856"/>
<lb/>Ennobled all thine ancestors and granted
<lb/>Revenge upon their foes. Wilt thou repay
<lb/>His good with ill? Know ‘twill recoil on thee.
<lb/>Design not evil, brother! It will bring
<pb n="8.170"/>
<lb/>Ill on thine own head. Make not greed the lord
<lb/>O’er wisdom else the sages will not call thee
<lb/>A man of piety. Although a woman,
<lb/>Far younger than my brother, yet I give
<lb/>A man’s advice. Oh! fling not to the wind
<lb/>Thy fathers’ deeds and mayst thou not recall
<lb/>My words to mind.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The assembly marvelled at her,
<lb/>The chieftain bit his lips as well aware
<lb/>That what she said was just and that she sought
<lb/>The path of right. Yalan-sina replied:—
<lb/><q>O noble lady! in this company
<lb/>Forbear to treat of Shahs because Hurmuzd
<lb/>Will soon pass and the paladin enjoy
<lb/>The throne of majesty. Now since the Shah
<lb/>Is what he is in prowess, count thy brother
<lb/>Already as the monarch of Iran,
<lb/>And if Hurmuzd affect<note>Reading with P.</note> the royal crown
<lb/>Why sendeth he a distaff as a gift?
<lb/>The paladin is such a lion-man
<lb/>That at the terror of his sword earth quaketh,
<lb/>And had his sword remained undrawn, Hurmuzd, Iran and Sham had perished, and to send him
<lb/>The present of a distaff and of cotton!
<lb/>Fie on a king so faithless! Talk no more
<lb/>About Turk-born Hurmuzd. May all that race
<lb/>No longer be! To count from Kai Kubad
<lb/>This stock hath had the crown and throne of gold
<lb/>A thousand years. Now it is at an end,
<lb/>So name them not or give Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>A thought; his mention is not worth a mite,
<lb/>And those that are the princes at his court
<lb/>Will be thy brother's subjects who will place
<lb/>At his word their lord’s feet in heavy bonds.</q>
</p><p>


<pb n="8.171"/>
<lb/><q>The Black Div spreadeth out,</q> said Gurdya,
<lb/><q>A net upon thy path. Destroy us<note>Reading with P.</note> not,
<lb/>Both soul and body. I perceive in thee
<lb/>But wind and vapouring. Our sire was marchlord
<lb/>At Rai and thou wouldst have us seek the throne.
<lb/>Now thine incitement of Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And putting into tumult all our kindred,
<lb/>Will give our race’s travail to the wind,
<lb/>And through thy words, thou base-born underling!
<lb/>Yea! lead him on and fill our quiet times
<lb/>With turbulence!</q>
<lb/>She spake and then withdrew
<lb/>In tears with heart grown alien from her brother,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1857"/>
<lb/>While all those present said: <q>This saintly lady,
<lb/>Our eloquent, clear-minded counsellor,
<lb/>Hath spoken, thou wouldst say, just like a book,
<lb/>And is in wisdom greater than Jamasp.</q>
<lb/>Howbeit the thing displeased Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Who was in dudgeon at his sister’s words,
<lb/>And through long musing his distempered heart
<lb/>Showed him the throne of kingship in his dreams.
<lb/>He said: <q>By toil alone aspirants win
<lb/>This fleeting world.</q>
<lb/>He bade to spread the board,
<lb/>And call for wine and harp and minstrelsy,
<lb/>He told the minstrels: <q>Let your song to-day
<lb/>Be of heroic deeds. I will not hear
<lb/>Aught but the story of the Seven Stages;
<lb/>So while we revel sing the part wherein
<lb/>Asfandiyar went to the Brazen Hold,

<lb/>They drank much wine to him and cried: <q>May
<lb/>Rai
<lb/>Be prosperous since such a chief as thou
<pb n="8.172"/>
<lb/>Ariseth thence, and may God fashion more

<lb/>At night they went their several ways;

<p>
<lb/>Whenas the rising sun shot forth its beams,

<lb/>The chief Bahram Chubina, that bold Wolf,
<lb/>Bade the archscribe attend. They wrote the Khan

<lb/>Perfumed<note>Reading with P.</note>, illuminate and illustrate:—
<lb/><q>For grief, while asking pardon for mine acts,
<lb/>My heart is full of sighing and remorse.
<lb/>Henceforth I will not hurt thy country, land,
<lb/>Or marches through regard for thee; and I,
<lb/>If I become the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Will be to thee as ’twere a younger brother.
<lb/>Wash vengeance from thy heart and thou shalt know
<lb/>No difference between Iran and Chin.
<lb/>Take not to heart the past for God forgiveth
<lb/>His slave. A thousand blessings on thy helm,
<lb/>Upon thy sword and thy world-conquering hand.</q>
<lb/>He spake much to the same effect. The envoy
<lb/>Was in amaze at him, then trod earth’s face,
<lb/>And bore the message to the Khan of Chin
<milestone unit="calced" n="1858"/>
<lb/>By whom a gracious answer was returned:—
<lb/><q>I for my part term thee magnanimous.</q>
<pb n="8.173"/>
<lb/>He sent Bahram Chubina gifts that cheered
<lb/>The heart.
<lb/>This matter done, Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Formed other plans, unlocked his hoarded treasures,
<lb/>Gave his troops drachms, steeds, slaves, and privily
<lb/>Aimed at the seat of sovereignty. He chose
<lb/>Among the host a paladin, one fit
<lb/>To be the prince of Khurasan, bestowed
<lb/>That land on him with Nishapur and Balkh,
<lb/>Marv and Herat, and troops withal, then went,
<lb/>From Balkh to Rai, full of solicitude,
<lb/>Upon the glorious Khurdad of Da;
<lb/>Took thought of great and small, then bade his men
<lb/>Set up a mint and issue coins that bore
<lb/>The superscription of Khusrau Parwiz.
<lb/>He gave to merchants shrewd and plausible
<lb/>Of speech, and fitted for the ticklish task,
<lb/>Sacks of these new-coined drachms and said: <q>Buy up
<lb/>Whatever ye can get in Tisfun
<lb/>Of costly Rum brocade with silken figures

<lb/>He meant to bring
<lb/>That coinage to the notice of the king.

<lb/>Bahram Chubina chose a prudent envoy,

<lb/>About Parmida and king Sawa’s host,

<lb/>While thine illustrious, high-fortuned son,
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, is seated on the throne
<lb/>At his command will I make mountains plains,
<lb/>And deserts like Jihun with foemen’s blood.
<lb/>Young though he be still he is fit to rule,
<lb/>And faithful, not a faithless one like thee.
<lb/>I have accepted him as king of kings,

<lb/>His wish was that the king should put to death
<lb/>The son though innocent<note>Couplet omitted.</note> because he feared

<milestone unit="calced" n="1859"/>
<lb/>The fortune-favoured envoy reached Baghdad
<lb/>With men of name from Rai. Hurmuzd grew pale
<lb/>As fenugreek when he received the letter.
<lb/>Anon accounts of that new coinage reached him,
<lb/>Which added grief to grief. He writhed, suspected
<lb/>His son, and spake thus to Ayin Gashasp:—
<lb/><q>Khusrau Parwiz hath grown so bold that he
<lb/>Fain would revolt; moreover he hath struck
<lb/>A brand-new coinage! Could he hold me cheaper?</q>
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp replied: <q>Be courser and charger
<lb/>Ne’er seen without thee. Though Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Is thine own son he should be bound for this.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuzd made answer: <q>Presently will I
<lb/>Remove this upstart.</q>
<lb/>That ambitious lord
<pb n="8.175"/>
<lb/>Thus answered him: <q>May none prevail without thee.</q>
<lb/>They called one privily by night and set him
<lb/>Before the Shah who said: <q>Perform my bidding,
<lb/>And rid earth’s surface of Khusrau Parwiz.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: <q>I will, and charm love from my heart,
<lb/>So let the Shah assign me from his store
<lb/>Bane, and some dark night when Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Is drunken I will drug his wine. This way
<lb/>Is better than to shed his blood.</q>
<lb/>The son,
<lb/>Unwitting that his ruin was proposed,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Sat in his palace gloriously, intent
<lb/>On charming Idols and on pleasant wine,
<lb/>And ignorant of all. A chamberlain
<lb/>Heard of the plot, banned appetite and sleep,
<lb/>Sped to Khusrau Parwiz and made all clear.
<lb/>He, hearing that the monarch of the world
<lb/>Was plotting secretly to slay him, fared
<lb/>From Tisfun by night, and thou hadst said:—
<lb/><q>He vanished from the world.</q> He did not give
<lb/>His priceless head away but reached apace
<lb/>Azar Abadagan. When tidings came
<lb/>To all the chiefs—the marchlords of that province:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1860"/>
<lb/><q>Khusrau Parwiz, aggrieved against the king,
<lb/>Hath fled with some few cavaliers,</q> those magnates
<lb/>Sought for the traces of that well-loved prince;<note>Three couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>All went, both troops and chiefs, to make him Shah.
<lb/>They said: <q>O prince! crown, throne, and helm befit thee,
<pb n="8.176"/>
<lb/>And from Iran and desert of the spearmen,
<lb/>As many of the swordsmen and brave leaders,
<lb/>As thou mayst wish, will come to thee. Thy Grace
<lb/>Will lead the army on. Fear no disaster,
<lb/>But live great, glad, and well beloved.<note>Two couplets omitted.</note> Although
<lb/>Three hundred thousand horsemen of Iran
<lb/>Shall mount the saddle to discomfit thee,
<lb/>We all will give our bodies to be slain
<lb/>For thy sake and will honour those that fall.</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>I fear the Shah and folk, ye chiefs!
<lb/>Unless ye come before Azargashasp,
<lb/>And take great oaths to assure me that henceforth
<lb/>Ye will be loyal to me; then will I
<lb/>Abide here in all confidence and fear
<lb/>Not Ahriman.</q>
<lb/>The warriors, when they heard
<lb/>His words, all set forth for Azargashasp.
<lb/>They took the oath he desired, protesting:—
<lb/><q>We hold thy love as precious as our eyes.</q>
<lb/>Assured about the chiefs he secretly
<lb/>Sent agents everywhere to learn what said
<lb/>His father of his flight and purposed next.
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing that Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Had fled, sent hastily to put Bandwi
<lb/>And Gustaham in bondage as suspects;
<lb/>Both were the uncles of Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Upon the mother’s side and heroes bold.
<lb/>All others of his kin beside these two
<lb/>They also haled to ward without to-do.

<lb/>Then to Ayin Gashasp thus spake the Shah:—
<lb/><q>I lack advice and sorrow is my mate.
<lb/>Now that my son hath gone how shall we treat
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, that slight, self-willed slave?</q>
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp sought an expedient
<lb/>To make his counsel gracious and replied:—
<lb/><q>Exalted Shah! Bahram Chubina oft
<lb/>Hath spoken of me and of all things he
<lb/>Desireth most my blood for I was first
<lb/>To vex him privily, and to dispatch me
<lb/>In fetters to him may prove serviceable.</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>This is not my work,
<lb/>But miscreant Ahriman’s. I will dispatch
<lb/>A host; be thou its leader and prevail;
<lb/>But send him first one of our counsellors
<lb/>To learn his purpose. Fortune, if he seeketh
<lb/>Power, crown, and throne, will turn from him at last,
<lb/>While if he shall remain a loyal liege
<lb/>'Twill be the better for him in the end.
<lb/>Him will I give a portion of the world,
<lb/>And set upon his head the heroes’ crown.
<lb/>The world hath scarcely such a warrior,
<lb/>But, though like Rustam, he is still my thrall.
<lb/>Inform me of his doings every whit;
<lb/>Proceed with diligence; cut short the way.</q>
<lb/>The order given by the prudent Shah
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp obeyed.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="8.178"/>
<lb/>There was a captive,
<lb/>And fellow-citizen of his, within
<lb/>The royal prison, eager for release.
<lb/>On hearing that Ayin Gashasp, the horseman,
<lb/>Was going to the war he sent to say:—
<lb/><q>O battle-loving warrior! I am
<lb/>Thy fellow-citizen and now in prison.
<lb/>Thou art acquainted with my quality.
<lb/>I, if thou wilt but beg me from the king,
<lb/>Will fare with thee on this campaign and risk
<lb/>My life before thee when I am released
<lb/>From this strait prison-house.</q>
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp
<lb/>Thereat sent to the monarch of the world
<lb/>A man in haste to say: <q>There is in bonds
<lb/>A fellow-citizen of mine in fear
<lb/>And peril who will go with me.if now
<lb/>The Shah will grant him pardon for my sake.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1862"/>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>How should this useless wretch
<lb/>Fight in the front of thee? Thou pleadest for
<lb/>A murderer, a scamp, and thief! Dost thou
<lb/>Look for reward? Still I have now no choice
<lb/>Though ’twere the greatest of calamities.</q>
<lb/>He gave Ayin Gashasp that man compact
<lb/>Of ill, that villain, thief, and murderer,
<lb/>And then Ayin Gashasp led forth the host,

<pb n="8.179"/>
<lb/>And marched like wind as far as Hamadan,
<lb/>Where he encamped and asked: <q>Is any one
<lb/>Skilled in astrology or presages
<lb/>Within this noble city?</q>
<lb/>All replied:—
<lb/><q>Our readers of the stars shall come before thee,
<lb/>And earn thy praise.</q>
<lb/>An old, officious townsman
<lb/>Came bustling up and said: <q>There is a dame
<lb/>Both old and rich here, and thou mightest say:—
<lb/><q>She is the stars’ eye.</q> What she saith is so;
<lb/>Her prophecies will surely come to pass.</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="8.180"/>
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp, on hearing this, dispatched
<lb/>One with a horse for her and when she came
<lb/>He asked her how the Shah fared and of him
<lb/>Who led the host, then added: <q>Bring thy lips
<lb/>Close to mine ear and tell me if my soul
<lb/>Will quit my swarthy body in its bed,
<lb/>Or wounded by the weapon of a foe?</q>
<lb/>While thus he spake of secrets to the crone
<lb/>With voice so low that none could overhear them
<lb/>The man for whom he had obtained release,
<lb/>And taken as companion on the journey,
<lb/>Approached and, as he passed by that sage dame,
<lb/>Looked at the general and went his way.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="8.181"/>
<lb/>The ancient dame inquired: <q>What man is that?
<lb/>A blow of his will make one weep for thee.
<lb/>Thy dear life lieth in his hand, and may
<lb/>He perish, skin and marrow!</q>
<lb/>At her words
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp recalled a former presage,
<lb/>Which he had heard from readers of the stars
<lb/>But had forgotten. Thus it ran: <q>Thy fate
<lb/>Shall be in thy companion’s hand—a man
<lb/>Both mean and poor—who will go far with thee,
<lb/>And in return for friendship shed thy blood.</q>
<lb/>He gave her presents and dismissed her quickly,
<lb/>But could not sleep or eat for care. He wrote
<lb/>A letter to the Shah: <q>The man whom I
<lb/>Send back should not have been released for he
<lb/>Is worse than dragon’s spawn, and so the Shah
<lb/>Informed his slave who lacked the imperial Grace.<note>The divine insight pertaining to lawful kingship.</note>

<lb/>When this man cometh bid the ill-disposed<note>The executioner, according to Mohl, but execution sometimes was embittered by being entrusted to the hands of a private enemy.</note>

<lb/>He wrote and set

<lb/>Then said: <q>Convey this letter unperceived

<lb/>Bring his reply to me with all dispatch,
<lb/>And see that thou remain not with the king.</q>
<lb/>The young man took the letter from the chief;
<lb/>His mind was all surmises at that mission,
<lb/>And thus he said: <q>I have endured enough
<lb/>Of prison, heavy bonds, and want of food;
<lb/>But God delivered me from my distress,
<lb/>From grief, affliction, and mine evil fortune;
<lb/>Yet now that I return to Tisfun
<lb/>My blood and marrow seethe.</q>
<lb/>He journeyed sadly
<lb/>Awhile, then broke the letter open, read it,
<lb/>And marvelled at the process of the world.
<lb/>He said: <q>My neighbour begged my life and urged:—
<lb/><q>The act is worthy of the prince,</q> so how
<lb/>Should he be now insistent for my blood
<lb/>Unless some dream hath moved him to this ill?
<lb/>But now to bloodshed he shall see the way,
<lb/>And rest from travail and endeavouring!</q>
<lb/>He turned back musing, went as swift as wind,
<lb/>And on arrival found the chief alone.
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp was seated in his tent,
<lb/>Without attendant, scimitar, and steed
<lb/>Absorbed in thinking on the king and all
<lb/>That fortune might inflict upon himself.
<lb/>Now when his neighbour came within his tent
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp knew that he proposed bloodshed.
<lb/>The murderer drew his scimitar; the chief
<lb/>Implored him much and said: <q>Deluded one!
<lb/>Did not I beg thy lost life from the Shah?</q>
<lb/>The other answered: <q>Granted. What have I
<lb/>Done that thou Shouldst deal ill with me?</q>
<lb/>He smote
<lb/>The noble chief across the neck, determined
<lb/>His fighting and his feasting, and bore off
<lb/>His bloody head unnoticed from the tent.
<lb/>Let him that seeketh honour never be
<lb/>Alone, in war-time more especially.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The miscreant left the murdered in his blood,<note>Or with Mohl: <quote xml:lang="fra">Il sentit que le sang versé le rendait infame.</quote></note>
<lb/>Sped to Bahram Chubina and exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>See thy foe's head — the man's who sought to harm thee!
<lb/>He marched against thee, knowing not thy purpose.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1864"/>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina asked: <q>Who is it? Who
<lb/>Will mourn this head?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>Ayin Gashasp,
<lb/>The cavalier, who left the court for war.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said: <q>The man was good,
<lb/>And he had come from court to reconcile
<lb/>The Shah and us, and thou hast ta'en his head
<lb/>While sleeping! Now will I requite thee so
<lb/>That folk shall sore bewail thee.</q>
<lb/>He bade set
<lb/>A gallows at the door in sight of all,
<lb/>And gibbeted the wretch alive, thus rousing
<lb/>The hearts of evil-doers. Many horsemen
<lb/>Brought by Ayin Gashasp from court sought out
<lb/>Bahram Chubina when their chief had perished,
<lb/>While many others sought Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>And some the Shah. A flock will stray just so
<lb/>Un-herded on a day of wind and snow.

<p><pb n="8.182"/>
<lb/>When tidings reached the king of that famed hero,
<lb/>Ayin Gashasp, he shut the gate of audience
<lb/>For grief; none saw him too with wine in hand;
<lb/>He could not rest or eat or sleep; his eyes
<lb/>Were full of tears. At court the talk ran much
<lb/>Upon the Shah and his secluded state.
<lb/>One said: <q>Bahram Chubina seeketh fight,
<lb/>Desirous of the throne of majesty.</q>
<lb/>Another said: <q>Aggrieved against the Shah
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz is marching on Iran.</q>
<lb/>Confounded at the case the warriors
<lb/>Each held a different view, and as the bruit
<lb/>Arose from Tisfun the monarchy
<lb/>Lost credit while its servants' heads were full
<lb/>Of grief and wrath, preferring curse to blessing.
<lb/>Few troops remained about the gate; the world
<lb/>Grew strait to the Shah’s heart.
<lb/>Then tidings reached
<lb/>Bandwi and Gustaham: <q>The Grace of kingship
<lb/>Is darkened.</q>
<lb/>All the captives loosed their bonds,
<lb/>And sent forth one to ascertain and learn
<lb/>What warriors kept the portal of the Shah,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1865"/>
<lb/>And having learned rebelled, threw off restraint,
<lb/>And broke from ward; shouts rose that shook the plain;
<lb/>The garrison were left remedyless.
<lb/>Appeared Bandwi and Gustaham in mail
<lb/>With troops in arms. The cavaliers forthwith,

<pb n="8.183"/>
<lb/>All unabashed, rode hot-foot to the court,<note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>And gallant Gustaham harangued the troops:—
<lb/><q>This is no trivial case, for if ye join
<lb/>With us ye must ban reverence for the Shah.
<lb/>If ye will all gird up your loins in vengeance
<lb/>For those Iranian chiefs, because Hurmuzd
<lb/>Hath turned upon the innocent, henceforth
<lb/>Hail him not Shah; we will requite his deed,
<lb/>And turn for him the waters of Iran
<lb/>To colocynth. We will direct your course,
<lb/>And set a new Shah on his throne. If ye
<lb/>Show weakness we will leave Iran to you:
<lb/>A corner of the world will do for us,
<lb/>And thither with our comrades will we go.</q>
<lb/>The whole throng at the words of Gustaham
<lb/>Began to curse the Shah’s peace and exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>Down with a king that sheddeth his son's blood!</q>
<lb/>The troops thus heartened fired the palace-gate,
<lb/>Made entry of the imperial hall, and reached
<lb/>The presence of the Shah, that man of Grace.
<lb/>When they had ta'en his crown and flung him headlong
<lb/>Down from his throne they set upon his eyes
<lb/>The searing irons, and the radiant Lamps
<lb/>Were darkened. Then they suffered him to live,
<lb/>And gave his treasure shamefully to spoil.
<lb/>Such are the doings of the exalted sky!
<lb/>Affect not thou this Wayside Hostelry,
<lb/>Wherefrom we have our whiles of wealth and woe,
<lb/>And in the end must quit them both and go.

<lb/>Then Gustaham sent to Azargashasp
<lb/>One with two roadsters to Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>In haste by night with tidings from Iran.
<lb/>The messenger approached the youthful Shah
<lb/>(The moon was one night old) and told what he

<lb/>The young prince paled like flower of fenugreek,
<lb/>And cried: <q>Whoever quitteth wisdom’s ways,

<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> (<name>Chosroes II</name>, A.D. 590-628) was contemporary with three Eastern Roman Emperors—<name>Maurice</name> (A.D.
582-602), <name>Phocas</name> (A.D. 602-610), and <name>Heraclius</name> (A.D. 610-
642). The word <q>Parwiz</q> seems to be a variant of the
Persian word <q><name>Piruz</name></q> which means <q>victorious.</q> Certainly
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> did more to justify such a title than any
Shah since the days of <name>Darius Hystaspis</name>. Egypt and the whole of the Roman possessions in Asia fell into his hands, and Persian troops were encamped within a mile of Constantinople. The genius of <name>Heraclius</name>, however, at length turned the tide. On all these great events the Shahnama is silent and the bulk of the material of the reign is made up from the
Romance of <name>Bahram Chubina</name><note n="1">See p. 72.</note> which leaves his sister, <name>Gurdiya</name>, firmly established in the favour of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> though with <name>Shirin</name> in the neighbourhood it seems doubtful whether she would be allowed to retain her position long.<note n="2">Cf. pp. 364, 389.</note> The reign is the last great one of the poem and towards the end of it

<quote><l>bad begins, and worse remains behind.</l></quote></p>

<p>§ 4. <name>Tabari</name> also states that the meeting between <name>Khusrau
Parwiz</name> and <name>Bahram Chubina</name> took place on the <name>Nahrawdan</name>.<note n="3">NT, pp. 274, 278.</note></p>

<p>§5. The proverb is in the Persian <name>Tabari</name> but is spoken by
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> when about to combat with three Turks.<note n="4">ZT, ii. 292.</note>
See below.</p>

<p>§§ 6-7. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name><note n="5">NT, pp. 274, 280.</note> the three Turks are encountered by <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> after his return from <name>Rum</name>,<note n="6">ZT, ii. p. 291.</note> not as here and in <name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p>§ 8. <quote><l>Thou shalt not kill, but need’st not strive</l>

probably about represents the share of responsibility that
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> had in his father’s murder. <name>Bandwi</name> and
<name>Gustaham</name> were his maternal uncles.</p>

<name>Siyavush</name>, had married <name>Bahram Chubina’s</name> niece.<note n="7">ZT, ii. 283.</note></p>

<p><name>Firdausi</name>’s description of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ place of refuge is somewhat grandiloquent. It appears to have been a hermitage<note n="8">ZT, ii. 280.</note> or monastery.<note n="9">NT, p. 281.</note></p>

<p>Mausil, prince of <place>Mush</place>, was a member of the <name>Mamigonian</name> family, celebrated in Armenian history.<note n="1">NT, p. 285, RSM, 319.</note></p>

<p>§ 13. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, on quitting <place>Ctesiphon</place> in his flight, crossed the <place>Euphrates</place> and went to <place>Ambar</place>, thence followed the course of the stream and recrossing it reached the Roman frontier-station of <place>Circesium</place>.

<p>According to the Persian <name>Tabari</name> the Arab was <name>Ijas</name>, son of

<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> after the execution of <name>Nu’man</name>, the last prince of the dynasty, and commanded the Persians at the battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place>.<note n="4">ZT, ii. pp. 286, 318 seq.</note> The Persian <name>Tabari</name> omits the meeting with the merchant.</p>

<p><name>Karsan</name> looks like a Persian form of <place>Circesium</place> but is a shortened form of <place>Karistan</place>, a busy place. The miracle is not in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p><place>Warigh</place>, as appears from the account in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>,<note n="5">ZT, ii. 288, For Dhu Kar see p. 190.</note> was <place>Rakka</place> (Nicephorium, Callinicus) now in ruins. Some miles to the south-west of it lay the city of <place>Reseph</place> or <place>Rasafa</place>, also now in ruins, in which was the shrine of the celebrated
Saint <name>Sergius</name> who with his consort Saint <name>Bacchus</name> suffered martyrdom under <name>Maximian</name>. The town was in consequence known as <place>Sergiopolis</place>. Either from a genuine but temporary impulse or from policy <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> during his exile in
<place>Rum</place> much affected Christianity, adopted <name>Sergius</name> as his patron
Saint and after recovering his throne still continued to send gifts to, and ask favours of, that shrine. <name>Tabari</name> makes <name>Sergius</name> the leader of the Roman army that effected the restoration of
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>.<note n="6">See NT, p. 284 and note, ZT, ii. 288, GDF, v, 375 and note, RSM,

<p>§17.

<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, but <name>Nöldeke</name> points out that <name>Shirwi</name>'s preeminence at the Persian court is best explained by the assumption that his mother was a princess. <name>Shirin</name>, who naturally was antagonistic to him in the interests of her own son, <name>Mardanshah</name>, was unable to prevail against him.<note n="8">NT, p. 283 note, RSM, P. 504 note.</note></p>

<p>§§ 19-20. These are not in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p>§21. The army lent to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> by the Emperor
was commanded by <name>Narses</name>, a Persian in the Roman service,
an able general who was afterwards cruelly put to death by
<name>Phocas</name>.<note n="9">GDF, p. 373 and note, 391.</note> <name>Nivatis</name> (<name>Theodosius</name>) was the seven years old son,
and so described in the Persian <name>Tabari</name>,<note n="10">ZT, ii. 291.</note> of <name>Maurice</name> and had
already been crowned by the Emperor. He may have accompanied <name>Narses</name>.<note n="11">NT, p. 284 note.</note></p>

<p>§23. The mission of <name>Dara Panah</name> is not in the Persian
<name>Tabari</name>.</p>

<p>§§ 24-26. Historically the events of the campaign seem to
have been briefly as follows: <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> with his Roman
allies marched to the lesser <place>Zab</place> in order to effect a junction
with his native and Armenian supporters with whom were
his two uncles and <name>Mausil</name>. <name>Bahram Chubina</name> vainly tried
to prevent this. He then offered battle with his back to the
<place>Zagros</place> mountains but was compelled to retreat to higher
ground where <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> attacked him against the opinion
of <name>Narses</name>, who, however, with his Roman troops saved the
situation when <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> was in imminent danger of
disaster. This incident appears as the intervention of <name>Surish</name>
in the <title>Shahnama</title>.<note n="1">See p. 299.</note> In the meantime a detachment of the
allied forces had occupied <place>Seleucia</place> and <place>Ctesiphon</place>. The outcome of the situation was that <name>Bahram Chubina</name> retreated
through the mountains in his rear to the neighbourhood of
<place>Takht-i-Sulaiman</place> in order to maintain his communications
with <place>Rai</place> and eastern <place>Iran</place> generally. He was pursued and
after a further retirement was defeated decisively and escaped
with the remnant of his forces by way of <place>Rai</place> and <place>Damghan</place>
to the <orgName>Turks</orgName>.</p>

<p>§27. The Persian <name>Tabari</name> lays the scene with the carline in the neighbourhood of <place>Hamadan</place>. Thence <name>Bahram Chubina</name> proceeds to <place>Rai</place> and <place>Damghan</place>. He then defeats a mountain-chief named <name>Keran</name> and takes him prisoner but releases him.<note n="2">ZT, ii. p. 296 seq.</note></p>

<p>§31. The death of <name>Firdausi</name>’s son took place apparently about A.D. 1004.</p>

<p>§ 32. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> the name of the chief that domineered over the <name>Khan</name> was <name>Paighi</name>—the word used for the races of the north in <name>Daqiqi</name>'s portion of the <title>Shahnama</title>.<note n="4">Vol. v. p. 21 and note.</note> He was the <name>Khan</name>'s brother and claimed to have a better title to the throne.<note n="5">ZT, i. 302.</note></p>

<p>§ 34. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> it is a bear that carries off
the <name>Khan</name>’s daughter and <name>Bahram Chubina</name> rescues her.<note n="6">ZT, i. 302.</note></p>

<p>§37. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> the queen is concerned directly in the murder of <name>Bahram Chubina</name>. She is heavily bribed and provides the assassin.<note n="7">ZT, i. 303.</note> So too in <name>Tabari</name>.<note n="8">NT, p. 289.</note></p>

<p>§ 39. The crafty <name>Kharrad</name>, son of <name>Barzin</name>, as <name>Firdausi</name> calls him, but whose real name was <name>Hurmuzd Garabzin</name> or <name>Galabzin</name>, may be identical with the chief who commanded one of the
Persian wings at the battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place><note>See below.</note> and was killed,<note n="9">NT, pp. 289 and note, 335 note, 338, 341, 342.</note> but according to the <title>Shahnama</title> he was alive at the accession of
<name>Kubad</name> (<name>Shirwi</name>).</p>

<p>The battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place>, though the forces engaged in it do not appear to have been large, was a very memorable affair.
The events that led up to it are given at length in <name>Tabari</name>. It will be sufficient to say here that a long series of intrigues resulted in the execution of <name>Nu’man bin Munzir</name> by order of
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>. This ended the dynasty of the princes of
<place>Hira</place>, and <name>Ijas bin Kabisa</name><note>Cf. p. 188.</note> was appointed the Persian governor by the Shah who ordered him to collect and dispatch to the
Persian court all <name>Nu’man</name>’s effects. The Arab chief, <name>Hani bin Mas’ud</name>, who had been entrusted with them refused to give them up. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> instructed <name>Ijas</name> to enforce compliance, and the battle of <place>Dhu Kar</place>, in which the Persians were overthrown, followed. Where <place>Dhu Kar</place> was is not clear but it was not far from the <place>Euphrates</place> and <place>Kufa</place>, and had an all the year round water-supply which made it a great resort of the Arab tribes in the summer at which season the battle was fought. The Arabs celebrated their victory with songs of triumph, and its results and those of the Persian policy that

<pb n="8.191"/>
led up to it were very important. The destruction of the dynasty of the princes of <place>Hira</place>, which had formed a buffer state between the Persians and the Arabs, was a political blunder. The defeat was a display of weakness on the part of the Persians in a region at no great distance from their own capital. It gave the Arabs independence, encouraged them to make raids into Persian territory, and was a glorious and stimulating memory with which tradition soon associated
<name>Muhammad</name> himself when the time came for the great Arab invasion of <place>Iran</place>. For these reasons the battle called for some notice here although there is no mention of it in the <title>Shahnama</title>.
It was fought some time between A.D. 604-610.<note>See for the above generally NT, p. 310 seq. and notes, ZT, ii. 309 seq.</note></p>

<p>§§ 40-42. According to <name>Tabari</name> the <name>Khan</name> wished to marry
<name>Gurdiya</name> to his brother who pursues and is killed by her.<note n="1">NT, p. 289.</note>
</p>

<p>
§§ 44-47. On these see NT, p. 478 seq. The story of the revolt of <name>Gustaham</name> seems only to be known from various versions of the Romance of <name>Bahram Chubina</name>. <name>Bandwi</name> appears to have been killed early in the reign about the year
A.D. 591. <name>Gustaham</name> rebelled shortly afterwards and held out till about A.D. 595.</p>

<p>§ 52. <name>Shirwi</name> seems to have been <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ eldest son but who his real mother was is unknown.<note>Cf. p. 188.</note> His troubles with his father sprang from <name>Shirin</name>’s ambition on behalf of her own son, <name>Mardanshah</name>.<note>NT, p. 357, note.</note></p>

<p>§§ 53-54. According to the <title>Shahnama</title> the Cross had been long indeed in the possession of the Persians. Here the carrying off is attributed to <name>Ardshir</name> not <name>Darab</name>.<note>Vol. v. p. 306, and note.</note> Historically they took it when they captured <place>Jerusalem</place> in A.D. 614.<note>NT, p. 291 note.</note> It was given back as one of the terms of peace between <name>Heraclius</name> and <name>Kubad</name> (<name>Shirwi</name>) in A.D. 628.
</p>

The statement that <name>Jesus</name> laughed upon the Cross is a corollary from the notion, common among the Gnostics, that he was not really crucified but someone in his stead. The more accurate form of the statement would be that quoted in <name>Photius</name> from a work called <q>The Journeys (or Circuits) of the Apostles</q> (<title xml:lang="grc">Ἀποστόλων Περίοδοι</title>) viz. that <name>Christ</name> was not crucified but another in his place, and that therefore he laughed at the crucifiers (<quote xml:lang="grc">τὸν Χριστὸν μὴ σταυρωθῆναι ἀλλ᾽ ἕτερον ἀντ᾽ αὐτῶν, καί
καταγελᾷν διὰ τόυτο τῶν σταυρούντων</quote>),<note>DBP, cod. 114.</note> <name>Muhammad</name> in the <name>Kuran</name>

adopted this view which of course became the belief of his followers: <quote>They slew him not, and they crucified him not, but it was made to appear so to them.</quote><note>RK, p. 551 and note. Cf. SK, l. 62 and notes, 116 and notes.</note></p>

<p>§56. <name>Shirin</name> has been described by different authorities as of <place>Roman</place>, <place>Greek</place>, <place>Armenian</place>, and <place>Persian</place> descent. She has been identified also with <name>Maryam</name>, the problematical wife of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>—a view that receives no support from the <title>Shahnama</title>. There is a general agreement that she was a Christian.<note>Cf. p. 195.</note> According to the <title>Shahnama</title> the association of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> with <name>Shirin</name> began during his father’s lifetime.
This is affirmed also in some accounts quoted by <name>Mir Khand</name> according to which <name>Shirin</name> was in the service of a Persian noble at whose house <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> in his youth occasionally visited. There he saw <name>Shirin</name>, fell in love with her, and gave her a ring. The noble got to know of what was going on and ordered a servant to drown her. She saved herself, however, with the servant’s connivance and took refuge with a hermit.
After <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> became Shah she got the ring conveyed to him, and he carried her off to <place>Mada’in</place> in great state.<note>RM, Pt. 1. Vol. ii. p. 399.</note> If
<name>Shirin</name> really managed to retain her influence over <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> for the best part of a lifetime, she must have been possessed of a very exceptional personality. The devotion to her of her lover, <name>Farhad</name>, is celebrated in <name>Nizami</name>’s poem of
<q><title>Khusrau and Shirin</title></q> (A.D. 1180). <name>Farhad</name>, famous for his architectural and engineering skill, seems to be an historical character. To him with some probability may be attributed the responsibility for <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ triumphal arch at <place>Takht-i-Bustan</place> near <place>Kirmanshah</place> and his palace at <place>Mashita</place>
(<place>Mashetta</place>) some twenty-five miles due east of the northern end of the Dead Sea. The date of the construction of this palace, of which the exquisitely carved stone facade is now in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin, however, is still disputed.<note>A general view of the ruins, as they were, and a detail of the ornamentation, are given in RSM, p. 594 seq.</note> <name>Farhad</name> is not mentioned in the <title>Shahnama</title>. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name>, <name>Shirin</name> is stated to have been a Greek, to have predeceased <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, and to have been loved by <name>Farhad</name>, but it is not said that she was in love with him.<note>ZT, ii. 304.</note>

origin, and she is said to have been a native of <place>Khuzistan</place>.<note>NT, p. 283 note.</note>
</p><p>
Her name is derived from the Persian word for milk, <q>shir,</q> and so comes to mean <q>sweet.</q></p>

<name>Amasis</name> by <name>Herodotus</name>.<note n="1">RH, Bk. ii, ch. 172.</note></p>

<p>§ 58. The murder of <name>Maryam</name> by <name>Shirin</name> is on the face of it
a poetical fiction suggested by the known enmity felt by <name>Shirin</name> with regard to <name>Shirwi</name> who, as a parricide to be, is here represented in an unfavourable light. His imprisonment probably was brought about by <name>Shirin</name> in the interests of her own son
<name>Mardanshah</name> and nearly had the effect desired.<note n="2">ZT, ii. 305.</note></p>

<p>§60. In the Persian <name>Tabari</name> <name>Sarkash</name> is called <name>Sergius</name>.<note n="3">For an illustration of the ruins see RSM, frontispiece.</note></p>

<p>§61. The palace here referred to must be the <place>Takht-i-
Khusrau</place> whose façade and vast hall on the left bank of the
<place>Tigris</place> some twenty-five miles below <place>Baghdad</place> form the finest remains of <orgName>Sasanian</orgName> architecture. The palace, however, seems to have been built not in the days of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> but in those of his grandfather <name>Nushirwan</name> and, as <name>Firdausi</name> states, a Roman architect may have been employed. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> from about the time of the outbreak of the Roman war
(A.D. 603), after the murder of the Emperor <name>Maurice</name> by <name>Phocas</name> till nearly the end of his reign, held his court at <place>Dastagird</place> not at <place>Ctesiphon</place>.<note n="4">See p. 194.</note></p>

<p>§§ 63-65. The reign of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> bears a considerable resemblance to that of <name>Assurbanipal</name> (B.C. 668-626). Their seats of government were on the same historic stream—<place>Dastagird</place> and <place>Mada’in</place> in the former case, <place>Nineveh</place> and <place>Calah</place> in the latter. Both reigns were long and the last great ones of their respective dynasties. The wars of both monarchs covered much the same ground—<place>Syria</place>, <place>Armenia</place>, <place>Asia Minor</place>, and <place>Egypt</place>. In both cases a season of military brilliancy and territorial expansion was followed by one of cumulative disaster. In both cases the national resources were over-strained and in both cases the subsequent collapse came with startling suddenness.
</p>
<p>The account given by <name>Firdausi</name> of the causes that led to the fall of <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> and of the fall itself may be amplified from other authorities thus:—In A.D. 626 the <orgName>Sasanian Empire</orgName>, though it had suffered shrewd blows in the previous

<pb n="8.194"/> 
campaigns of <name>Heraclius</name>, was still after nearly a quarter of a century of warfare far from being worsted. It was not <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> but <name>Heraclius</name> that made several vain attempts to bring about peace. The Persian army under <name>Shahrbaraz</name>
(the <name>Gurdz</name> of <name>Firdausi</name>) still occupied <place>Chalcedon</place>, divided only by a mile, but an impassable mile, of sea from <place>Constantinople</place>.
The Persians had good cause to deplore their lack of sea-power.
To get over this difficulty they made arrangements for a mixed horde of <orgName>Avars</orgName>, <orgName>Slavs</orgName>, and other tribes, who had no straits to cross, to attack <place>Constantinople</place>. That city was besieged accordingly but proved impregnable to the resources of the barbarians. <name>Heraclius</name>, meanwhile, contented himself with operations in <place>Lazica</place> but his brother, <name>Theodore</name>, worsted the
Persians in <place>Asia Minor</place>. In this connexion we have an instance of the way in which <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> treated his unsuccessful generals. The defeat of the Persians on the occasion in question seems largely to have been due to the effects of a severe hail-storm. <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, however, was very wroth and when the Persian commander died of despondency shortly afterwards he had the body embalmed and sent to him to be maltreated.<note n="1">CTC, Vol.i. p. 485.</note> In A.D. 627 <name>Heraclius</name> determined on a Winter campaign against his enemy’s capital. He defeated the
Persians near <place>Nineveh</place> on December 12th and then marched on
<place>Dastagird</place>, some seventy miles above <place>Ctesiphon</place>, where <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>
had held his court for the previous twenty years in consequence, it is said, of a prediction made to him when besieging <place>Dara</place> in the days of the Emperor <name>Phocas</name> that he would perish on the next occasion that he entered <place>Ctesiphon</place>.<note n="2">CTC, Vol.i. p. 494, 496.</note>
Nevertheless, he retreated thither, abandoning <place>Dastagird</place> to its fate, and then crossed the <place>Tigris</place> to <place>Bih-Ardshir</place> (Seleucia), taking with him <name>Shirin</name>, two sons of his by her, and three daughter-wives.<note n="3">CTC, Vol.i. p. 496, 499.</note> His eldest son, <name>Shirwi</name>, and his other sons were in internment at <place>Akr Babil</place>, a state-prison near <place>Babylon</place>.<note n="4">NT, p. 356 and note.</note>
At <place>Bih-Ardshir</place> the Shah armed his personal attendants etc. and sent them to reinforce the defeated Persian army which had made no effective stand since the battle of <place>Nineveh</place>. These combined forces, with two hundred elephants, took up their position on the river <place>Arba</place>, a short distance from <place>Ctesiphon</place> and broke down the bridges.<note n="5">CTC, p. 498.</note> On January 11th A.D. 628
<name>Heraclius</name> advanced from <place>Dastagird</place>, which he had devastated,

<pb n="8.195"/> 
and three days later encamped within twelve miles of the <place>Arba</place>.
He sent <name>George</name>, the leader of the Armenian contingent, to reconnoitre the Persian position and on his report retreated northwards to the neighbourhood of <place>Lake Urumiah</place> where he passed the rest of the Winter. Shortly before he had made another of his appeals to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> for an accommodation: <q>I follow thee and am instant for peace, for I do not of mine own will consume Persia with fire but because I am forced thereto by thee. Now therefore let us throw down our arms and welcome peace. Let us put out the fire before all is burned.</q> The Shah refused the offer to the exasperation of his people<note n="6">CTC, p. 498.</note> with whom he was already very unpopular because, according to <name>Tabari</name>, he despised them and treated their great men without regard, had given the barbarian <name>Farrukhanzad</name>, son of <name>Sumai</name>, power over them, and ordered the execution of the captives, and intended to put to death the
Persian troops defeated by <name>Heraclius</name>.<note n="7">NT, p. 356. The prisoners are said to have numbered 36,000.</note> He had also, it seems, sent instructions for the putting to death of the Persian general
<name>Shahrbaraz</name>, but the bearer of the letter was taken by the
Romans. <name>Heraclius</name> informed <name>Shahrbaraz</name> who falsified the letter by making the order apply to forty other chiefs as well as to himself and read out the dispatch as altered to the assembled Persian leaders. In their wrath they renounced their allegiance to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>, made terms of peace with
<name>Heraclius</name>, and decided to quit <place>Chalcedon</place> and return home.<note n="8">CTC, i. 497.</note>
<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> also had managed to offend his native Christian subjects. In earlier days he had been disposed favourably towards them, and we have seen how he placed himself under the special protection of S. <name>Sergius</name>,<note n="9">p. 188.</note> while his wife, <name>Shirin</name>, was a Christian of the <orgName>Nestorian</orgName> persuasion. She was, however, lured over to the <orgName>Monophysites</orgName> and used her influence against the <orgName>Nestorians</orgName> who in consequence were not allowed to choose a <title>Catholicus</title>. A very highly esteemed <orgName>Nestorian</orgName> named <name>Yazdin</name> was chief tax-collector. After his death <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> seized his property and did not bestow by way of compensation the vacant post on <name>Yazdin</name>’s son, <name>Shamta</name>, who also was a <orgName>Nestorian</orgName> and afterwards took a prominent part in the revolt against the Shah. Towards the end of the reign the <orgName>Monophysites</orgName> also had cause for complaint against

<pb n="8.196"/>

<name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>. Generally speaking, too, all Christians must have been horrified at the sack of <place>Jerusalem</place> and the carrying off of the True Cross.<note>See for the above NT, pp. 357, 383 and notes.</note> There was therefore no lack of discontent throughout the army and nation generally. The retreat of <name>Heraclius</name>, however, at a moment when the state seemed threatened with imminent peril, might have staved off matters for a while had it not been for the question of the succession. It is said that <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> when he fled from
<place>Dastagird</place> to <place>Ctesiphon</place> was suffering from dysentery and wished to secure the crown for his son <name>Mardanshah</name>, the offspring of <name>Shirin</name>.<note>CTC. 1. 499.</note> <name>Shirwi</name>, the Shah’s eldest son, who
was in internment with many of his brothers, was therefore in a situation of imminent peril. A conspiracy was formed to make him Shah and rescue the captives in the prisons. Among the conspirators were two sons of <name>Shahrbaraz</name>, <name>Shamta</name>, son of
<name>Yazdin</name>, and <name>Mihr Hurmuzad</name>, the son of a former governor of
<place>Nimruz</place> who had fallen a victim to <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name>’ jealous suspicions.<note>NT, p. 379 and note. <name>Nöldeke</name> does not consider the execution of the governor historical.</note> A party of the nobles hastened to ’Akr Babil and brought <name>Shirwi</name> by night to <place>Bih-Ardshir</place> (Seleucia) where, at the bridge of boats, which it would be important to seize, he was met by others of the conspirators. The prisons were thrown open, and that night <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> heard the shouts that hailed <name>Shirwi</name> as <q><name>Kubad</name> Shahanshah.</q> When the rebels approached the palace in the early morning the royal bodyguard fled and <name>Khusrau Parwiz</name> escaped into his garden which was called <q>The Garden of the Indians</q> but was discovered shortly and taken prisoner. The date, according to our reckoning, was February 25th, A.D. 628.<note>NT, p. 356.</note></p>

<p>
<lb/>Whenas Khusrau Parwiz sat on the throne
<lb/>Of gold the men of noble birth repaired
<lb/>To him. They summoned all the chiefs and showered
<lb/>Gems over that new crown. He thus addressed
<lb/>The archmages: <q>No one save the fortunate</q>
<lb/><q>Can win this crown and throne. May mine employ</q>
<lb/><q>Be right alone for from injustice cometh</q>
<lb/><q>All loss. ‘We purpose well to all. Our head</q>

<p>
<lb/>Now when the ebon Veil had disappeared,
<lb/>And in the distance cock-crow reached the ear,
<lb/>The winner of the world with stricken heart,
<lb/>And deeply sorrowful, approached his sire,
<lb/>On seeing him lamented, did obeisance,
<lb/>And tarried long with him. Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>Beholding his sire’s face, sighed deeply, kissed
<lb/>His eyes and head and feet, then said to him
<lb/>With full heart and with face all wet with tears:—
<lb/><q>My father, fortune’s mate, thou memory
<lb/>Of Nushirwan! thou know’st that none had pricked
<pb n="8.199"/>
<lb/>Thy finger had I been but there to help thee.
<lb/>See what thou wilt command me; grief hath come
<lb/>Upon thee and my heart is full. If now
<lb/>Thou biddest I am at thy gate a slave
<lb/>To guard thy head. I seek not crown, I want
<lb/>Not host, and lay my head before thy throne.</q>
<lb/>Hurmuzd replied: <q>O prudent one! my day
<lb/>Of misery will pass from me, and he
<lb/>That perpetrated this will soon be gone:
<lb/>Both trouble and delight are transient.
<lb/>I ask three things of thee, no more, and one
<lb/>Is that each morning at the break of day
<lb/>Thou wilt delight mine ears with thine own voice;
<lb/>The second is that thou wilt send to me
<lb/>Some noble cavalier scarred with long fight
<lb/>To talk to me of warfare and the chase,
<lb/>And some old sage to hold discourse of kings,
<lb/>And bring to me the records to abate
<lb/>My pain and misery; and my third wish
<lb/>Is that thy mother’s brothers, who are not
<lb/>Thine equals but thy slaves, shall never see
<lb/>The world henceforth: discharge thy wrath on them
<lb/>For all this grief.</q>
<lb/><q>O king!</q> he made reply,
<lb/><q>May that man perish who deploreth not
<lb/>Thine eyes and be thy foes, though their ill deeds
<lb/>Be secret, banished from the world, but still
<lb/>Consider in that lucid mind of thine:
<lb/>Bahram Chubina hath been paladin
<lb/>While with him there are countless forces—horsemen
<lb/>And gallant sworders—and if we lay hand
<lb/>On Gustaham no refuge will be left us;</q>

<q><lb/>And hold not thou the action Gustaham’s;

<lb/>He spake,
<lb/>And left the presence weeping but reserved.
<lb/>The son was kindlier-tempered than the king
<lb/>In which regard a man of wisdom said:—

<lb/>To his bright eyes, and those two Lamps, those twin

<lb/>By daring I will seize the world.</q>
<lb/>He bade
<lb/>To bear forth to the field the kettledrums
<lb/>And flag of majesty. He packed the baggage,
<lb/>He called his warriors to horse and spake
<lb/>Of waging war against Khusrau Parwiz.
<lb/>His host, as 'twere a moving mountain, marched
<lb/>Audaciously as far as Nahrawan.
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1870"/>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, on hearing, was in dudgeon
<lb/>At such swift action and sent spies to note
<lb/>The progress of events with these behests:—
<q><lb/>We first must learn the feeling of his troops:
<lb/>If like Bahram Chubina they intend
<lb/>To fight or whether we shall have delay,
<lb/>And whether he be foremost at the centre
<lb/>Or at the wings, his state at audience-time,
<lb/>And if he hunteth while upon the march.</q>
<lb/>They went unnoted by the troops, gat news,
<lb/>And came back to the Shah all privily.
<lb/>They said: <q>His troops are for Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>All from the highest chieftains to the boys.
<lb/>In marching he is sometimes at the centre,
<lb/>And sometimes with the right or left or baggage.
<lb/>We saw him long of sight and diligent—
<lb/>A cautious warrior and cavalier.
<lb/>His kinsmen all are in his confidence;
<lb/>He hath no need of strangers, giveth audience
<lb/>In royal fashion, hunteth on the plain
<lb/>With cheetahs, knoweth but the usages

<pb n="8.202"/>

<lb/>Of Shahs, and readeth all the book of Dimna.<note>The Fables of Bidpai. See Vol. vii. p. 382.</note></q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz said to his minister:—
<q><lb/>A long task faceth us. Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>When he is charging at an enemy,
<lb/>Would break the hearts of dragons in the deep,
<lb/>And from the monarch of the world withal
<lb/>Hath learned the methods of the kings of kings,
<lb/>While, thirdly, with Kalila, <note>The Fables of Bidpai. See Vol. vii. p. 382.</note>so to speak,
<lb/>As minister none hath so shrewd a scribe.</q>
<lb/>Then said he to Bandwi and Gustaham:—
<q><lb/>Our mates are grief and toil.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Gurdwi,
<lb/>Darman, the monarch of Armenia,
<lb/>Shapur and Andaman, shrewd chiefs and fighters,
<lb/>Were set in secret conclave with the Shah
<lb/>He thus addressed them: <q>Mighty warriors!
<lb/>When wisdom is a light within the brain
<lb/>Then knowledge is the body’s coat of mail,
<lb/>Which naught except the sword of death will sever,
<lb/>A sword whereto a steel helm is as wax.
<lb/>I am but young to you so cannot walk
<lb/>The world aright; instruct me what to do.
<lb/>Who suffereth from these wounds?</q>
<lb/>An archmage said:—
<q><lb/>Thou wilt be happy and the Grace and provand

</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1871"/>

<p>
<q><lb/>Of empty brains. Now since the mystery
<lb/>Of this our whirling world grew manifest
<lb/>Hath wisdom been disparted into four.
<lb/>One portion is the king’s for Grace and wisdom
<lb/>Fit him; another is the pious man’s;
<lb/>The third the loyal hege’s who as near
<lb/>The royal person tendereth advice;
<lb/>The wise account the small part left the thane’s.
<lb/>The impious and unthankful have no wisdom.
<lb/>If now the king will hear the old sage’s words,

<pb n="8.203"/>
<lb/>And fix his heart’s eye on them, he will eat
<lb/>Their fruit when they have passed within his heart.</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Were I to write this down
<lb/>In gold its Grace and vogue would ask no less;
<lb/>The archimages’ utterances are gems,
<lb/>But I have other purposes at heart,
<lb/>For when our two hosts meet, and when our spearheads
<lb/>Shall reach to Gemini, I shall not be
<lb/>Blamed if I quit the centre and advancing

<lb/>That impious and self-seeking general,
<lb/>Show him a peaceful face, make much of him,
<lb/>And praise him. If he shall receive my words

<lb/>Tis well, for who at court can be his peer?
<lb/>But if he seeketh fight I too will fight,
<lb/>And range my host against his.</q>
<lb/>All the leaders
<lb/>Assented to his scheme, the great applauded,
<lb/>And hailed him king of earth; all said: <q>Oh! be
<lb/>The ills of fortune far from thee, O king!
<lb/>Be victory, Grace, majesty, and crown
<lb/>Of king of kings thine own.</q>
<lb/>He answered thus:—
<q><lb/>So be it; enough. May none of us behold
<lb/>Disunion or defeat.</q>
<lb/>Then from Baghdad,
<lb/>And with new camp-enclosures, he marched forth
<lb/>Upon the plain. As the two powers drew near
<lb/>Upon the march, the captain of the host’s
<lb/>On that side and on this the Shah's, and when
<lb/>The world’s light had been taken in the toils,
<lb/>And pitchy night had shaken out its locks,
<lb/>Scouts went forth from both hosts to guard the approaches;
<lb/>And when night, frighted by the sword of day
<lb/>Had fled dry-lipped and quaking, rose the din

<pb n="8.204"/>

<lb/>Of tymbals from both camps and Sol led forth
<lb/>To war. Then at the Shah’s command Bandwi
<lb/>And Gustaham put on their iron helms,
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1872"/>
<p>
<lb/>And went with other chiefs of ardent soul
<lb/>Toward the canal <note><gloss>Spring</gloss> in the original.</note> of Nahrawan, whereat
<lb/>The outpost came before Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is a force two bowshots off.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this he ranged his host and called
<lb/>His veterans and bestrode a piebald steed
<lb/>With musk-black tail—a noble caracoller
<lb/>With brazen hoofs. An Indian scimitar
<lb/>Sufficed to arm him, and its stroke was like
<lb/>The levin from the cloud. He urged his horse
<lb/>As ’twere a lightning-flash. That miscreant,
<lb/>Izid Gashasp, was on his left. Withal
<lb/>There came Hamdan Gashasp <note>Reading with P.</note> and Yalan-sina,
<lb/>All rage and enmity, while three bold Turks,
<lb/>Sprung from the Khan, made ready to take vengeance
<lb/>Upon Khusrau Parwiz and swore: <q>When we
<lb/>Shall see the Shah out-distancing his troops,
<lb/>Him will we bring to thee in bonds or slain,
<lb/>And thy realm shall repose in peace.</q>
<lb/>On one side
<lb/>There was Khusrau Parwiz and on the other
<lb/>The paladin, between was Nahrawan,
<lb/>While on both sides the armies watched them meet,
<lb/>And how the paladin the Shah would greet.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How Khusrau Parwiz and Bahram Chubina met and parleyed</head>

<p>

<lb/>Bahram Chubina and Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Thus met, one cheerful and the other grim.


<pb n="8.205"/>

<lb/>The world-lord rode an ivory grey and wore
<lb/>A gold and jewelled crown; his robe from Chin
<lb/>Was of brocade of gold. Gurdwi as guide 
<lb/>Preceded him, Bandwi and Gustaham
<lb/>Were at his side, and therewithal Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, who wore a helm of gold.
<lb/>They all were clad in iron, gold, and silver 
<lb/>Their golden girdles were occult with gems.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina paled with rage on seeing
<lb/>The king of kings and thus addressed his chiefs :—
<lb/><q>This whoreson miscreant from low estate
<lb/>And boorish manner hath attained to manhood,
<lb/>Grown powerful and girt himself for action.
<lb/>The writing of the down is manifest
<lb/>Upon the ivory rondure of his face ;
<lb/>So now he hath become Shah Faridun
<lb/>With mace and crown and caught the imperial style,
<lb/>But speedily will this world end for him.
<lb/>This dark-souled bastard leadeth on his troops
<lb/>Like Nushirwan. Scan thoroughly his host
<lb/>To see if there be of it one of name.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1873"/>
<lb/>I cannot spy one warlike cavalier 
<lb/>That could confront me for a single breath.
<lb/>Now shall he look upon the deeds of men,
<lb/>Steeds charging, scimitars, the dust of war,
<lb/>The clash of battle-axes, showers of arrows,
<lb/>The heroes’ shouts, the captives, give and take.
<lb/>The elephants are driven from the field
<lb/>When I march forth to battle. At our voice
<lb/>The mountains melt and warriors lose their prowess.
<lb/>I take the rivers with my sword and turn
<lb/>Their waters into blood.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake and spurred
<lb/>His pied steed, thou hadst said: <q>His flying eagle.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He chose himself a narrow battlefield,
<lb/>The troops in wonder watching him, and thence

<pb n="8.206"/>

<lb/>Went on to Nahrawan and there confronted
<lb/>The glorious Great with certain of Iran,
<lb/>Armed for the conflict with Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>Who said: <q>O noble chiefs! who recogniseth
<lb/>Bahram Chiubina ?</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Gurdwi: <q>O king!
<lb/>Observe the warrior on the piebald steed,
<lb/>With white juppon, black baldrick, and who rideth
<lb/>About among the troops.</q></p>

<p>He recognised
<lb/>The man at sight and said: <q>Yon lengthy one,
<lb/>Smoke-hued and riding on the noble piebald ? </q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Gurdwi replied: <q>The same and bent on ill.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><q>If thou shouldst question,</q> said Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/><q>That crook-back he would answer churlishly ;
<lb/>With that hooked nose and half shut eyes <q>he hath,</q>
<lb/>Thou wouldest say, <q>a wrathful heart.</q> Thou seest
<lb/>That he is wicked by his looks, God’s foe.
<lb/>I mark naught of submission in his head,
<lb/>And that none will command him.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>To Bandwi
<lb/>And Gustaham he said thereafter: <q>I
<lb/>Will give an illustration of this saw :—
<lb/><q>If ‘neath the load the donkey will not pass
<lb/>Then take the weighty burden to the ass.</q>
<lb/>If some bold div hath gulled Bahram Chtbina
<lb/>How should he see God’s way ? All hearts that ache
<lb/>With greed are helped not by the advice of wisdom.
<lb/>When thou goest forth to war debate is over.
<lb/>We must consider all from first to last :
<lb/>Who knoweth which will conquer in the fight,
<lb/>Which host be doleful or illustrious ?
<lb/>Considering those troops so well arrayed,
<lb/>And with a leader eager for the fray,
<lb/>Such as Bahram Chubina is—a man
<lb/>Grim as a lusty div—and militants
<pb n="8.207"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1874"/>
<lb/>Like ravening wolves, I will, with your consent,
<lb/>So that disgrace may not attach to me,
<lb/>Be first to make advances; ’twill be better
<lb/>For me than showing slackness in the fight.
<lb/>If I receive from him a fair reply
<lb/>His late misdoings shall be obsolete ;
<lb/>I will bestow some corner of the world
<lb/>Upon him and by bounty earn his thanks ;
<lb/>Our warfare and endeavours in the field
<lb/>Shall end in peace—a gain to us. No doubt
<lb/>The wisest course is safest. Good folk joy
<lb/>When monarchs act as merchants do.</q>
</p><p>





<lb/><q>O king!</q>
<lb/>Said Gustaham, <q>live happily while time
<lb/>Shall last. Thou scatterest gems in talk and art
<lb/>More wise. Do what thou willest. Thou art just,
<lb/>And yon slave is unjust; thy head is full
<lb/>Of brains and his of wind.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>On hearing this, advanced before his troops,
<lb/>Held distant parle with brave Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And sought for feast in war-time. Thus he said:—
<lb/><q>Illustrious man! what business hast thou here
<lb/>Upon the battlefield? Thou art as though
<lb/>The jewel of the court, the wealth of throne
<lb/>And diadem, the army’s prop in war-time,
<lb/>And as a bright light at our festivals.
<lb/>Thou art ambitious, brave, and servest God;
<lb/>Ne’er may the Almighty take His hand from thee.
<lb/>I have considered of thy case, approved
<lb/>Thine acts, will entertain thee and thy troops,
<lb/>And make my soul glad by the sight of thee.
<lb/>I will appoint thee general of Iran,
<lb/>As is but right, and I will pray to God
<lb/>For thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When brave Bahram Chubina heard

<pb n="8.208"/>

<lb/>He gave his black-tailed, piebald steed the rein,
<lb/>Saluted from his seat, paused, and replied:—
<lb/><q>In good case, blithe, and fortunate am I,
<lb/>And may the day of greatness ne’er be thine,
<lb/>Who knowest not kingship whether just or not.
<lb/>The Alans’ king in the conduct of his kingship
<lb/>Is being helped by the unfortunate!
<lb/>I have considered of thy case and suppled
<lb/>A lasso for thy sake. I will erect
<lb/>Forthwith a lofty gibbet, make thy hands
<lb/>Fast in the coils, and hang thee up thereon
<lb/>As thou deservest, giving thee a glimpse
<lb/>Of fortune’s bitterness.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Heard and his cheeks became like fenugreek.
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1875"/>
<p>
<lb/>He knew: <q>Bahram Chubina will not yield,
<lb/>And part with crown and throne,</q> and thus replied:—
<lb/><q>Ingrate! No good man would speak thus. When guests
<lb/>Come to thy house from far dost thou revile them
<lb/>At feasting-time? This note is not the wont
<lb/>Of Shahs or of the exalted cavaliers.
<lb/>No Arab and no Persian e’er have acted
<lb/>Like this in thirty centuries. The wise
<lb/>Would shame hereat, so go not thou about
<lb/>The door of thanklessness. When guests give thee
<lb/>A glorious greeting one must be a div
<lb/>To answer as thou dost. Ill days, I fear,
<lb/>Await thee for thou knowest that thy counsels
<lb/>Are troubled. Thy resource is in the hands
<lb/>Of that Great King who liveth ever more,
<lb/>Whose word is law. Thou sinnest in His sight,
<lb/>And art ingrate, with person in disgrace,
<lb/>And heart in fear. In calling me the king
<lb/>Of the Alans thou takest but one side
<lb/>Of my descent unless I am unworthy</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.209"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>Of kingship and the cap of power
<lb/>As having for my grandsire Nushirwan,
<lb/>And for my sire Hurmuzd. Whom knowest thou
<lb/>More worthy?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram Chubina: <q>Wretch,
<lb/>And mad in deed and word! first, for thy talk
<lb/>Of guests: thou art thyself new-fangled though
<lb/>Thy talk is of the past. What have the words
<lb/>Of Shahs to do with thee? Thou art no sage,
<lb/>Or valiant cavalier. Thou wast the Alans’ king,
<lb/>And now though thou art chief thou art withal
<lb/>Inferior to the slave of slaves. Thou art
<lb/>A fruitless evil-doer in the world;
<lb/>No Shah art thou or fit to lead the mighty;
<lb/>But me men bless as Shah. I will not let thee
<lb/>Set foot on earth. Moreover, when I said:—
<lb/><q>Thou art ill-starred, unfit for rule and kingship,</q>
<lb/>I said it, worthless Shah! and may the state
<lb/>Be never thine! because the Iranians
<lb/>Are foes of thine, will struggle to uproot thee,
<lb/>Will rend thy skin and veins, and give the dogs
<lb/>Thy bones to eat.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied:—
<lb/><q>Knave! why so fierce and haughty, for foul words
<lb/>Disgrace a man? But from the very first
<lb/>Thy disposition hath been thus; clear wisdom
<lb/>Is severed from thy brain. Blest is the noble
<lb/>That eateth wisdom’s fruits! Fey divs discourse
<lb/>At large. I would not have a paladin
<lb/>Like thee made weak and ruined by his temper.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1876"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>I prithee banish anger from thy heart,
<lb/>Be not so moved and charm away thy wrath.
<lb/>Remember God, the just Possessor; base
<lb/>Thy wisdom on His justice. Thou hast now
<lb/>A height before thee higher than Bistun,
<lb/>And if a king shall ever come of thee</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.210"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>The Egyptian thorn will bear. Thy heart is full
<lb/>Of thoughts of rule but we shall see what God
<lb/>Ordaineth. Who hath taught thee such ill carriage,
<lb/>Such principles of Ahriman, I know not,
<lb/>But thy colloguer seeketh for thy death.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake and lighting from his ivory steed,
<lb/>And taking from his head the precious crown,
<lb/>Walked with his face turned sunwards, put his hope
<lb/>In God, and said: <q>O glorious Judge who bringest
<lb/>The tree of hope to fruit! Thou knowest who
<lb/>Is now affronting me, Thy slave, and how
<lb/>We should for very shame bewail the crown.
<lb/>If royalty is to desert our race
<lb/>I will not strive but be a thrall within
<lb/>A Fane of Fire and live on milk and herbs,
<lb/>Hoard neither gold nor silver and at prayer-time
<lb/>Wear woollen; but if rule is to be mine
<lb/>Thee will I serve in truth and equity.
<lb/>Oh! let my host prevail, give not my crown
<lb/>And palace to a slave. If I succeed,
<lb/>And haste to bring before Azargashasp
<lb/>Crown, steed, and armlets, earrings, torque, and robe
<lb/>Of gold adorned with gems, and pour withal
<lb/>Upon the dome of lapis-lazuli
<lb/>A hundred sacks of red dinars, and give
<lb/>The worshippers five thousand score of drachms,
<lb/>When I become the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Then will I strive to reinstate some city
<lb/>Unjustly desolated and the haunt
<lb/>Of onager and lion, leave it not
<lb/>To thorns and weeds, but send on my return
<lb/>From battle five score thousands of dinars.
<lb/>Those of the scions of Bahram and others
<lb/>That shall be brought to me as prisoners</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.211"/>
<p>
<q><lb/>Will I make servants of the glorious Fire,
<lb/>And glad the hearts of priest and archimage.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake these words and rose up from the dust;
<lb/>That speaker sore-oppressed was justified.
<lb/>Swift as a dust-cloud from the place of prayer
<lb/>He came and shouted to Bahram Chubina:—
<lb/><q>Thou hellish, div-like slave remote from wisdom,
<lb/>And far removed from precedent and Grace!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1877"/>
<lb/>Some rabid, tyrannous, and lusty div
<lb/>Hath blinded thee. Thou hast, in wisdom’s stead,
<lb/>Wrath and revenge, and won the divs’ applause.
<lb/>A thornbrake is a city, Hell a garden
<lb/>To thee; the lamp of wisdom hath died out
<lb/>Within thy brain and robbed thy mind and heart
<lb/>Of lustre. It was but a lying witch
<lb/>That led thee thus through greatness to a fall.
<lb/>To-day thou settest hand upon a shoot
<lb/>With leaves of bane and fruit of colocynth.
<lb/>Thy stock ne’er so aspired nor is the ‘aspirant
<lb/>Applauded. God hath not bestowed on thee
<lb/>The Grace and stature. Hast forgot Gurgin,
<lb/>Son of Milad? Thou unjust wretch! ne’er hope
<lb/>For what will never be. The crab hath not
<lb/>The eagle’s wing nor doth the eagle soar
<lb/>Aloft the sun. By holy God, by throne
<lb/>And crown if I shall come upon thee hostless,
<lb/>And if I blow a chilling blast upon thee...!
<lb/>Thou hast not seen me yet in fight and I
<lb/>Have heard but thy harsh words. I lean on Him
<lb/>That giveth victory. If I am unworthy
<lb/>To be a king let me not live a liege.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said:
<lb/><q>Thou fool possessed!
<lb/>Thy sire, that world-lord friendly to the Faith,
<lb/>Who ne’er blew cold on anyone, thou knewest not</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.212"/>
<p>
<lb/><q>To prize but flungest vilely from the throne,
<lb/>And thou wouldst fain be world-lord after him,
<lb/>Be vigilant and wise! Thou art impure,
<lb/>God’s foe, and wilt experience naught but ill
<lb/>From Him that giveth good, while if Hurmuzd
<lb/>Had been unjust and time and earth exclaimed
<lb/>Against him ’tis not fit for thee, his son,
<lb/>To king it in Iran and in Turan.
<lb/>Thy life will not be passed upon the throne;
<lb/>Content thee with the charnel for thou art
<lb/>Afar from fortune. For Hurmuzd will I
<lb/>Exact revenge; moreover, I am king
<lb/>Within Iran. Now make this clear to me:
<lb/>What upright man agreed that thou shouldst sear
<lb/>The eyes of Shahs or bid one do the deed?
<lb/>Take thou henceforth the kingship to be mine
<lb/>From Sun to Fish’s back.</q><note n="1">See Vol. i, p. 71.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Replied: <q>May his sire’s woe ne’er joy this slave.
<lb/>Thus was it written and what was to be
<lb/>Hath been; how long wilt thou add word to word?

<milestone unit="calced" n="1878"/>

<lb/><q>Thou makest thyself king, thou who at death
<lb/>Wilt not possess a shroud! So far as folk,
<lb/>And barded steeds can go thou art a monarch—
<lb/>In expectation—but thou hast no house,
<lb/>Home, land, and birth; thou art a windbag king.
<lb/>With thy false title and such wares as these
<lb/>Thou wilt not shine upon the royal throne.
<lb/>There have been brave men ere thy time—aspirants
<lb/>With massive maces—yet they never sought
<lb/>The kingship, being lieges, nor pretended
<lb/>To crown and throne, but thou becomest ever
<lb/>More rabid and art lost to modesty.</q><note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The World-lord maketh kings for justice-sake,
<lb/>Or for their parts or on account of birth,

<pb n="8.213"/>

<lb/>Bestowing kingship on the worthiest,
<lb/>The wisest or the least injurious.
<lb/>My sire made me the monarch of the Alans
<lb/>Since through thy wiles he was concerned for me,
<lb/>And now God hath bestowed on me the kingship,
<lb/>Throne, greatness, and the crown of power. I have them
<lb/>From Him who is the Master of the world,
<lb/>From Him who knoweth all, by the appointment
<lb/>Of king Hurmuzd who from his sire received
<lb/>The throne as heirloom, from high priest and sages,
<lb/>The mighty men and the experienced chiefs,
<lb/>According to the Faith which once Zarduhsht,
<lb/>The wise and ancient, brought from Paradise,<note n="2">See Vol. v., p. 33.</note>
<lb/>And gave Luhrasp the word of God, which he
<lb/>Accepted and transmitted to Gushtasp.
<lb/>All those that have aggrieved me, all whose treasures
<lb/>I have received, are under my protection,
<lb/>Be they my friends or foes. The mendicants
<lb/>At lurk from wasted cities will I make
<lb/>Rich, be they outcasts or of mine own kin,
<lb/>And bramble-brakes like Paradise, fulfilled
<lb/>With men, with cattle, and with tilth, ignore,
<lb/>By way of compensation, no good thing
<lb/>Until we quit this world for that, will make
<lb/>Our heart the scales, will weigh, and use the might
<lb/>Of our own arm. What time Hurmuzd, the world-lord,
<lb/>Ruled justly, earth and time rejoiced in him.
<lb/>The son past doubt should have his father’s throne,
<lb/>Should have the crown, the girdle, and the fortune,
<lb/>But as for thee, thou wicked, crafty man,
<lb/>Who wast the first to war against Hurmuzd!
<lb/>No ill hath come unless by thy command,

<milestone unit="calced" n="1879"/>

<lb/>Thy spells, thy guile, and plotting. If God will
<lb/>I will make dark in vengeance for the Shah
<pb n="8.214"/>

<lb/>Bright Sol to thee. Now who deserveth crown,
<lb/>And if not I who is there?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>Valiant one!</q>
<lb/>Rejoined Bahram Chubina, <q>he is worthy
<lb/>That carried off from thee the sovereignty.
<lb/>When, from the daughter of Papak, Ardshir
<lb/>Was born, and the Ashkanians had the sway,
<lb/>Grew he not mighty and slew Ardawan,
<lb/>Whose throne he won? And now five hundred years
<lb/>Have passed by and Sasanian heads and crowns
<lb/>Are waxing cold. Now is my day for throne
<lb/>And diadem; the headship and the work,
<lb/>Allied with conquering fortune, are for me.
<lb/>When I behold thy fortune, face, and troops,
<lb/>Thy crown and throne, like some led lion roused
<lb/>Will I abolish the Sasanians,
<lb/>Erase them from the roll and trample down
<lb/>Sasan, both head and crown. The power should be
<lb/>The Ashkanians’ if the wise would hear aright.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>Contentious fool!
<lb/>If kingship is for those of royal race
<lb/>What dost thou in their midst? What are the folk
<lb/>Of Rai but double-faced? And what as men?
<lb/>But few at first they joined Sikandar’s host,
<lb/>And arming on the Rumans’ side soon won
<lb/>The Kaian throne. It did not please the Maker,
<lb/>And ruin came upon them from themselves;
<lb/>The Judge that giveth succour crowned Ardshir,
<lb/>And he was worthy of the royal crown
<lb/>Although he had no treasure and dinars.
<lb/>Those great men’s work hath passed away, our words
<lb/>Are wind. God choosing him for sovereignty
<lb/>Saw naught but good in him. Now who deserveth
<lb/>The government and who shall be the lord
<lb/>Of this unstable world? Inform me truly,
<lb/>Choose the good path and shun perversity.</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.215"/>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina hearing changed his ground,
<lb/>And said: <q>I am Bahram, the warrior,
<lb/>The rooter up of kings.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Made answer: <q>Thou hast heard the sage’s saw:—
<lb/><q>The equipage of greatness ne’er commit
<lb/>To mean or wayward folk of little wit,
<lb/>For they, when they have got it from thee, take
<lb/>Their ease and if thou ask it back they quake.</q>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1880"/>
<lb/>My father, who was rash and ill-advised,
<lb/>Discerned not close from open and among
<lb/>His many great and small gave men of straw
<lb/>The royal equipage which came not back
<lb/>Upon demand for he that was possessed
<lb/>Thereof had grown intoxicate thereby.
<lb/>What was the saying of the sweet-voiced sage?
<lb/><q>'Twill cause thee pain and toil to establish men
<lb/>Unstable: woo not the ungrateful then.</q>
<lb/>Thou wast a brave man, keen and of high aims,
<lb/>But thine ill nature made thee an ill-doer.
<lb/>My father made thee first among the chiefs;
<lb/>Thou wast the greatest in the sovereignty;
<lb/>But royal favour and the silvern throne
<lb/>Have made thee drunk and err. The name Chubina
<lb/>Is now Bahram, the silvern throne become
<lb/>A snare to thee. There seated thou art fain
<lb/>To mount the moon; thou wast the general,
<lb/>And wouldst be Shah. No sage e’er held such talk;
<lb/>I wot that thou consortest with the Div.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina answered: <q>Evil one!
<lb/>Reviling is thy sole accomplishment.
<lb/>Thou heedest not God’s covenant, thou seekest
<lb/>This state whereof thou art not worthy, and blindest
<lb/>The Shah! How can such deeds as these be hidden?
<lb/>Thy friends are hostile, being thine in word,
<lb/>But mine in heart. The Khan is mine ally

<pb n="8.216"/>

<lb/>With all the armies of Iran and Chin,
<lb/>For I am just and kindly with a hand
<lb/>And sword. No enemy will conquer me.
<lb/>I will transfer the power from Pars to Rai,
<lb/>And ban the name of Kaian, set up justice,
<lb/>And reinstate the customs of Milad.<note n="1">Cf. p. 72.</note>
<lb/>I spring from famed Arash<note n="2">See Vol. vi. p. 197.</note> and am in war
<lb/>A fire unquenchable, the grandson I
<lb/>Of great Gurgin and the consuming Flame
<lb/>Upon Barzin. It was king Sawa’s mind
<lb/>To leave not in Iran throne, crown, or signet,
<lb/>To rase the Fanes of Fire and suffer not
<lb/>Naurtiz and Sada feast. The Iranians too
<lb/>Were all enslaved till I girt up my loins,
<lb/>And by an arrow from my bow determined
<lb/>King Sawa’s life. If thou knowest not the sum
<lb/>Of that rash monarch’s troops go count a thousand
<lb/>Four hundred times. Twelve hundred elephants
<lb/>Of war had he. Thou wouldst have said: <q>The earth
<lb/>Will hold them not.</q> That great host fled while I
<lb/>Roared like a lusty lion in their rear.

<milestone unit="calced" n="1881"/>

<lb/>Know thou that none without accomplishment
<lb/>Doth rashly seek the seat of mighty men.
<lb/>My helmet savoureth of the crown, my sword
<lb/>Will win the ivory throne, but if a gnat
<lb/>Shall war with thee ’twill bring thee from thy throne
<lb/>To earth.</q>
</p>



<p>Khusrau Parwiz replied:
<lb/><q>Thou luckless!
<lb/>Why not be mindful of Gurgin at Rai,
<lb/>Whom fortune never succoured in the world,
<lb/>And who had not throne, majesty, and state?
<lb/>None knew thy name; thou wast obscure and poor.
<lb/>The great Mihran Sitad came and informed
<lb/>The monarch of the age about thee, thus

<pb n="8.217"/>

<lb/>Exalting thee from darksome dust, but thou
<lb/>Hast lost sight of that day! He furnished thee
<lb/>With treasures, arms, and troops, and Rustam’s banner
<lb/>Resplendent as the moon. God did not will
<lb/>That Turkmans out of Chin should waste Iran,
<lb/>And helped thee in the fight with them; thy helm
<lb/>Rose cloudward since the Lord of circling heaven
<lb/>Willed the Great King success; but thou dost take
<lb/>The merit to thyself who never sawest
<lb/>The great and good. If kingship is to quit
<lb/>The Kaian race why girdest thou thy loins?
<lb/>Twill need one like Sikandar to obscure
<lb/>The fortune of the king of kings. Mayst thou
<lb/>With thy div’s face and dusty hue attain
<lb/>To naught except a ditch. Thy waywardness
<lb/>And conduct dimmed the Shah’s days. Thou hast put
<lb/>My name on drachms and striven to ruin me.
<lb/>Thou art ill’s source in this world and supreme

<lb/>King Sawa all the troops believed that they
<lb/>Would never see defeat, they were so drunk
<lb/>And satiate with spoil. Thy warriors,
<lb/>So fearless, must not perish by my hand;
<lb/>I would not that the country of Iran
<lb/>Should lose this mighty warrior-host—all chiefs

<lb/>Of might. Now tell me, in Arash’s days
<lb/>Who was the Shah for this may end our parley?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina answered: <q>Minuchihr
<lb/>Was then the Shah and had the host and crown.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>Ill-natured one!
<lb/>Thou know’st that he was monarch of the world;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1883"/>
<lb/>Know’st thou not that Arash was but his slave,
<lb/>And bowed to his directions and commands?
<lb/>Just so it was with valiant Kai Khusrau
<lb/>With such as Rustam for his officer,
<lb/>For Rustam might have seized the world, the throne,
<lb/>And style of Shah, but held to precedent,
<lb/>And never glanced that way. Then why dost thou
<lb/>Not follow me and hail Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>As Shah? Thou dust-face! thou art but a div,
<lb/>Like Ahriman; the crown and throne of Shahs
<lb/>Have stirred thy greed.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said:—
<lb/><q>Thou miscreant! rightly art thou from Sasan,
<lb/>Who was a shepherd and was shepherd-born;
<lb/>Papak was not the first to make him one.</q>
<note>According to both the traditions given in the Shahnama Sasan’s ancestors had been shepherds or in similar menial employment for generations. See Vols. v. p. 291, vi. 211.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>Thou evil-doer!
<lb/>Thine arrogance is not Sasan’s. Thy words
<lb/>Are wholly lies, and falsehood is no honour.
<lb/>Thou comest of bad-natured, worthless men,
<lb/>And spring’st not from Sasan.</q>

<p>
<lb/><q>The shepherdship,</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina answered, <q>of Sasan
<lb/>Ne’er will be hidden.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Khusrau Parwiz:—
<lb/><q>Dara, when dying, gave not to Sasan
<lb/>The crown of majesty. Though lost was fortune
<lb/>Was lineage lost? No talk will turn injustice
<lb/>To justice. Seek’st thou, having for thine own

        <lb/>His sister heard of his return, put off
        <lb/>Her splendid crown and, when a slave had brought
        <lb/>Her veil, ran forth in dudgeon sore of heart
        <lb/>To meet him and thus spake: <q>O warlike chief!
        <lb/>How didst thou fare, say, with Khusrau Parwiz?
        <lb/>If he be hot and hasty through his youth
        <lb/>Relax no effort in the cause of peace.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina answered thus:—
        <lb/><q>One must not reckon him among the Shahs.
        <lb/>No valiant cavalier or sage is he,
        <lb/>Not generous or brilliant. Parts are better
        <lb/>Than birth, and kings should have them.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>His wise sister
        <lb/>Replied: <q>O shrewd, ambitious chief! if I
        <lb/>Say much thou wilt not hear me but display
        <lb/>Ill-temper and ill-nature. Call to mind
        <lb/>The saying of the aphorist of Balkh:—
        <lb/><q>When any one shall truth from hiding bring,
        <lb/>And tell thy faults, truth is a bitter thing.</q>
        <lb/>Think not to waste thy country for thou hast

        <lb/>And lost forthwith his ears on either side.</q>
        <lb/>Court not the world’s reproach; none of thy race
        <lb/>Hath worn the crown. Had this youth intervened not
        <lb/>I had not been thus seared and dark of soul;
        <lb/>But as it is his sire is living, the throne
        <lb/>Of sovereignty is still in place yet thou

        <lb/>But all night long mine eyes are filled with blood.
        <lb/>Thine only aim is pain and malison;

        <lb/>Consider now, who was it sought thee out
        <lb/>Save king Hurmuzd? But since king Sawa’s throne
        <lb/>And goods came to thy hands thou didst assume
        <lb/>The crown, and having grown renowned through him
        <lb/>Art seeking for the imperial throne; but know
        <lb/>That every good thing is from God and be
        <lb/>Not ingrate to our Shah; presume not thus
        <lb/>Upon thy stricken fields. Thou hast gained honour,
        <lb/>But be not arrogant. Thou hast at heart
        <lb/>Consorted with the Div and hast grown guilty
        <lb/>In God’s sight. When Hurmuzd was wroth and raved
        <lb/>Through what the foul Ayin Gashasp had said
        <lb/>Thou shouldest have been patient and not made it
        <lb/>A liege’s opportunity for war;
        <lb/>And in his great affliction when his son
        <lb/>Came forth to fight from Barda ’twas thy duty
        <lb/>To visit the young Shah and ornament
        <lb/>His new throne as he wished. The youth had then
        <lb/>Adopted thine advice and thou hadst not
        <lb/>Seen evil days but quiet, joy, and triumph.
        <lb/>Why these designs upon the crown and throne?
        <lb/>Thou knowest that there still are princes left,
        <lb/>Both old and young, descended from Ardshir,
        <lb/>With wealth and countless hosts. Who in Iran
        <lb/>Will hail thee king? If any king with treasure

        <lb/>Who marched upon the country of Iran;

        <lb/>Made this world and spread over it high heaven
        <lb/>Men have not seen a cavalier like Sam,
        <lb/>Whom not the rending lion would confront,
        <lb/>Yet when it happened that Naudar became

        <lb/>He said, 'that ever captain of the host

        <lb/>Is witness, but the thing hath gone too far;
        <lb/>My heart and brain are sick with greed and I
        <lb/>Must grow whole or resign my head to death,

    <p>
        <lb/>The youthful king for his part
        <lb/>Recrossed the bridge of Nahrawan, rejoicing,

    <pb n="8.224"/>
        <lb/>Entitled by their rank beside the throne
        <lb/>Of sovereignty, and said: <q>Good-hearted chiefs,
        <lb/>Adept and veteran! of this my kingship
        <lb/>This is my primal act—a mere essay—
        <lb/>And none doth owe us praise though our intent
        <lb/>Be good, and ye have had no good from us
        <lb/>While we must now augment your toils and griefs.
        <lb/>Ye served mine ancestors and have seen much
        <lb/>Of this world’s salts and sours. I will disclose
        <lb/>My purpose, hidden from the host, to you;
        <lb/>My words must go no further, that would mar
        <lb/>My scheme if it were published to the troops.
        <lb/>I mean to lead the host to-night to battle,
        <lb/>For I have parleyed with Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>Who is an active, skilful cavalier,
        <lb/>Though I discerned no wisdom in his head,
        <lb/>Or in the heads of his illustrious troops.
        <lb/>His fight with Sawa is his only theme,
        <lb/>He telleth o’er and o’er the same old tale.
        <lb/>He thinketh me a foolish youth and fain
        <lb/>Would frighten me with mace and scimitar,
        <lb/>Not knowing that I attack by night and so
        <lb/>Gain confidence. If ye will share the fray
        <lb/>With me I will not loiter but, when night
        <lb/>Shall steep her face in ambergris and loose
        <lb/>Her musky locks, do ye mount armed and grasping
        <lb/>The mace and scimitar.</q>
        <lb/>They all agreed
        <lb/>To do the Shah’s behest. When he had gone
        <lb/>Back to his tent he put all strangers forth.
        <lb/>He sent for Gustaham and for Bandwi,
        <lb/>And for Gurdwi, a veteran warrior,
        <lb/>And told his purpose of a night-attack
        <lb/>In hopes that they would aid. Said Gustaham:—

    <p>
        <lb/><q>O king! why put such confidence in fight?

    <pb n="8.225"/>
 
        <lb/>Thy soldiers and the soldiers of the foe
        <lb/>Are one in heart and body; on one side
        <lb/>Are grandsons, on the other grandsires. What
        <lb/>Deception can there be? Here is a brother,
        <lb/>And there a father; they are all akin;
        <lb/>How shall son war with sire? Encourage not
        <lb/>The wishes of thy foes by this design.
        <lb/>This was no matter for the host; thy words
        <lb/>Have ruined all.</q>
        <lb/>Gurdwi said: <q>All is over,
        <lb/>E’en as a wind that passeth o’er the plain.
        <lb/>Power, passion, treasury, and troops make err
        <lb/>A young man’s head. Do not be thou to-night
        <lb/>Upon the field and suffer not the host
        <lb/>And treasure to be lost, because I doubt not
        <lb/>That all our secret plans and preparations
        <lb/>Will be reported to the other side;

        <lb/>Nastuh, the chief and burner up of heroes,
        <lb/>And others who would serve to guard the troops,
        <lb/>The treasure and himself. They sought a hill
        <lb/>That would avail if fight were toward—a place
        <lb/>All grass and apt for feasts. Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Thence viewed the host from far.

    <p>
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina,

        <lb/>Send to them, ye that have such—men at one

        <lb/>With you in word and Faith. If they will come
        <lb/>And do my will, and stake their lives as pledges

        <lb/>And they shall all be nobles like yourselves.
        <lb/>The troops from Barda and from Ardabil,
        <lb/>And slack Armenians—a band or two—
        <lb/>Remain. We fear them not in fight while those
        <lb/>From Barda are but as a pinch of dust.</q>
    </p>

        <lb/>Sage, fluent, heedful, who thus charged departed,
        <lb/>And speeding onward through the longsome night
        <lb/>Declared his message to the Iranian chiefs,
        <lb/>And heard their answer: <q>Till the hosts engage
        <lb/>We will not leave Khusrau Parwiz. This matter,
        <lb/>We fear, will prove a long one. He will make
        <lb/>A night-attack, so feel not ye secure.</q>

        The nobles toiled to load,
        <lb/>And carry off, this treasure. Then appeared
        <lb/>A dragon-flag; the world turned violet.
        <lb/>Behind the flag rode brave Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>Who robbed the world of lustre in the fray.
        <lb/>He and Khusrau Parwiz encountered, both
        <lb/>Redoubted warriors and savage lions.
        <lb/>Like elephants of war they raged and smote
        <lb/>Each other on the head. All lion-like
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina wheeled, his weapons failed
        <lb/>Against the foe, and thus till set of sun
        <lb/>The conflict passed all bounds. Then came Tukhar
        <lb/>To tell Khusrau Parwiz that he had drawn
        <lb/>The treasure and the baggage to the bridge,
        <lb/>Whereat the monarch said to Gustaham:—
        <lb/><q>We have not any helpers in the fight;
        <lb/>We are but ten; this is a mighty host,
        <lb/>And led on by a valiant paladin.
        <lb/>Although we have the Grace upon our side
        <lb/>We lack for friends, so flee we. Timely flight
        <lb/>Is better than affray. I may not tarry,
        <lb/>For I am all alone.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The unpractised youth
        <lb/>Fared till he reached the bridge of Nahrawan,
        <lb/>Pursued all hotly by Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>His head all vengeance and his heart all strife.
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, when he perceived this, stopped
    <pb n="8.229"/>
        <lb/>Upon the bridge and summoned to his presence
        <lb/>The veteran Gustaham. <q>Bring me my bow,</q>
        <lb/>He said; <q>’tis mine interpreter in war.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The treasurer, who was Gustaham himself,
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1890"/>
        <lb/>Produced the bow. <note>Son trésorier le lui apporta, et Gustehem était en cette affaire le lieutenant du roi. Mohl.</note> The valiant chieftain took it,
        <lb/>And robbed the air of lustre with his shafts,
        <lb/>Showered them like hail and pegged with each a helm
        <lb/>And head together. Then Bahram Chubina,
        <lb/>That Lion, charged with lasso in his hand
        <lb/>And Dragon under him. With lasso only
        <lb/>He passed behind Khusrau Parwiz who saw,
        <lb/>Rejoiced, strung up his bow and with a shaft
        <lb/>Struck on the breast Bahram Chubina’s horse;
        <lb/>Its task was done. That general afoot
        <lb/>Despairing took his buckler while Yalan-sina
        <lb/>Advanced like dust and charged. The atheling,
        <lb/>Who knew him valiant, aimed and hurt his steed.
        <lb/>Yalan-sina fled from the bridge afoot,
        <lb/>And with him fled the rest, both old and young.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now when Bahram Chubina thus withdrew
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, swift as a dust-cloud, broke
        <lb/>The bridge and went to Taisafon in dudgeon,
        <lb/>With pain at heart and eyes fulfilled with blood.
        <lb/>He barred the city-gates with iron bars,
        <lb/>Sat down amid a multitude of cares,
        <lb/>From every quarter called to him the Great,
        <lb/>And posted sentinels at every gate.

        <lb/>Thence weeping blood and liver-pierced he went
        <lb/>Before his sire, gave greeting, tarried long,
        <lb/>And said: <q>The cavalier, the paladin,
        <lb/>Whom thou didst choose, O king! came as do Shahs
        <lb/>That have the Grace and brought a numerous host.
        <lb/>I counselled him but 'twas of no avail,
        <lb/>He only cared for war and conflict. Never
        <lb/>Be his name current! All against my will
        <lb/>Was fought a great fight, and the stars brought scath
        <lb/>On many. All my troops deserted me;
        <lb/>Thou wouldst have said they saw and passed me by,
        <lb/>And, not reflecting, hailed Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>As Shah. Pursuing me he led his troops,
        <lb/>As 'twere a moving mountain, to the bridge
 
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1891"/>

        Of Nahrawan, and I, when mine estate
        <lb/>No longer flourished, fled and scaped the net
        <lb/>Of bale. As I account of gain and loss
        <lb/>The Arabs only may prove serviceable,
        <lb/>And, if the king bid, I will bring their horsemen
        <lb/>In countless numbers.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        <q>This is ill-advised,</q>
        <lb/>Replied Hurmuzd, <q>for now thou hast no standing.
        <lb/>To go to them is labour lost, for we
        <lb/>Possess not men, or arbalists or treasure.
        <lb/>The Arabs will not help when there is naught
        <lb/>To gain or lose but in despite and dudgeon
        <lb/>Will sell thee to thy foes, yet God will aid,
        <lb/>And smiling fortune side with thee. If thou

        Hath said. He will assist thee with his treasure
        <lb/>And troops. In that land are both men and stores,
        <lb/>And arms and host arrayed. Moreover all
        <lb/>That spring from Faridun are kin to thee,
        <lb/>And will assist thee in thy need.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thereat
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz kissed earth and gave the praises
        <lb/>Due to the Great. Then to Bandwi, Gurdwi,
        <lb/>And Gustaham he said: <q>We must consort
        <lb/>With grief and toil. Take order, pack, and yield
        <lb/>Our country to the foe.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Said Gustaham:—
        <lb/><q>Ne’er mayst thou see ill hap, O king!</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        He answered:—
        <lb/><q>The circling heaven produceth wrath and love
        <lb/>By turns.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        With that the watchman cried: <q>O Shah,
        <lb/>Just and auspicious! from the road hath risen
        <lb/>Dark dust. Amid a host a standard waveth
        <lb/>Charged with a dragon, and Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Raised it beside the Nahrawan.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thereat
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz gat on his steed like smoke,
        <lb/>And fled like flying dust with that blue banner
        <lb/>Behind him. Turning him about he saw
        <lb/>Bandwi and Gustaham proceeding slowly,
        <lb/>And shouted to them in an angry tone:—
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1892"/>
    <p>
        <q>O villains! what hath happened that yon foes

        <lb/>Why ride at leisure with Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Hard on your backs?</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bandwi replied: <q>O king!
        <lb/>Be not concerned at him; he will not see
        <lb/>Our dust, the host's flag is too far away.
        <lb/>Thy friends all say there is no cause for haste
        <lb/>Because Bahram Chubina, when he reacheth
    <pb n="8.232"/>
        The palace, will at once give to Hurmuzd
        <lb/>The crown and throne, will sit as minister
        <lb/>Beside him, and will angle to some purpose
        <lb/>By writing from his sovereign to Caesar
        <lb/>To this effect: <q>A worthless slave hath fled
        <lb/>This country; let him not obtain asylum
        <lb/>In Rum. Each time that he hath raised himself
        <lb/>He hath done hurt and damage to your land.
        <lb/>When he arriveth put him into bonds,
        <lb/>And fill with trouble his rejoicing heart.
        <lb/>Return him to this court and tarry not
        <lb/>Until he have grown great,</q> and they will bind him,
        <lb/>And send him back in tears and strongly guarded.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Khusrau Parwiz heard this with troubled heart,
        <lb/>His cheek gloomed at their words and he replied:—
        <lb/><q>Ill-fortune well may treat us thus, but words
        <lb/>Are long and deeds are strong; trust we in God.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        He urged his steed and said: <q>What good and bad
        <lb/>The World-lord hath writ o’er our heads will come,
        <lb/>No musing can avert it. May our foes
        <lb/>Ne’er have their will.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        When he had gone the two
        <lb/>Unjust ones turned back eager for revenge.
        <lb/>Arrived, they sought the palace of the Shah,
        <lb/>All dudgeon and with hearts prepared for crime.
        <lb/>When they had passed the gate and reached the throne
        <lb/>They straightway took the string from off a bow,
        <lb/>Flung it forthwith around the monarch’s neck,
        <lb/>And hung his honoured person. Passed that crown
        <lb/>And throne of king of kings: thou wouldst have said:—
    </p>
    <p>
        <q>Hurmuzd was never in the world at all.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The custom of revolving time it is
        <lb/>To furnish sometimes sweets and sometimes bane;
        <lb/>Seek not for profit from a stock like this
        <lb/>Because the quest will bring thee naught but pain.
    </p>
    <pb n="8.233"/>
    <p>
        When thus Hurmuzd’s days ended and the throne,
        <lb/>That happy seat, remained unfilled, forthwith
        <lb/>Arose a sound of drums; those murderers’ cheeks
        <lb/>Became like sandarac. Upon the road
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina’s standard came in sight
        <lb/>Amid his troops, and that outrageous pair—
        <lb/>Bandwi and Gustaham—fled from the palace,
        <lb/>And hasted till they reached Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>Who, seeing their wan looks, knew that their hearts
        <lb/>Contained some secret, else would they have quitted

    <p>
        The master of the world? His cheeks became
        <lb/>Like flowers of fenugreek but he revealed
        <lb/>Naught to that savage pair. He bade his troops:—
        <lb/><q>Turn from the highway for a host approacheth.
        <lb/>Take the long route across the unwatered plain,
        <lb/>And let your bodies grow inured to pain.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><head>How Bahram Chubina sent Troops after Khusrau Parwiz and how Bandwi contrived to rescue him from their Hands</head>
    <p>On entering the palace of the Shah
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina chose from his fierce host
        <lb/>Six thousand wielders of the scimitar,
        <lb/>Mailed, to pursue the king, and put Bahram,
        <lb/>The son of Siyawush, in charge of those
        <lb/>Famed, warlike troops, while on the other part
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz took to the waste to ’scape
        <lb/>His foes with life, and reached at length a hold
        <lb/>With battlements of viewless height. Folk called it
        <lb/><q>The House of God</q>—a shrine, a blesséd spot,
        <lb/>With bishops and a metropolitan,
    <pb n="8.234"/>
        <lb/>A place for penitents. He there addressed
        <lb/>A holy man: <q>What food is there to hand?</q>
        <lb/>A bishop said: <q>There are unleavened loaves
        <lb/>And watercress, my lord! If such thou needest
        <lb/>Let it be none save ours.</q>
        <lb/>The king forthwith
        <lb/>Alighted with his escort. That aspirant
        <lb/>With his two courtiers took in hand for prayer
        <lb/>The sacred twigs, then on the soft, blue sand
        <lb/>They sat and ate in haste of what there was.
        <lb/>Thereafter he addressed the bishop thus:
        <lb/><q>Hast thou no wine, old sir whose steps are blest?</q>
        <lb/>He said: <q>We manufacture wine from dates;
        <lb/>We make it in the heat of summer-time.
        <lb/>There is a little left, clear as rose-water,
        <lb/>And red as coral in the sun.</q>
        <lb/>Forthwith
        <lb/>He brought a cup thereof and it eclipsed
        <lb/>The hue of Sol. Khusrau Parwiz drank three,
        <lb/>Partook of barley-bread and, when his wits
        <lb/>Were warmed with ruddy wine, slept with his head
        <lb/>Laid on Bandwi’s lap on the yielding sand,
        <lb/>All sorrowful of soul and liver-pierced.
        <lb/>Just as he slept the senior bishop came.

    <milestone unit="calced" n="1894"/>
    <p>
        <lb/><q>Black dust-clouds have arisen on the road,</q>
        <lb/>He said; <q>behind them is a mighty host.</q>
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>It is bad luck
        <lb/>That foes should seek us just as men and steeds
        <lb/>Are spent. The inevitable day hath come.</q>
        <lb/>Then spake Bandwi the good at need: <q>Yon chief
        <lb/>Approacheth.</q>
        <lb/>Said Khusrau Parwiz: <q>Good friend!
        <lb/>Direct us in the matter.</q>
        <lb/>He rejoined:—
        <lb/><q>I will devise escape for thee, O king!

    <pb n="8.235"/>
   
        <lb/>In this strait, though I shall have sacrificed
        <lb/>My life to save the monarch of the world.</q>
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>A sage of Chin
        <lb/>Hath uttered better things in this regard:—
        <lb/><q>In Paradise shall be his future state
        <lb/>Who here hath tilled about a monarch’s gate.
        <lb/>The plastering cannot abide in place
        <lb/>When city-walls are levelled to their base.
        <lb/>When mighty cities perish out of hand,
        <lb/>Let not the hospitals be left to stand.</q>
        <lb/>If shift thou knowest use it; holy God
        <lb/>Will save thee from the need of other help.</q>
        <lb/>Bandwi said: <q>Let me have the crown of gold,
        <lb/>The earrings, girdle, and the robe from Chin,
        <lb/>Gold-woven and tulip-hued, and while I don them
        <lb/>Abide not thou. Go with thy troops apace
        <lb/>As sailors speed a vessel o’er the deep.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The youth did as Bandwi advised and thence
        <lb/>Companioned with the wind. When he had made
        <lb/>Shift thus to flee, Bandwi, the veteran,
        <lb/>Turned to the bishop, saying: <q>Ye must tarry
        <lb/>Unseen of all upon the mountain-top,</q>
        <lb/>Then went himself dust-swift within the shrine,
        <lb/>And with all speed shut fast the iron door,
        <lb/>Assumed the gold-embroidered robe and donned
        <lb/>The royal crown. He went upon the roof,
        <lb/>And thence unwillingly beheld a host
        <lb/>On every side. He waited till they came
        <lb/>Up to the hold to fight. At sight of him
        <lb/>With gold crown, earrings, torque, and belt all cried:—
        <lb/><q>It is Khusrau Parwiz with his new crown
        <lb/>And robes.</q>
        <lb/>Bandwi, when certain that the troops
        <lb/>Had taken him to be the Shah himself,
        <lb/>Went from the roof, donned his own clothes with speed,
    <pb n="8.236"/>
        <lb/>Then fearlessly returned and said: <q>Young braves!
        <lb/>To whom shall I address me as your chief
        <lb/>Because I have a message from the Shah
        <lb/>To give in presence of the mighty men?</q>
    </p>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1895"/>
    <p>
        The son of Siyawush, on hearing this,
        <lb/>Said: <q>I am chief and I am hight Bahram.</q>
        <lb/>Bandwi replied: <q>The world-lord saith: <q>My journey
        <lb/>Hath much distressed me; all our beasts are sore,
        <lb/>Foundered and all amort with lengthy travel.
        <lb/>I reached this house of penitents for rest,
        <lb/>But will at day-break give up worldly hopes,
        <lb/>And take with you the longsome road that leadeth
        <lb/>To great Bahram Chubina, and herein
        <lb/>I do not seek delay that heaven perchance
        <lb/>May succour me. Mine ancestors were wont
        <lb/>To keep the laws of honour and good faith,
        <lb/>And through their long and fortunate careers
        <lb/>They ne’er refused when subjects asked a boon.
        <lb/>So now that fortune is my foe I make
        <lb/>An open breast to you, for from bright Sol
        <lb/>To darksome dust the will of God is done.</q></q>
        <lb/>The chief agreed and every one that heard
        <lb/>The Shah’s words grieved for him. The troopers all
        <lb/>Dismounted and kept guard on him that night.
        <lb/>Next day Bandwi went to the roof upon
        <lb/>The side that faced Bahram and said: <q>The Shah
        <lb/>Is praying and will do naught else to-day.
        <lb/>He spent last night in prayer. Besides, the sun
        <lb/>Is high, he must not suffer from the heat.
        <lb/>Leave him in peace to-day. At dawn to-morrow
        <lb/>He shall surrender.</q>
        <lb/><q>This may prove a trifle,</q>
        <lb/>Bahram said to his chiefs, <q>or else of moment.
        <lb/>If we shall press him much he may be wroth
        <lb/>And fall on us. He is a host himself,
    <pb n="8.237"/>
        <lb/>A world-aspirant, shrewd and valorous.
        <lb/>If he be slain in fight Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Will send to dust from us. 'Tis best to wait
        <lb/>To-day, although our stores are running low,
        <lb/>To see if he will yield without contention.</q>
        <lb/>Thus was it till the night rose o’er the mountains,
        <lb/>And her host gathered, then both far and wide
        <lb/>The troops spread, kindling fires on every side.

    <lb/><q> Experienced one! when dust rose from the plain
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz at sight of you departed,
    <lb/>He and his troops, in haste toward Rum, and now,
    <lb/>Wert thou to wing it eagle-like and soar
    <lb/>Above the sun, thou wouldst not spy the Shah
    <lb/>Unless in Rum where he hath aged by now ;
    <lb/>But if ye grant me quarter I will come
    <lb/>Forth to thy valiant chief and I will answer
    <lb/>All questions asked of me about ourselves,
    <lb/>But if not I will arm and send the dust
    <lb/>In combat to the sun.</q>
    <lb/>The youth’s heart aged
    <lb/>With grief when he heard this. <q> What will it profit,</q>
    <lb/>He asked his comrades, <q> if I send the reek
    <lb/>Up from Bandwi? The better course will be
    <lb/>To take him as he is with mind unclouded
    <lb/>Before the paladin to tell whatever
    <lb/>He knoweth of the Shah and either lose
    <pb n="8.238"/>
    <lb/>His head or keep his crown.</q>
    <lb/>Then to Bandwi :—
    <lb/><q> Discuss this question with Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>Thou evil schemer ! </q>
    <lb/>Then Bandwi, the Lion,
    <lb/>Came down and went back with the valiant chiefs.
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina heard of their return,
    <lb/>And that Khusrau Parwiz bent on revenge
    <lb/>Had gone to Rum, and vehemently raged
    <lb/>Against the son of Siyavush, exclaiming :—
    <lb/><q>Thou luckless miscreant ! thou hast disobeyed.
    <lb/>Fool that I am! I have approved a fool! </q>
    <lb/>He summoned next Bandwi, the ambitious one,
    <lb/>And turned the wrath on him: <q> Thou miscreant knave !
    <lb/>Blame-worthy hare who hast been so foolish
    <lb/>As thus to gull my troops! Thou couldst not rest
    <lb/>Through thine ill nature and hast now become
    <lb/>One with accursed Khusrau Parwiz, hast made
    <lb/>A youth a veteran and hast come to boast :—
    <lb/><q>I will renew this outworn age.</q> </q>

    <lb/>They gyved Bandwi’s feet, and Bahram Chubina

        <p>
        <lb/>When Sol unsheathed its sword, and when its veil
        <lb/>Of yellow showed, Bahram Chubina sent
        <lb/>And called the magnates, seating them upon
        <lb/>The dais of the kings on golden seats,
        <lb/>Which he had ranged around, and sat in Joy
        <lb/>As conquering monarchs do. Thereafter he
        <lb/>Spake with a mighty utterance thus and said :—
        <lb/><q>Ye that are worshipful! now make response
        <lb/>In full assurance and auspiciously
        <lb/>Advise upon my words. Give them all heed,
        <lb/>And note my prompt dispatch. Ye will not find
        <lb/>A worse Shah than Zahhak, search as ye may,
        <lb/>Who slew his sire for kingship’s sake, whereby 
        <lb/>Iran fell to his hands ;<note n="1">See Vol. i. pp. 136, 139.</note> and now again
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, a man unjust and cursed,
        <lb/>Hath slain his father and hath gone to Rum;
        <lb/>And so till one of royal race appeareth,
        <lb/>One fit to claim the throne and make crown, girdle,
        <lb/>And fortune his who, think ye, is the man
        <lb/>To gird him at this present to restore
        <lb/>The precedents of kings? I swear by Him,
        <lb/>Who is the Master of the sun on high,
        <lb/>That I will give you aidance in the quest.</q>
        <lb/>The nobles heard the famous chieftain’s words,
        <lb/>And none dissented. Then an elder rose—
        <lb/>Shahrén Guraz, a hoary warrior,
        <lb/>A chieftain eminent—and answered thus :—
        <lb/><q>Thou art a benefactor to the world,
        <pb n="8.240"/>
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1898"/>
        <lb/>Illustrious prince! Hadst thou not been at Rai
        <lb/>No one had matched king Sawa when he reached
        <lb/>Our coast with forces to enslave the Free;
        <lb/>But bravely thou didst arm thee and that trouble
        <lb/>Passed from the Iranians, and a host equipped,
        <lb/>And warriors all, four hundred thousand strong,
        <lb/>Fled from thy wooden shaft, and thus Iran
        <lb/>Had rest from heat and strife; so now its throne
        <lb/>Befitteth thee as thine unsleeping fortune
        <lb/>Is witness. Him that disobeyeth thee,
        <lb/>Or shunneth thine alliance, will we cause
        <lb/>To do thy will, brave though he be, and though
        <lb/>The matter touch Khusrau Parwiz himself.</q>
        <lb/>Thus spake he and resumed his seat, whereat
        <lb/>The chieftain Khurasan stood forth before
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina and thus spake: <q>I ask
        <lb/>This old, ambitious sage, who hath harangued
        <lb/>The assembly at such length, who hath inspired
        <lb/>His words? He praised thee so that all our hearts
        <lb/>Rejoiced, and yet there is a goodly saying
        <lb/>Used in the Zandavasta by Zarduhsht
        <lb/>For honest brains to hear: <q>Whoe’er shall quit
        <lb/>The Almighty’s way, admonish such one year,
        <lb/>Supplying all his needs, and after that
        <lb/>If he return not slay him with the sword
        <lb/>By order of the Shah, while if he be
        <lb/>The just Shah’s foeman let him be beheaded
        <lb/>Forthwith.</q></q>
        <lb/>He spake, ceased, and resumed his seat.
        <lb/>Then Farrukhzad stood up. <q>O helpful chief!</q>
        <lb/>He said, <q>just speech is better than mishap.
        <lb/>If justice then is better perish he
        <lb/>That joyeth in unjust words.</q>
        <lb/>Then he spake
        <lb/>Thus to Bahram Chubina: <q>Blest be thou,
        <lb/>And may the sight of thee sustain the world.
        <pb n="8.241"/>
        <lb/>If these my words find favour and if God,
        <lb/>The Conqueror, assist us live for ever
        <lb/>As our blest Shah, and be the hands and tongues
        <lb/>Of bad men far from thee.</q>
        <lb/>That valiant man
        <lb/>Sat down and Khazarwan, son of Khusrau,
        <lb/>Came forward lion-like and said: <q>Although
        <lb/>Both young and old talk much yet in the end,
        <lb/>If thou wouldst follow right, dispatch like wind
        <lb/>A cameleer and tarry not until
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, the exalted one, shall tread
        <lb/>The longsome road a victim to injustice.
        <lb/>Excuse thy late behaviour and approach not
        <lb/>The throne thus boldly, for no general
        <lb/>Is worthy of it while the world-lord liveth.
        <lb/>If thou art fearful of Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Break off thy love for Pars and Talikan,
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1899"/>
        <lb/>And live in ease and power in Khurasan.
        <lb/>Write letter after letter of excuse;
        <lb/>Perchance Khusrau Parwiz may prove amenable.</q>
        <lb/>When he withdrew stepped forward Zad Farrukh,
        <lb/>And said with justice: <q>Chiefs of noble race!
        <lb/>I have been listening to this debate
        <lb/>Of these the chosen leaders of Iran.
        <lb/>First, that proposal worthy of a slave
        <lb/>To make a paladin the Shah is one
        <lb/>Distasteful to the wise, one to diminish
        <lb/>A man’s renown. The words of Khurasan
        <lb/>Were grand and wedded, I maintain, to wisdom,
        <lb/>While those of Farrukhzad were violent,
        <lb/>Such as would hebetate the hearts of sages.
        <lb/>The fourth to speak was Khazarwan, the chief,
        <lb/>Whose words were also wise, for since God made
        <lb/>The world the course of time is manifest.
        <lb/>Start from Zahhak, the Arab, who was both
        <lb/>Unjust and foul of Faith. He slew Jamshid,
        <pb n="8.242"/>
        <lb/>That overweening one, and seized the world
        <lb/>Unjustly. Holy men grieved that a div
        <lb/>Was Shah till Faridun, that glorious king,
        <lb/>Abated him. Next came that miscreant,
        <lb/>Afrasiyab, who for that purpose left
        <lb/>Turan and crossing o’er the stream beheaded
        <lb/>Naudar, the noble, with the scimitar
        <lb/>In piteous fashion and o’erturned the state;
        <lb/>And, third, Sikandar who from Rum invaded Iran, laid waste our land, and slew Dara,
        <lb/>The swordsman, so that food and slumber grew
        <lb/>Harsh to the Iranians, while, fourthly, came
        <lb/>Foul Khusnavaz who robbed our fields and fells
        <lb/>Of mirth and joy when unexpectedly
        <lb/>The Haitalians slew Piruz, a Shah high-starred,
        <lb/>The conqueror of the world, the chief of rulers,
        <lb/>And overturned the throne of king of kings.
        <lb/>But none hath seen a wonder such as lately
        <lb/>Came on Iran when Shah Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Fled from the throne, from his own troops, to foes!</q>
        <lb/>This said, he sat and wept. Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Turned livid at the words. The veteran
        <lb/>Sambaz, loin-girt, with Indian sword in hand,
        <lb/>Leapt to his feet. <q>This noble paladin,</q>
        <lb/>He said, <q>is great, just, ardent, so till one
        <lb/>Of royal race shall come and gird his loins
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1900"/>
        <lb/>'Tis best for him to sit upon the throne,
        <lb/>For he is warlike, brave, and fortunate.</q>
        <lb/>Bahram Chubina, chief of warriors,
        <lb/>Heard, clapped his hand upon his sword and drew it,
        <lb/>Exclaiming: <q>If we find within this quarter
        <lb/>A woman of the lineage of the Shahs
        <lb/>I will behead her with the trenchant sword,
        <lb/>And let the breath of death pass over her.<note n="2">Couplet inserted from P.</note>
        <pb n="8.243"/>
        <lb/>I will not wait for one to claim the realm,
        <lb/>And caracole amidst the cavaliers.</q>
        <lb/>Whenas the chiefs possessed by Ahriman<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
        <lb/>Heard their foul leader thus assert himself
        <lb/>They drew their scimitars, arose, and spake
        <lb/>In terms unheard till then: <q>Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Is Shah and we are subjects. We will not
        <lb/>Transgress his wishes and commands.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
            <lb/>Now when
            <lb/>Bahram Chubina saw the scimitars
            <lb/>Drawn he did what was just and right, and said :—
            <lb/><q>If any one shall leave his seat and touch
            <lb/>His scimitar I will cut off his hand
            <lb/>Forthwith and sober him.</q>
            <lb/>This said, he left
            <lb/>The nobles for the pleasance. That great conclave
            <lb/>Dispersed with faces lined and broken hearts.
            <lb/>Whenas the pitch-hued, star-illumined Veil
            <lb/>Appeared, and watchmen’s calls were heard, he asked
            <lb/>For pen and paper, and a noble scribe,
            <lb/>And wise, approached, to whom he handed pen
            <lb/>And inkstand, saying: <q>Write out on this silk
            <lb/>This declaration from the Iranians :—<note n="4">Thus imitating the impious Zahhak. See Vol. i. p. 154.</note>
            <lb/><q>Bahram Chubina is the Shah, triumphant,
            <lb/>Deserving crown, adorning throne, and seeking
            <lb/>Right publicly and privily.</q> </q>
            <lb/>This written
            <lb/>They lighted links and passed an anxious night,
            <lb/>But when the Veil of lapis-lazuli
            <lb/>Had passed away and when the world was sun-gilt,
            <lb/>One fortune-favoured came and set a state
            <lb/>Within the palace of Bahram Chubina;
            <lb/>Upon that golden state they placed a seat,
            <lb/>And oped the court. He took his place as Shah,
            <pb n="8.244"/>
            <lb/>And donned the royal crown. The scribe then brought
            <lb/>The declaration of his sovereignty
            <lb/>Inscribed upon the costly painted silk,
            <lb/>And each chief testified: <q>Bahram Chubina
            <lb/>Is monarch of the world.</q>
            <lb/>When they had signed
            <lb/>He sealed it with his golden seal and said :—
            <lb/><q>All-holy God will testify to you
            <lb/>That now this realm is mine and may its kings
            <lb/>Be of my lineage for a thousand years,

            <lb/>Thereafter thus harangued the Iranians :—

            <lb/>Be he an honest man or not, shall spend

            <lb/>Shall go to join Khusrau Parwiz and sleep not
            <lb/>In our dominions longer.</q>
            <lb/>Blessing him,
            <lb/>Not from their hearts, men said: <q>May earth ne’er lack thee.</q>
            <lb/>Heart-broken that Bahram Chubina reigned
            <lb/>Those loyal to the kingdom’s rightful lord
            <lb/>Departed Rum-ward and dispersed abroad.

    <lb/>For seventy days Bandwi, like a cheetah bound,
    <lb/>Was in the prison of Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>Watched by Bahram, the son of Siyavush—
    <lb/>A most unwilling jailor—whom Bandwi,
    <lb/>Still scheming though in bondage, thus beguiled :—
    <lb/><q>Despair not of the monarch of Iran;
    <lb/>Though night be dark ’twill turn to day and though
    <lb/>His fortune, like the fortune of Piruz
    <lb/>With Khushnavaz, shall tarry long. The Maker
    <lb/>Restored him in the person of Kaikubad,<note n="6">Kaikubad in the original.</note>
    <lb/>And gave him back the world. Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>In like wise will retain not crown and throne.
    <lb/>Doth he himself, this man of fortune, think it?
    <lb/>Nay, perish any rustic who thus giveth
    <lb/>Himself in folly to the wind. Count thou
    <lb/>Two months upon thy fingers and thou'lt see
    <lb/>Troops from Iran in Rum, and they will cast
    <lb/>Fire on this crown and throne, and break the jewels
    <lb/>On this man’s head.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram said: <q>If the king
    <lb/>Will grant me quarter I will deck my soul
    <lb/>With thine advice and do thy will in all,
    <lb/>But I must have a great oath sworn to me
    <lb/>By moon, Azargashasp, by throne and crown,
    <lb/>That if Khusrau Parwiz come to our coasts,
    <lb/>And bring a host from Caesar and from Rum,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1902"/>
    <lb/>Thou wilt ask him to spare my life, not slight
    <lb/>What so importeth me, lest he be led
    <pb n="8.246"/>
    <lb/>By what the Iranians say and harm befall me.</q>
    <lb/>He spake, then calling for the Zandavasta
    <lb/>He caused Bandwi to swear, who took the roll,
    <lb/>And said: <q>Let not Bandwi see aught but pain
    <lb/>And toil from the Supreme or e’er find rest
    <lb/>Within this Wayside Hostelry if I
    <lb/>Do otherwise. Else when Khusrau Parwiz
    <lb/>Bestir himself I will not look on him,
    <lb/>Or ever rest, unless he send to thee
    <lb/>Withal a signet and a chieftain’s crown.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram, on hearing what an oath he swore,
    <lb/>And seeing his pure heart and loyalty,
    <lb/>Said: <q>I will tell thee all my schemes aloud.
    <lb/>I will achieve revenge and set a snare
    <lb/>To catch Bahram Chubina. Where I set it
    <lb/>There will I do mine utmost to destroy him
    <lb/>With bane of scimitar. Our streams are dry
    <lb/>Since we have had to hail him as the Shah.</q>
    <lb/>Bandwi replied: <q>Know, O experienced man!
    <lb/>That I am shrewd and prompt and wise, and when
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz returneth with a host
    <lb/>From Rum, and sitteth on the state, thou’lt find
    <lb/>That he will not refuse me anything.
    <lb/>I will ask pardon for thy past offence,
    <lb/>And he would give his crown at my request.
    <lb/>If thou wilt keep thy word and not ensue
    <lb/>Guile in thy heart unfetter me and thus
    <lb/>Begin to recognise Khusrau Parwiz;
    <lb/>Twill prove thy secret bent; that plain appeal
    <lb/>Will reach his ear.</q>
    <lb/>Thereat Bahram’s face brightened,
    <lb/>And he removed the fetters.
    <lb/>When night’s veil,
    <lb/>Musk-hued, turned bright and dawn laid hand thereon
    <lb/>Bahram said to Bandwi: <q>If my heart fail not,
    <lb/>What time Bahram Chubina playeth polo
    <pb n="8.247"/>
    <lb/>To-day I have engaged me with five friends
    <lb/>To slay him.</q>
    <lb/>Calling for a coat of mail
    <lb/>He donned it ’neath his dress and rode away.
    <lb/>Bahram, the warrior, had a wicked wife
    <lb/>Who wished him hewn to pieces. In her heart
    <lb/>She was enamoured of Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>While hatred of her husband filled her soul;
    <lb/>So to Bahram Chubina she dispatched
    <lb/>Someone to say: <q>O thou that succourest!
    <lb/>Protect thyself because Bahram hath donned
    <lb/>His mail beneath his robe and buckled it.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1903"/>
    <lb/>I know not what may be his ill intent,
    <lb/>But thou hadst better keep aloof from him.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing her advice
    <lb/>Not to play polo with her spouse, tapped all
    <lb/>Who came upon the ground with polo-sticks,
    <lb/>And drew anear him, gently on the back
    <lb/>With kindly greetings in a pleasant tone
    <lb/>Until he reached the son of Siyavush,
    <lb/>Found him to be in mail and said: <q>O thou
    <lb/>Worse than a biting snake! who weareth mail
    <lb/>Beneath his silk upon the polo-ground?</q>
    <lb/>This said, he drew his vengeful scimitar,
    <lb/>And clave the son of Siyavush in two.
    <lb/>'Twas bruited in the city that Bahram
    <lb/>Was slain, and when the tidings reached Bandwi
    <lb/>The daylight failed him. Putting on his mail
    <lb/>He mounted, quaking girt his warlike loins,
    <lb/>And taking all the kinsmen of Bahram,
    <lb/>With all that looked for safety to himself,
    <lb/>Fled from the city and the Day of Doom.
    <lb/>When they had gone one stage their numbers grew;
    <lb/>They pressed along the road to Ardabil.
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, when he left the ground,
    <lb/>Trailed in his wrath his robe in blood, then ordered
    <pb n="8.248"/>
    <lb/>Mahrwi to guard Bandwi. The people said:—
    <lb/><q>Fret not for him, O king! for when he heard
    <lb/>News of this slaying verily he took
    <lb/>The wind for waymate, knowing that the matter
    <lb/>Concerned himself and that Bahram was slain
    <lb/>For their intrigue. He sorrowed to have caused
    <lb/>His comrade’s death and saw the outlook dark.</q>
    <lb/>The king said: <q>May he lack both skin and brain
    <lb/>That knoweth not foe from friend. One will repose
    <lb/>Upon the points of elephants’ tusks, another
    <lb/>Trust to the billows of the dark blue sea;
    <lb/>A third will brave a monarch’s wrath, a fourth
    <lb/>Take lion by the foreleg. Let thy soul
    <lb/>Feel for all four; their fortune is averse.
    <lb/>Another would move mountains and inviteth
    <lb/>All to his aid. He wearieth himself,
    <lb/>And as the outcome clutcheth but the wind.
    <lb/>To voyage in a ship unseaworthy
    <lb/>Is better than to be precipitate,
    <lb/>And if thou seekest and dost find a spring
    <lb/>Wilt thou grow daft and turn therefrom in wrath?
    <lb/>The man whose guide is blind will tarry long
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1904"/>
    <lb/>Upon his way. The handler of a dragon
    <lb/>Would die, the dragon ’scape, while pain and death
    <lb/>Are his who eateth bane for trial’s sake,
    <lb/>And yet I did not slay Bandwi at first,

    <pb n="8.249"/>
    <lb/>Bandwi perceived a camp-enclosure pitched,
    <lb/>Saw that it was Mausil’s, found streams and food,
    <lb/>And hurried forward to that fertile spot

    <lb/>And if he contemplateth peace or war.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>How Khusrau Parwiz went toward Rum by the Desert route and how a Hermit told him of the Past and Future</head>

    <p>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz led on in haste where guide,
    <lb/>And grass and water, were not. Slack of rein
    <lb/>They went in dudgeon till they reached Babil,
    <lb/>Where all the well-disposed among the chiefs
    <lb/>Went forth to welcome him. As he drew near
    <lb/>He made his men dismount outside the city,
    <lb/>And scarce had done so when a courier came
    <lb/>Out of Iran in haste. He bore a letter
    <lb/>Concealed upon him from Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>And written to the ruler of Babil :—
    <lb/><q>Detain a company if one shall come;
    <lb/>My troops pursue and will arrive anon.</q>
    <lb/>The ruler, seeing the letter’s purport, sought
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz in haste, who looked and read,
    <lb/>Astounded at the process of the world.
    <lb/>He feared pursuit and mourned his own fatigue,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1905"/>
    <lb/>But mounting presently departed thence,
    <lb/>And girding up his royal loins pressed on
    <pb n="8.250"/>
    <lb/>Until he came to the Farat; no rest
    <lb/>Saw he in his own realm. His followers,
    <lb/>Both old and young, were famished. Then they spied
    <lb/>A wood and water while a caravan
    <lb/>Of camels led on by a cameleer
    <lb/>Appeared anon. That youth, when he beheld
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, called blessings down upon
    <lb/>That noble one, who asked: <q>What is thy name?
    <lb/>What is thy trade and whither goest thou?</q>
    <lb/>He answered: <q>Kais am I, son of Haris,
    <lb/>And heir of Arab chiefs. From Misr have I
    <lb/>Come with a caravan and am myself
    <lb/>Chief cameleer. I dwell beside the waters
    <lb/>Of the Farat and came thence to this forest.</q>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz asked: <q>What hast thou of food
    <lb/>And stuffs, for we are wearied out and famished,
    <lb/>Not having food or packs?</q>
    <lb/>The Arab said :—
    <lb/><q>Stay; I am one with thee, share, soul, and body.</q>
    <lb/>In his affection for the Shah he brought
    <lb/>A fatted cow; they slaughtered her and lit
    <lb/>A fire by kindling sticks both green and dry.
    <lb/>He grilled kabab; the comrades of the Shah
    <lb/>Were eager to partake, consuming much,
    <lb/>But had no bread. Each chieftain then made ready
    <lb/>A sleeping-place. They slept awhile, then rose
    <lb/>And offered up their orisons anew
    <lb/>To that just Judge who made the world, made mighty
    <lb/>And weak alike, and then the Shah addressed
    <lb/>His comrades thus: <q>The most in fault are they
    <lb/>That are my noblest and most famous subjects:
    <lb/>Still those that have done worst, rebelled, and left
    <lb/>God’s way, may trust with confidence to me.
    <lb/>See that ye give to them the fairest hopes.</q>
    <lb/>His comrades blessed him, saying: <q>O thou pure
    <lb/>Of heart and Faith! bright be thy heart and jocund
    <pb n="8.251"/>
    <lb/>Thy lot, and may the just Judge give thee back
    <lb/>The throne. He hath bestowed on thee such Grace
    <lb/>And mien that love and justice are increased
    <lb/>For every one: thou art the sum of wisdom,
    <lb/>For thou replacest ill by good.</q>
    <lb/>The Shah,
    <lb/>Though pleased at this acclaim, was in his heart
    <lb/>Concerned about his route and asked the Arab :—
    <lb/><q>What is it like? How shall I fare with troops?</q>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1906"/>
    <lb/>He answered: <q>Seventy farsangs and more
    <lb/>Of waste and mountain front you. With thy leave
    <lb/>I will find meat and water for the road
    <lb/>If thou wilt hurry not.</q>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
    <lb/>Replied: <q>There is no other course, for this
    <lb/>Will furnish provand and a guide.</q>
    <lb/>The Arab
    <lb/>Dispatched a cameleer to fare before
    <lb/>The troops. He hurried over waste and mountain,
    <lb/>All care and travail, with that company.
    <lb/>Withal afar another caravan
    <lb/>Appeared upon the route before the troops.
    <lb/>A wealthy merchant sought the king, who asked :—
    <lb/><q>Say, whence art thou and whither hastening?</q>
    <lb/>He said: <q>I am a merchant and a scribe,
    <lb/>And I have come from Khurra-i-Ardshir.</q>
    <lb/><q>How did thy father name thee?</q> said the Shah.
    <lb/>The merchantman replied: <q>Mihran Sitad.</q>
    <lb/>The king requested of the man supplies
    <lb/>Because the leader of his troops had said :—
    <lb/><q>He hath, O Shah! provisions past compute,
    <lb/>But may not be best pleased.</q>
    <lb/><q>To find a host
    <lb/>Upon the way is so much to the good,</q>
    <lb/>The Shah replied. The merchant loosed his bales
    <lb/>Of cheap and costly wares, brought provand forth,
    <pb n="8.252"/>
    <lb/>And sat himself upon the ground, invoking
    <lb/>A blessing on the king. The eating done,
    <lb/>The hospitable merchant brought the Shah
    <lb/>The water for his hands, but when Kharrad,
    <lb/>Son of Barzin, saw that he rose, ran up,
    <lb/>Took the warm water from the merchant’s hand,
    <lb/>That no respect toward the Shah might fail,
    <lb/>And when the merchantman made haste to bring
    <lb/>Wine lucent as rose-water then again
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, took from his hand
    <lb/>The goblet and presented it himself.
    <lb/>In due observance servants profit find,
    <lb/>For all such service is repaid in kind.
    <lb/><q>Which is the army’s route,</q> the Shah then asked
    <lb/>The merchant, <q>and, O hospitable man!
    <lb/>Where dwellest thou in Khurra-i-Ardshir?</q>
    <lb/>He said: <q>O Shah! live in prosperity.
    <lb/>I of these traffickers am from Karaz.</q><note n="8"><cit><quote xml:lang="la">Je suis le courtier des marchands.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
    <lb/>The Shah enjoined Ruzbih, the scribe, to note
    <lb/>The young man’s name and village. <q>Go thy ways,
    <lb/>And be at heart the warp and woof of wisdom,</q>
    <lb/>He said. The army left that verdant spot,
    <lb/>And hurrying toward the Ruman marches reached
    <lb/>The town which Cesar named Karsan. The Christians,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1907"/>
    <lb/>On seeing the troops afar, went hurrying
    <lb/>Across the waste to carry their effects
    <lb/>Within the walls and firmly barred the gates.
    <lb/>The Shah, the lustre of the world, chagrined
    <lb/>Remained outside for three days with his troops,
    <lb/>And on the fourth dispatched a man to say :—
    <lb/><q>Our troops are few, send provand, succour us,
    <lb/>And treat us not in this high-handed wise.</q>
    <lb/>They scorned his words, his troops were weak and famished,
    <pb n="8.253"/>
    <lb/>When suddenly there rose a murky cloud,
    <lb/>Which roared like some great warrior-lion; a storm
    <lb/>Swept o’er the place; from every quarter came
    <lb/>Din and acry for help. By midnight half
    <lb/>The walls had gone; the town was all amaze;
    <lb/>The bishop offered prayers; in every quarter
    <lb/>They gathered food together, and three priests,
    <lb/>Three venerable men, went forth in haste
    <lb/>With native produce and with Ruman robes,
    <lb/>And brought a led horse to the Shah. They said :—
    <lb/><q>Our fault, O Shah! is manifest to us,</q>
    <lb/>And he, a noble youth, reproached them not.
    <lb/>There was within the city’s walls a palace,
    <lb/>Whose summit was at home among the clouds;
    <lb/>'Twas built by Cesar and had many slaves.
    <lb/>The Shah went thither when he left the plain,
    <lb/>And oft-times used to go about the city.
    <lb/>The Rumans all acclaimed him and strewed jewels
    <lb/>Beneath his feet. Possessed of this fair dwelling
    <lb/>He rested for a while and wrote to Cesar
    <lb/>Of that storm, rain, and darksome cloud, then went
    <lb/>Toward Manwi which he renamed Minu.<note n="9">i.e., Paradise.</note>
    <lb/>The shrewd and wise, the great and powerful,
    <lb/>Among its citizens, with priests and monks,
    <lb/>Went to the king with gifts and offerings,
    <lb/>Spake of the storm and of that ancient town,<note n="10">Karsan.</note>
    <lb/>And all said: <q>We are slaves and bow before
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz’ behest.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
        <lb/>He stayed three days,
        <lb/>And on the fourth when Sol, the world’s light, rose,
        <lb/>And thrust its bright sword through the clouds, departed
        <lb/>Toward Warigh;<note n="11">Spelled also Aurigh.</note> it was a city’s name,
        <lb/>And had the true Cross<note n="12">Cf. Vol. v. p. 306 and note.</note> and a hospital.
        <pb n="8.254"/>
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1908"/>
        <lb/>Upon the waste he saw a hermitage;
        <lb/>He heard the hermit’s voice, approached, and asked:—
        <lb/><q>What blesséd one is here?</q>
        <lb/>They made reply:—
        <lb/><q>An ancient man grown wan with many years,
        <lb/>A skilled astrologer; there is not aught
        <lb/>Concealed from him, and what he saith will be.</q>
        <lb/>The Shah drew nigh the door forthwith and cried:—
        <lb/><q>Be thine to worship God, and may He bless thee
        <lb/>If thou wilt come forth from thine ancient cell.</q>
        <lb/>Forthwith the hermit, when he heard the words,
        <lb/>Descended from his cell and seeing the Shah
        <lb/>Said: <q>Of a truth thou art Khusrau Parwiz
        <lb/>Brought by the hand of an ill-doing slave,
        <lb/>Impure, Armenian-like, a servitor,
        <lb/>To this affliction for thy father’s throne.</q>
        <lb/>He spake at large; Khusrau Parwiz became
        <lb/>Cheered in his heart through all that kindliness,
        <lb/>And all in wonder at the words invoked
        <lb/>The blessings of the Maker on the man,
        <lb/>The devotee, and, mounted, greeted him
        <lb/>With outstretched hand, whereat the man of God
        <lb/>Did reverence and spake long. By way of proof
        <lb/>The Shah said: <q>Of the Iranian host am I,
        <lb/>A subject, bearing a dispatch to Cesar,
        <lb/>And I shall carry to my lord his answer.
        <lb/>See if my journey will be prosperous,
        <lb/>And how result.</q>
        <lb/>He answered: <q>Say not so;
        <lb/>Thou art the Shah, make not thyself a courtier.
        <lb/>I told thee all at sight so never prove me.
        <lb/>Thy Faith alloweth no falsehood, and deceit
        <lb/>Is not thy way and wont. Thou hast endured
        <lb/>Much toil and suffered, and at last hast fled
        <lb/>Before thy slave.</q>
        </p><p>
        <lb/>Astounded and confused
        <pb n="8.255"/>
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz began to make excuse.
        <lb/>The hermit said: <q>Forbear, and question me
        <lb/>Of what will be. As to thy coming hither
        <lb/>Be glad and confident, and to the world
        <lb/>A fruitful bough for God will satisfy thee,
        <lb/>And give to thee high fortune and high place,
        <lb/>While thou wilt have from Cesar arms and troops,
        <lb/>And daughter worthy of the crown of state.
        <lb/>The World-lord, who ne’er sleepeth, will assist thee
        <lb/>In battle with thy slaves, while in the end
        <lb/>The miscreant will flee and oft recall
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1909"/>
        <lb/>The days of his success. He will alight
        <lb/>Far from that field of battle and there dwell;
        <lb/>Yet still, though rather than submit to thee
        <lb/>He will choose exile, they will shed his blood
        <lb/>At thy behest.</q>
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied:—
        <lb/><q>God grant it, ancient sage! but tell me this:
        <lb/>Will it be long ere I obtain the kingship?</q>
        <lb/>He said: <q>Twelve months and thou wilt have the throne,
        <lb/>Then fifteen days and thou wilt light the world
        <lb/>As king of kings.</q>
        <lb/><q>Who of this company,</q>
        <lb/>The Shah inquired, <q>will bear most toil and care
        <lb/>On mine account?</q>
        <lb/>The hermit said: <q>Bistam,<note n="13">The Arabic form of Gustaham. He was no true Persian and therefore not to be trusted.</note>
        <lb/>A lofty spirit and a prosperous,
        <lb/>And thy maternal uncle who, thou knowest,
        <lb/>Hath made thy lifetime pleasant; but beware
        <lb/>Of that unprofitable man, the source
        <lb/>Of all thy plaints, affliction, and mishap.</q>
        <lb/>The Shah was wroth and said to Gustaham:—
        <lb/><q>Thy name revealeth thee! Thy mother called thee
        <pb n="8.256"/>
        <lb/>Bistam but thou proclaimest in the fight
        <lb/>Thyself a Gustaham!</q>
        <lb/>Then to the hermit:—
        <lb/><q>This is mine uncle on my mother’s side.</q>
        <lb/>The hermit answered: <q>Yea, it is the same;
        <lb/>Thou wilt see pain and strife through Gustaham.</q>
        <lb/><q>And after,</q> said the Shah, <q>what will ensue,
        <lb/>My counsellor?</q>
        <lb/>He answered: <q>Heed not that,
        <lb/>For thenceforth thou wilt have but praise; no ill
        <lb/>E’er will befall thee, and if hardship cometh
        <lb/>'Twill be from God. This rebel will disturb
        <lb/>Thy peace, but after thou wilt be content,
        <lb/>And, bad as this malicious one may prove,
        <lb/>His fate is in thy hands.</q>
        <lb/><q>Be not concerned
        <lb/>Hereat, O king!</q> said Gustaham. <q>By God,
        <lb/>The Holy One, the Maker of the moon,
        <lb/>Who made a Shah like thee to rule the world;
        <lb/>By sun, by moon, and by Azargashasp,
        <lb/>And by the life and head of our famed Shah,
        <lb/>While Gustaham shall live he shall not seek
        <lb/>Aught but the right or knock at evil’s door;
        <lb/>And if he should be minded otherwise
        <lb/>Then may the soul of Gustaham depart.
        <lb/>No human being since the World-lord made
        <lb/>The world hath looked upon His secret’s key;
        <lb/>Why shouldst thou credit then a Christian’s words,
        <lb/>And heed his idle talk? Suspect me not
        <lb/>Through speech of his, and seek not for a pretext
        <lb/>Against me now that I have sworn to thee.</q>
        <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz made answer: <q>Holy men

        <lb/>Speak to the point. Withal I have not seen

        <lb/>When he arrived there came from noble Caesar
        <lb/>A cavalier to say: <q>Ask what thou wilt
        <lb/>Within our coasts and see that thou refrain not
        <lb/>Thy will from kings, for though this realm is mine
        <lb/>I hold thee as mine equal. Stay secure,
        <lb/>And happy in yon city, apprehending
        <lb/>No ill. All Romans, haughty though they are
        <lb/>And chiefs, shall serve thee, and I will not seek
        <lb/>Food, sleep or rest till I have furnished thee
        <lb/>With arms and troops.</q>
        <lb/>The Shah heard and rejoiced;
        <lb/>His soul was eased; he bade call Gustaham,
        <lb/>Badwi, aspiring Andiyan, Kharrad,
        <lb/>Son of Barzin, and lion Shapur, and thus
        <lb/>Spake that brave monarch: <q>Saddle up at dawn
        <lb/>With golden saddles on the horses led,
        <lb/>Put on your tunics gold-inwoven from Chin,
        <lb/>Be one in heart and honesty, depart,
        <lb/>And parle with Caesar. Be ye wary, shrewd,
        <pb n="8.258"/>
        <lb/>Attentive, bland, and courteous. If he goeth
        <lb/>Upon the Ground for archery or polo
        <lb/>Exert you to the utmost ’gainst his chiefs,
        <lb/>For ye must not be worsted: let him know
        <lb/>That horsemanship proceedeth from Iran,
        <lb/>While from its Lions there come might and valour.</q>

        <lb/>The Shah then bade Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
<lb/><q>Bring hither silk from Chin and black musk; I
<lb/>Must write a letter like resplendent Sol
<lb/>In jocund Paradise to Caesar, brief
<milestone unit="calced" n="1911"/>
<lb/>But to the purpose, such as all men’s hearts
<lb/>May recollect. He hath philosophers;
<lb/>Be instant that they hear no foolishness.
<lb/>They measure not their words in anything;
<lb/>Let them not find a fault in our dispatch.
<lb/>When he hath read the letter loose thy tongue;
<lb/>None of them can compete with thee in speech.</q>
<lb/>Then to Badwi: <q>If Caesar speak of us
<lb/>In public with regard to an alliance,
<lb/>Oath, treaty or affinity, reply
<lb/>As sweet as honey for thou art my tongue
<lb/>Before that folk and mine interpreter
<lb/>For good and ill. Endeavour by all means
<lb/>To save us from defeat; be diligent;
<lb/>Take mine assurances and bear in mind
<lb/>My words.</q>
<lb/>Those ardent, veteran warriors
<lb/>Heard the instructions of that glorious youth,
<lb/>And blessed him saying: <q>May none wear the crown
<lb/>But thou.</q>
<lb/>They fared with cheerful hearts to Caesar,
<lb/>Who when he heard: <q>Some nobles of Iran,
<lb/>The envoys of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Have reached Yunan,</q> sent many troops to meet them.
<pb n="8.259"/>
<lb/>He decked a palace with brocade of Rum,
<lb/>The pattern jewelled on a ground of gold,
<lb/>And sitting on the famous ivory throne
<lb/>Assumed the heart-illuming crown and bade
<lb/>Withdraw the curtain and to introduce
<lb/>The envoys from the vestibule, rejoicing.
<lb/>First came the noble Gustaham, behind
<lb/>There were Badwi and brave Shapur, Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, and valiant Andiyan,
<lb/>All crowned and girdle-girt. They came anear
<lb/>To Caesar and on seeing did obeisance,
<lb/>With one consent called blessings down on him,
<lb/>And on that golden throne besprinkled gems.
<lb/>He first inquired about the Shah, Iran,
<lb/>The host and toilsome journey. Hearing this,
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, approached the throne,
<lb/>And brought the letter of the Shah. They set,
<lb/>By order of that noble sovereign,
<lb/>Four golden seats, and of the envoys three,
<lb/>Men of illustrious rank and well advised,
<lb/>Sat down, but still Kharrad, son of Barzin,
<lb/>Stood. Caesar said: <q>A traveller should sit.</q>
<lb/><q>The Shah hath not conferred on me the right,</q>
<lb/>He answered, <q>in thy presence while I hold
<milestone unit="calced" n="1912"/>
<lb/>His letter: mine abasement may commend
<lb/>Itself to thee and aid mine embassage.</q>
<lb/>Said Caesar: <q>Speak. What said the prudent prince?</q>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, what while he spake
<lb/>Observing what Khusrau Parwiz had said,
<lb/>First praised the Maker and besought His help,
<lb/><q>Who is above all height, all wise, all mighty,
<lb/>Who hath revealed heaven’s host and given us
<lb/>Soul, wisdom, love. He bade and heaven was,
<lb/>For He is over space and time. The sphere
<lb/>And stars revolving are His work. When He
<pb n="8.260"/>
<lb/>Created servants out of worthless dust
<lb/>He gave life first to Gayomart. The race
<lb/>Went on to Fereydun whom God most favoured
<lb/>Of all those noble chieftains. Once obscure
<lb/>His stock became illustrious in the world,
<lb/>And lasted up to Kai Kubad who donned
<lb/>The crown of majesty. His race ne’er saw
<lb/>Calamity and ever kept God’s way;
<lb/>But now a worthless slave hath come and sat
<lb/>Upon the royal throne. I seek for justice
<lb/>Against the unjust, not crown, throne, cap, and girdle.
<lb/>Whoever sitteth on a throne hath need
<lb/>Of wisdom, fortune, and nobility.
<lb/>This man shall learn to whom the fortune, Grace,
<lb/>And diadem of king of kings pertain.
<lb/>Help me and quell this traitor for I roam
<lb/>Despised by small and great.</q>
<lb/>When Caesar heard
<lb/>His cheeks became like bloom of fenugreek;
<lb/>That bloom of fenugreek grew charged with hail,
<lb/>And from his tongue and soul there burst a wail.

    <lb/>Above my kindred and my fluent soul,
    <lb/>Is not a secret with discerning men.
    <pb n="8.261"/>
    <lb/>I have arms, troops, and treasure. Now consider
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1913"/>
    <lb/>What ye require. If he will have mine eyes
    <lb/>I will not say him nay though they are better
    <lb/>Than wealth, dinars, and sword.</q>
    <lb/>Then Caesar summoned
    <lb/>A well-experienced scribe and, seating him
    <lb/>Upon the royal dais, bade him write
    <lb/>An answer decked like meads of Paradise
    <lb/>With many a counsel, promise, and kind word
    <lb/>About past times and present. When the scribe
    <lb/>Had finished Caesar chose a cavalier
    <lb/>Brave, fluent, ardent, and of heedful mind,
    <lb/>Wise, learned, a warrior, and scribe withal,
    <lb/>And said: <q>Go to Khusrau Parwiz and say:—
    <lb/><q>Thou seeker of God’s way, shrewd-hearted Shah!
    <lb/>I have men, arms, and treasure, and no need
    <lb/>To trouble any one but, if need were,
    <lb/>Would requisition drachms from every lord
    <lb/>Throughout the realm that thou mightst have thy wish,
    <lb/>And go hence to thine own home in Iran.
    <lb/>Grieve not while here, ’tis circling heaven’s way,
    <lb/>Which is by turns our refuge and our bale,
    <lb/>By turns our loss and profit. While I find
    <lb/>Arms, troops, and money do thou take thine ease.</q></q>
    <lb/>The envoy went and told Khusrau Parwiz.

        <p>
        <lb/>Then Caesar cleared the audience-room and sat
        <lb/>Deliberating with his counsellor,
        <lb/>And said thus to that priest: <q>This suppliant
        <pb n="8.262"/>
        <lb/>Hath made choice of ourselves to refuge with:
        <lb/>What shall we do that he may gather strength,
        <lb/>And feel no more his subject’s insolence?</q>
        <lb/>The counsellor thus answered: <q>What we need
        <lb/>Is that a few shrewd-hearted men of those
        <lb/>That are our well-advised philosophers
        <lb/>Shall act with us herein.</q>
        <lb/>So famous Caesar
        <lb/>Dispatched a messenger and four arrived
        <lb/>Of those philosophers, two young, two old,
        <lb/>All Roman-born, and thus they spake at large:—
        <lb/><q>The Iranians, since Alexander passed away,
        <lb/>Have deeply wounded us by frequent raiding,
        <lb/>By war and strife, and causeless, reckless bloodshed;
        <lb/>Now holy God requiteth their ill deeds
        <lb/>In kind. Since the Sassanians’ fortune halteth
        <lb/>Forbear to intervene. Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>If he shall gain the royal crown and raise
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1914"/>
        <lb/>His forehead to the moon, will ask for tribute
        <lb/>From Rome anon and trample on our land.
        <lb/>Reflect if this be wise. Hold their words wind.</q>
        <lb/>When Caesar heard he changed his mind and sent
        <lb/>The Shah a letter by a cavalier
        <lb/>To tell what course the sages had advised
        <lb/>In long debate. He reached Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>And told what he had heard the famed king say,
        <lb/>Delivered Caesar’s letter too and uttered
        <lb/>Words past compute. Khusrau Parwiz grew strait
        <lb/>Of heart thereat, his face turned wan with care.
        <lb/>He thus replied: <q>If we must lay to heart
        <lb/>All that can be alleged from days of yore
        <lb/>Then all our travail will but catch the wind.
        <lb/>Consider now if my progenitors,
        <lb/>Those chosen world-lords, men of holiness,
        <lb/>Made wars with justice or unjustly; ask
        <lb/>Of ancient men who bear such things in mind.
        <pb n="8.263"/>
        <lb/>Vouchsafe to question the wise men of Rome
        <lb/>If 'twas the crow or owl that did the wrong.<note n="15">Alluding to a story in the book of Kalila and Dimna (see Vol. vii., p. 382). The owls, having an ancient grudge against the crows, one of whom had prevented the owl from being elected the king of the cranes, made a treacherous night-attack upon the crows. A counsellor of the king of the crows, acting somewhat as an Hephtalite chief is said to have done in the war against Piruz (id. p. 161), succeeded in avenging them.</note>
        <lb/>Although the Maker hath not left in want
        <lb/>The Great of Rome mine ancestors withal
        <lb/>Were men of name, in their own days supreme,
        <lb/>Who were no brookers of insurgency,
        <lb/>Pride, wrong, or foolishness from any one;
        <lb/>But what can this avail now that my head
        <lb/>Is in the dragon’s maw? Greet Caesar for me,
        <lb/>And say: <q>The Great speak only to the point
        <lb/>In wisdom’s presence though both good and ill
        <lb/>Pass in the end. I will not rest till I
        <lb/>Have drawn my skirt forth from this turbid stream,
        <lb/>And if the Romans will not succour me
        <lb/>I will send envoys to the Khan. My words
        <lb/>Have naught availed because my river-bed
        <lb/>Was fouled, and when my messengers return
        <lb/>My sojourn in this city will be short.</q></q>
        <lb/>He said to the Iranians: <q>Obey
        <lb/>My hests; let not this matter break your hearts,
        <lb/>For God, the Conqueror, is aiding us;
        <lb/>Our part is fortitude and manliness.</q>
        <lb/>He took the matter lightly and dispatched
        <lb/>His answer by Tukhar. He wrote as though
        <lb/>He recked not either good or ill. Tukhar
        <lb/>Departed from Khusrau Parwiz and came
        <lb/>To where was Caesar’s court, that man of name.

            <lb/>Now Caesar having read the letter pondered,

            <lb/>Will be successful or will writhe at fortune.
            <lb/>If ye shall say: <q>He will not be victorious,
            <lb/>Henceforth there is no New Year’s Day for him,</q>
            <lb/>Then will we let him journey to the Khan,
            <lb/>And go, since he is ailing, to that cure;
            <lb/>But if he is to triumph and possess
            <lb/>The kingship, like his father, it were well
            <lb/>In all ways that he go hence with a host,
            <lb/>And so not contemplate revenge at heart.</q>
            <pb n="8.264"/>
            <lb/>The prudent minister, on hearing this,
            <lb/>Gave orders and the readers of the stars
            <lb/>Came with their ancient tablets and consulted
            <lb/>Until three watches of the night had passed,
            <lb/>And in conclusion an astrologer
            <lb/>Spake thus to Caesar: <q>O illustrious!
            <lb/>I have consulted these old tables made
            <lb/>In astrologic wise by Plato.
            <lb/>Ere long Khusrau Parwiz will have the realm,

            <lb/>Receive him not for eight and thirty years.</q>
            <lb/>Thereat said Caesar to his minister:—
            <lb/><q>Our doubts are cleared about Khusrau Parwiz.
            <lb/>What shall we say? What answer shall we give?</q>
            <pb n="8.265"/>
            <lb/><q>Let us apply a salve,</q> he made reply.

            <lb/>And levy soldiers elsewhere than in Rome,

            <lb/>In compassing thy will.</q>
            <lb/><q>We must,</q> said Caesar,
            <lb/><q>Dispatch him troops forthwith. When all is weighed
            <lb/>'Tis well to hold wealth cheap and keep from harm.</q>
            <lb/>He wrote forthwith, bestowing praise on praise:—
            <lb/><q>We have consulted loyal, honest priests
            <lb/>On all points bad and good, and have returned,
            <lb/>Discussion over, to our former view.

            <lb/>This pricking with a fleam the lion’s jaws,
            <lb/>Arose from sages’ tales about the past,
            <lb/>How under Shah Shapur, son of Ardshir,
            <lb/>Our youths’ hearts aged with toil, much ravaging,

            <lb/>Were nine and thirty turned to bramble-brakes
            <lb/>By the Iranians, and the waste became
            <lb/>Filled with the blood of chiefs whose wives and children
            <lb/>Were carried captive; so thou must not marvel
            <lb/>If Romans mused revenge. Howbeit to owe
            <lb/>A grudge is not according to our Faith,

            <lb/>And God forbid that we should practise ill.
            <lb/>We know no better thing than uprightness,

            <lb/>We have convoked the chiefest sufferers,

            <lb/>Their evil passions have been charmed away,

            <lb/>Thus then have we secured that none will use

            <lb/>And pledge our lives to further thy commands.
            <lb/>Thou too must pledge thy word that none will bear

            <lb/>I will not think your labours slight or mean,

                <lb/>Writ in mine own hand known throughout the world,

                <lb/>That what I say is true my heart and star,

                <lb/>All being said, he gave
                <lb/>The letter to Khurshid, son of Kharrad.
                <lb/>As swift as wind that chieftain rose and mounting

                <pb n="8.271"/>
                <lb/>And gave the message of Khusrau Parwiz.
                <lb/>Then Caesar, having snapped the band and read
                <lb/>The words of that exalted Shah, commanded
                <lb/>The wise men and the eloquent to meet
                <lb/>Before him and inquired of them in turn:—
                <lb/><q>What cure shall I adopt? How shall I make
                <lb/>A treaty with the monarch of Iran?
                <lb/>His letter leaveth us without excuse;
                <lb/>All we of Rome and of Iran are one.</q>
                <lb/>The chiefs and sages rose to answer him,
                <milestone unit="calced" n="1920"/>
                <lb/>And said: <q>We are but subjects; thou art Caesar,
                <lb/>The world-lord throned and crowned. Do thou advise,
                <lb/>Who hast both counsel and authority:
                <lb/>Our bodies and our souls are thine.</q>
                <lb/>When Caesar
                <lb/>Heard he commended those shrewd, pious chiefs,
                <lb/>And waited till in the revolving sky
                <lb/>The lamp of day had lost its radiancy.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><head>How Caesar made a Talisman and deceived the Envoys of Khusrau Parwiz, and how Kharrad, Son of Barzin, solved the Mystery</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>When circling Sol grew pale, and in the tower
    <lb/>Of night the stars were stationed, Caesar bade
    <lb/>His warlocks muse and frame a talisman—
    <lb/>A marvel—somewhere, such as none would know
    <lb/>From real—a woman modest, fair, and seated
    <lb/>In trailing raiment on a goodly throne
    <lb/>With handmaids on both sides of her and slaves
    <lb/>Before her and behind. She was to sit,
    <pb n="8.272"/>
    <lb/>That moon-faced one in silence, to appear
    <lb/>A woman weeping, and from time to time
    <lb/>To raise one hand and dash her tears away.
    <lb/>The warlocks, as they were instructed, made
    <lb/>The semblance of a woman with long hair,
    <lb/>And all that from a distance gazed thereon
    <lb/>Took it to be a woman lovelorn, bright,
    <lb/>That sorely wept o’er Christ, her cheeks aflame,
    <lb/>Her lashes like Spring-clouds. When of the adepts
    <lb/>That talisman was set up in its place
    <lb/>One went and said to Caesar: <q>We have finished
    <lb/>The matter in accord to what thou badest.</q>
    <lb/>When he had heard this from the expert, Caesar
    <lb/>Came from his throne in haste and visited
    <lb/>The talisman. He marvelled at that feat
    <lb/>Of sorcery and sent for Gustaham.
    <lb/>He bounteously rewarded those magicians
    <lb/>With money and with divers other gifts,
    <lb/>Then said to Gustaham: <q>Famed warrior!
    <lb/>I had a daughter beautiful as Spring:
    <lb/>She grew up to a marriageable age.
    <lb/>I had a kinsman, an aspiring one,
    <lb/>To whom I married her with Christian rites.
    <lb/>I countenanced him unadvisedly,
    <lb/>And sent her to his palace. That youth’s soul
    <lb/>Hath gone to Heaven; she is deeply grieved;
    <lb/>Bright day for her is lapis-lazuli;
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1921"/>
    <lb/>She will not take my rede or speak a word,
    <lb/>And our young world hath agéd through her trouble.
    <lb/>Concern thyself to see her, and employ
    <lb/>The words of men of lore, for thou art wise,
    <lb/>A paladin by race, and she may speak
    <lb/>To thee.</q>
    <lb/>He said: <q>I will: it may be I
    <lb/>Shall banish this affection from her breast.</q>
    <lb/>With cheerful heart and charged with potent words
    <pb n="8.273"/>
    <lb/>That chief approached the guileful talisman,
    <lb/>Which bowed to greet him as he neared its throne.
    <lb/>Illustrious Gustaham sat humbly down,
    <lb/>And spake to that sad dame, beginning boldly
    <lb/>With such advice as seemed to him of profit:—
    <lb/><q>O daughter born of Caesar’s race!</q> he said,
    <lb/><q>The wise exclaim not at the course of nature:
    <lb/>The flying eagles, lions in the forests,
    <lb/>And fishes in the waters, are not free
    <lb/>From death,</q> but all his words were wind; no soul,
    <lb/>Or tongue had she but ever and anon
    <lb/>Would dash away the tear-drops from her eyes
    <lb/>As her physician talked. While Gustaham
    <lb/>Was lost in wonder Caesar summoned him,
    <lb/>And asked: <q>How didst thou find that child of mine,
    <lb/>Whose pain and mourning cause me this distress?</q>
    <lb/>He answered: <q>I advised her much but vainly.</q>
    <lb/>The following day said Caesar to Balwi:—
    <lb/><q>Go thou with Andiyan. Shapur withal,
    <lb/>The nobly born, may help to make my heart
    <lb/>Glad in my daughter. Go to that sorrower,
    <lb/>And speak to her about the famous king.
    <lb/>She that is heaping fire upon my head
    <lb/>May answer thee. Be good enough to aid me
    <lb/>By converse with my mourning child; perchance
    <lb/>In view of your high rank she may accept
    <lb/>Your counsels. Sure I am that she will speak
    <lb/>To-day, and when she maketh fair reply
    <lb/>I shall be freed from this disconsolate,
    <lb/>Who raineth tears of blood upon her breast.</q>
    <lb/>Then those three noble Persians went to her,
    <lb/>And each one strove, but answer gat they none;
    <lb/>That tongueless dame was mute. The baffled three
    <lb/>Went back to Caesar, that just judge, and said:—
    <lb/><q>We spake and gave advice as best we could,
    <lb/>But there was no improvement.</q>
    <pb n="8.274"/>
    <lb/><q>'Tis ill hap
    <lb/>For us,</q> he said, <q>to grieve for one in grief.</q>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1922"/>
    <lb/>Since these great men had failed he had recourse
    <lb/>To great Kharrad, son of Barzin. <q>Thou art,</q>
    <lb/>He said, <q>one of these chiefs and thou mayst hear
    <lb/>Her voice forthwith,</q> then sent him to the mourner
    <lb/>From court attended by a trusty servant.
    <lb/>When he arrived he looked upon the mien
    <lb/>Of that crowned form and waited in its presence
    <lb/>No little while. The guileful talisman
    <lb/>Made him a bow of greeting. He observed
    <lb/>The woman, head and foot, most heedfully,
    <lb/>And marked the attendants standing round. He spake
    <lb/>At large; she answered not a word; that man,
    <lb/>That scion of the chiefs, grew full of thought.
    <lb/><q>If grief hath robbed her of her wits,</q> he said,
    <lb/><q>Why do her servants hold their peace the while?
    <lb/>If these be very tear-drops from her eyes
    <lb/>One would expect her passion to abate.
    <lb/>She letteth fall the drops upon her breast,
    <lb/>And knoweth not to move to left or right;
    <lb/>Her tears fall on one spot; she hath not used
    <lb/>One hand or stirred a foot! Had this form life
    <lb/>She would move more than foot or hand, would shed
    <lb/>Her tears, and stretch her other hand, elsewhere.
    <lb/>I see life stir not in her body; 'tis
    <lb/>A talisman of these philosophers.</q>
    <lb/>He came to Caesar with a smile and said:—
    <lb/><q>This moon-faced lady is not rational;
    <lb/>It is a talisman of Roman make,
    <lb/>And hath deceived Balwi and Gustaham.
    <lb/>Thy purpose was to laugh at us or charm
    <lb/>Our eyes. Our Shah when he shall hear will smile
    <lb/>With open lips and show his silvern teeth.</q>
    <lb/>Said Caesar: <q>Live for ever! Thou art fit
    <pb n="8.275"/>
    <lb/>To be the minister of kings. I have
    <lb/>A wondrous chamber in my palace, one
    <lb/>Cannot imagine aught more marvellous.
    <lb/>When thou beholdest it thou wilt not know
    <lb/>Its secret—talisman or work divine.</q>
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, on hearing this,
    <lb/>Went to that ancient chamber and beheld
    <lb/>A cavalier upstanding, poised in air,
    <lb/>And going back to famous Caesar said:—
    <lb/><q>The cavalier is iron and the chamber
    <lb/>Withal is fashioned of the famous ore
    <lb/>Called loadstone by the sages. Those of Rome
    <lb/>Have mounted him upon an Indian steed.
    <lb/>Whoe’er shall read the Indians’ books will find
    <lb/>Both pleasure and enlightenment of mind.</q>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><head>How Kharrad, Son of Barzin, expounded the Faith of the Indians and exhorted Caesar</head>
        <p><milestone unit="calced" n="1923"/>
        <lb/><q>In what regard,</q> said Caesar, <q>do the Indians
        <lb/>Err from the Path? Those that are worshippers,
        <lb/>Are they idolaters or what are they?</q>
        <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, replied: <q>In India
        <lb/>They worship ox and moon, put not their trust
        <lb/>In God and circling heaven, and regard not
        <lb/>Their persons, look no higher than the sun,
        <lb/>And reckon not men like ourselves as wise.
        <lb/>Whoever kindleth fire, shall enter it,
        <lb/>And shall consume himself therein, believeth
        <lb/>That in the air there is a fire ordained
        <lb/>By God, whose word is law, which fire the sage
        <lb/>Of India entitleth 'Ether' and hath much
        <pb n="8.276"/>
        <lb/>Of worth and interest to say thereon,
        <lb/>As thus: when earthly and etherial fires
        <lb/>Combine man’s sin is purged; they must be kindled
        <lb/>Since burning is accounted righteousness.
        <lb/>Withal ye too speak not aright; hereto
        <lb/>Christ’s life is testimony. Mark’st thou not
        <lb/>What Jesus, son of Mary, said when he
        <lb/>Was bringing secret things to light? <q>If one
        <lb/>Shall take thy skirt from thee resist him not,
        <lb/>And if one buffet thee upon the face,
        <lb/>So that thine eyes are darkened by the blows,
        <lb/>Be not enraged or let thy cheek turn pale,
        <lb/>But shut thine eyes and speak no chilling word.
        <lb/>If thou hast little food let it suffice,
        <lb/>And if thou hast no carpet seek one not.
        <lb/>Hold not this kind of evil to be bad,
        <lb/>And ye without a pang will quit this Gloom.</q>
        <lb/>But now with you desire is king o’er wisdom,
        <lb/>Your hearts have erred through overweening greed,
        <lb/>For ye have raised your palaces to Saturn,
        <lb/>And camels bear your treasuries’ keys. Besides
        <lb/>The treasures ye have mighty hosts with coats
        <lb/>Of mail from 'Ad and Roman helms. Ye lead
        <lb/>Hosts everywhere unjustly and allow not
        <lb/>Your swords to rest. The wilderness is all
        <lb/>One fount of blood: Christ led you not to this.
        <lb/>He was a poor, unfurnished man who earned
        <lb/>His bread by toil and lived on curds and milk
        <lb/>With butter for his only other food.
        <lb/>Now when the Jews gat hold of him and saw
        <lb/>Him friendless and without resource they slew him,
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1924"/>
        <lb/>And having slain him set him on the gibbet
        <lb/>To make thereby his Faith contemptible.
        <lb/>His father was an ancient man, his mother
        <pb n="8.277"/>
        <lb/>A temple-keeper and a trier out
        <lb/>Of good and ill. Grown ardent and desirous
        <lb/>Of knowledge, eloquent, instructed, mindful,
        <lb/>He made withal disciples by his teaching,
        <lb/>And compassed in his youth his will by shrewdness.
        <lb/>Thou sayest that he was God’s son and smiled
        <lb/>When slain upon the gibbet! At such things
        <lb/>The sage doth smile. If thou art wise fear God,
        <lb/>Who hath no need of consort and of son,
        <lb/>And unto whom all mysteries are clear.
        <lb/>Why turn’st thou from the Faith of Gayomart,
        <lb/>The path and precedent of Tahmuras,
        <lb/>Which tell us that the Judge of earth is One,
        <lb/>And that our only course is serving Him?
        <lb/>The experienced thane and worshipper of God,
        <lb/>When muttering prayer he taketh in his hand
        <lb/>The sacred twigs, may taste no drop of water
        <lb/>Albeit for very thirst he dream thereof;
        <lb/>He trusteth God upon the day of battle,
        <lb/>And asketh not cold water in the fight.
        <lb/>Withal he taketh for his cynosure
        <lb/>The highest element which is above
        <lb/>Earth, air, and water. Our Shahs barter not
        <lb/>Their Faith but list to Him, the Lord of all.
        <lb/>They joy not in dinars and gems but seek
        <lb/>To make their name and mark by justice only,
        <lb/>By gifts of lofty palaces or joying
        <lb/>The hearts of mourners. Fourthly, they pronounce
        <lb/>None wise but one that on the day of battle
        <lb/>Doth veil the bright sun’s face with dust and guardeth
        <lb/>The land from foes. Be curses his, not blessings,
        <lb/>That seeketh from religion aught but right.</q>
       
        <lb/>When Caesar heard this he approved; the words
        <pb n="8.278"/>
        <lb/>Seemed profitable to him, and he said:—
        <lb/><q>The Maker made thee foremost of the great;
        <lb/>One needs must hearken to thy pure discourse.
        <lb/>Thou hast the key that openeth the door
        <lb/>Of mysteries. The head of one with liege
        <lb/>Like this is higher than the moon’s own crown.</q>
        <lb/>Then from his treasury he bade to bring
        <lb/>Dinars and drachms and a crown magnifical,
        <lb/>Bestowed them on Kharrad, son of Barzin,
        <lb/>And uttered many praises: <q>May the country

            <lb/>Now Caesar, when he heard that troops had come,
            <lb/>And that the world was black with horsemen’s dust,
            <lb/>Chose from those Romans five-score thousand men,
            <lb/>All famed in battle, requisitioned arms,
            <lb/>War-steeds and drachms, and thus much time elapsed.
            <lb/>He had one daughter Maryam hight, wise, grave,
            <lb/>Well counselled and resolved, and later on
            <lb/>Brought forth such stores of bridal bravery
            <lb/>That e’en the speedy baggage-beasts grew slow—
            <lb/>Gold trinkets, jewels that a king might wear,
            <lb/>Gems, gold-embroidered raiment, carpetings,
            <lb/>Brocade of Rome with golden patterns wrought
            <lb/>Upon a ground of silk, torques, bracelets, earrings,
            <lb/>And three most costly and bejewelled crowns.
            <lb/>He had four gilded litters too made ready,
            <lb/>Their curtains decorate with royal gems,
            <lb/>And forty others made of ebony
            <pb n="8.279"/>
            <lb/>All jewelled like the eye of chanticleer.
            <lb/>Then came three hundred moon-faced waiting-maids
            <lb/>All colour and perfume, five hundred slave-boys
            <lb/>Intelligent and bright with ornaments
            <lb/>Of gold and silver, forty Roman eunuchs
            <lb/>Fay-faced, illustrious, attractive men,
            <lb/>And four of the philosophers of Rome,
            <lb/>Wise, learned and famed. He gave them their instructions,
            <lb/>And privily withal charged Maryam
            <lb/>To be obedient, order her desires,
            <lb/>To do her duty, to be bountiful,
            <lb/>As to her food and how to bear herself.
            <lb/>There was, as reckoned in the Roman way,
            <lb/>More than three hundred millions’ worth of goods.
            <lb/>To every envoy at his court he gave
            <lb/>A crown inlaid with jewels, robes withal,
            <lb/>Steeds and dinars and much of all things fitting.
            <lb/>He bade write to the Shah on painted silk:—
            <lb/><q>Well may they raise their necks up to the moon,
            <lb/>These subjects of the Shah! No man more courteous
            <lb/>Than Gustaham hath sprung from small or great.
            <lb/>Is there a champion like the chief Shapur
            <lb/>To act as arbiter? Balwi withal
            <lb/>Can keep a secret for he would not sell
            <lb/>His folk for aught, while none though he live long

            <lb/>This written, he summoned
            <lb/>His counsellors and readers of the stars

            <lb/>And started on Bahram with favouring stars
            <lb/>And auguries. He went himself three stages,

            <lb/>And then resigned the conduct of the host,
            <lb/>Bade Maryam come to him, conversed with her

            <lb/>Thy girdle till thou comest to Iran.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz must see thee not unveiled
            <lb/>Till then or things unlooked for may befall thee,</q>
            <lb/>Then bade her tenderly farewell: <q>May heaven

            <lb/>In Faith. I charge thee with her, with this wealth,

            <lb/>Niyatus
            <lb/>Accepted all from Caesar who, this said,
            <lb/>Turned back in tears. The host marched toward

            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, on hearing that the host
            <lb/>Had come, set out with forces from that city,
            <lb/>And when the leaders’ dust-clouds and the flags

            <lb/>The troops came onward cloud-like, lapped in iron,
            <lb/>In helmet and cuirass, his heart laughed out,
            <lb/>Like Spring-tide roses, at that fine array;
            <lb/>He plucked up heart and gave his steed the heel.
            <lb/>He saw, embraced, and greeted Niyatus,
            <lb/>And testified his gratitude to Caesar,
            <lb/>Who had endured such toil and with that toil

            <lb/>Saluted her and kissed her hand, rejoicing
            <lb/>To look upon the Fair. He bore her off
            <pb n="8.281"/>
            <lb/>To his encampment where he gave his Moon
            <lb/>A bower and passed three days in converse with her.
            <lb/>Upon the fourth when Sol, the world’s light, shone
            <lb/>They got in readiness a choice pavilion,
            <lb/>And summoned Niyatus, Sarkab, and Kut,
            <lb/>The bold, with other chiefs both great and small,
            <lb/>Whom thus the Shah addressed: <q>What chiefs and warriors
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1927"/>
            <lb/>Are here, such men as brandish sword and mace,
            <lb/>In battle reck not of their lives, and turn not
            <lb/>From lion or from leopard in the fray?</q>
            <lb/>Then Niyatus made choice of seventy men
            <lb/>To lead in fight; each had beneath his banner
            <lb/>A thousand chosen, lance-armed cavaliers.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz beheld this picked array
            <lb/>Of noble horsemen eager for the strife;
            <lb/>He praised the Maker of heaven, time, and earth,
            <lb/>He praised too Niyatus, his troops withal,
            <lb/>And noble Caesar and his realm, and said:—
            <lb/><q>If God almighty aid me in this war
            <lb/>I will display my puissance and make
            <lb/>Earth like a sea for jewels; ye shall joy
            <lb/>At having come and rather tell thereof
            <lb/>Than hold your peace: heaven’s airs shall breathe love-fraught
            <lb/>From pleasance, friendship be our only thought.</q>

            <p>
            <lb/>Upon the seventh day that comely Shah
            <lb/>Arrayed his host as ’twere the turning sky,
            <lb/>The din of tymbals went up from the court,
            <pb n="8.282"/>
            <lb/>And air grew ebon with the dust of troops.
            <lb/>He chose a force of Persians and set out
            <lb/>Toward Azar Abadagan. There passed
            <lb/>Two weeks what while by order of the Shah
            <lb/>The soldiers concentrated at his camp.
            <lb/>He pitched it on the plain of Dik; the army
            <lb/>Was great and under Roman discipline.
            <lb/>He gave the whole host up to Niyatus,
            <lb/>Thus saying: <q>Thou art master of the flock,</q>
            <lb/>And thence with certain valiant cavaliers
            <lb/>Let his swift steed have rein and made toward
            <lb/>Khanjast—an anxious journey—till he reached
            <lb/>Mausil, the Armenian, who could hold his own
            <lb/>Among the great and had with him Bandwi,
            <lb/>The Shah’s maternal uncle. Now these twain,
            <lb/>On hearing that Khusrau Parwiz was stirring,
            <lb/>Sped from the waste to meet him on the way,
            <lb/>Preceding their own troops. To Gustaham
            <lb/>The Shah said, seeing them upon the road:—
            <lb/><q>O warrior! two are hurrying o’er the field:
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1928"/>
            <lb/>See who they are and wherefore in such haste.</q>
            <lb/>He answered: <q>Sure am I, O king! that he
            <lb/>Who rideth on the piebald is my brother,
            <lb/>The brave Bandwi: his friend is not of us.</q>
            <lb/>The Shah said: <q>What! How canst thou know him? Nay,
            <lb/>Seek him in ward if living and if slain
            <lb/>Upon a gibbet in the riding-ground.</q>
            <lb/>Said Gustaham: <q>O Shah! regard him well
            <lb/>From this side: ’tis thine uncle: let me die
            <lb/>For saying so if it prove otherwise.</q>
            <lb/>Afoot the twain approached the shady spot
            <lb/>Where was the Shah, praised him and did obeisance.
            <lb/>He gave Bandwi a welcome and observed:—
            <lb/><q>I said that I should find thee hid in dust.</q>
            <lb/>He told the Shah all that had chanced to him,
            <pb n="8.283"/>
            <lb/>His ruse of putting on the royal robes,
            <lb/>And all Bahram Chubina’s clemency.
            <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz wept greatly at the tale,
            <lb/>Then asked him: <q>Who is this?</q>
            <lb/><q>O sun-faced Shah!
            <lb/>Hast thou no kindly welcome for Mausil?</q>
            <lb/>He answered. <q>Since thou left’st Iran for Rome
            <lb/>He hath not slept in lands inhabited,
            <lb/>But camped upon the plain, his palace been
            <lb/>Tent and pavilion. The troops with him
            <lb/>Are many; he hath all the gear of greatness,
            <lb/>With drachms and treasures. Now he hath been waiting
            <lb/>Upon the road and longed for thy return.</q>
            <lb/><q>How came it,</q> asked the world-lord of Mausil,
            <lb/><q>That all thy toil was hidden? We will strive
            <lb/>To give thee happy days and make thy name
            <lb/>The greatest of the great.</q>
            <lb/>Mausil replied:—
            <lb/><q>Give me new life, O king! Let me approach
            <lb/>And kiss thy stirrup while I praise thy Grace
            <lb/>And splendour.</q>
            <lb/><q>For these words,</q> replied the Shah,
            <lb/><q>I will make bright thy gains to pay thy pains,
            <lb/>Will grant thy wish and set thy name on high
            <lb/>Above the great.</q>
            <lb/>Then he withdrew one foot
            <lb/>Out of the stirrup, and that ardent soul,
            <lb/>All eagerness, kissed foot and stirrup both,
            <lb/>O’ercome by veneration for the Shah,
            <lb/>Who, when that loyal liege was satisfied,
            <lb/>Bade him remount and urged his own steed on
            <lb/>Across that barren waste until he reached
            <milestone unit="calced" n="1929"/>
            <lb/>Azargashasp. With muttered prayer he entered
            <lb/>The Fire-fane, with an aching heart. A priest,
            <lb/>The Zandavasta in his hand, approached
            <pb n="8.284"/>
            <lb/>The pious Shah who, loosing from his loins
            <lb/>His golden belt, flung jewels on the Fire,
            <lb/>And in his prayers outdid the priest himself.
            <lb/><q>Just Judge!</q> he said, <q>bring my foes’ heads to dust.
            <lb/>Thou knowest that I justly plead and purpose
            <lb/>To keep the path of good. Approve not Thou
            <lb/>The injustice of the unjust.</q>
            <lb/>This said, he girt
            <lb/>His golden belt and sought the plain of Dik
            <lb/>With wounded heart in trouble for his way:
            <lb/>Night fell ere he reached camp.
            <lb/>He sent shrewd spies
            <lb/>To learn the posture of the world’s affairs,
            <lb/>And when the army of Nimruz had heard:—
            <lb/><q>The Shah, the lustre of the world, hath come,</q>
            <lb/>They bound the drums upon the elephants,
            <lb/>And earth became as ’twere the river Nile.
            <lb/>All folk at that intelligence, which made
            <lb/>Them young again, drew near to give him aid.

    <lb/>The Shah surveyed his host, the right and left,
    <lb/>The centre and the wings. The tymbals sounded
    <lb/>From both sides and the eager warriors
    <lb/>Advanced to fight. <q>Earth is an iron mountain,</q>
    <lb/>Thou wouldst have said, <q>heaven lost in foemen’s dust!</q>
    <lb/>Now when Khusrau Parwiz saw matters thus,
    <lb/>Saw heaven as woof and earth as warp, he prayed
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1933"/>
    <lb/>Thus in the olden tongue: <q>O Thou more pure,
    <lb/>And higher than the high! who but Thyself,
    <lb/>O holy Judge! can tell which will return
    <lb/>Exulting from the fight to-day? The spear
    <lb/>Of him whose fortune halteth hath but thorn
    <lb/>Or weed for point.</q>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was full
    <lb/>Of care, both heart and soul; the world appeared
    <lb/>A brake to him, for from among the troops
    <lb/>Kut, like a dark hill in his iron mail,
    <lb/>Brake from the centre to the height and cried:—
    <pb n="8.290"/>
    <lb/><q>Illustrious monarch! point me out the slave,
    <lb/>The doer of div’s work, ’gainst whom thou foughtest
    <lb/>When in Iran and fleddest while he triumphed.
    <lb/>Look to the army’s left and right, and find him
    <lb/>Among the chieftains. I will teach him warfare,
    <lb/>And show what hearts and might true warriors have.</q>
    <lb/>Thereat all mindful of the former fight
    <lb/>The Shah was vexed at heart because Kut said:—
    <lb/><q>Thou didst let fall thy knightly equipage,
    <lb/>And flee before a slave,</q> but answered not;
    <lb/>His heart was full, he sighed. At length he said:—
    <lb/><q>Approach yon rider on the piebald steed;
    <lb/>He will attack thee when he seeth thee;
    <lb/>Then fly not lest thou bite thy lips in shame.</q>
    <lb/>Kut sped back like the wind and spear in hand
    <lb/>Came furious as a maddened elephant
    <lb/>Upon the battlefield. Yalan-sina
    <lb/>Called to Bahram Chubina, saying: <q>Beware,
    <lb/>Brave cavalier! A div armed with a lance,
    <lb/>And with a lasso in his straps, hath come
    <lb/>Like elephant gone mad.</q>
    <lb/>He heard, unsheathed
    <lb/>Like wind his falchion and proclaimed his name,
    <lb/>Which when the Shah observed he rose and peered
    <lb/>Down from the mountain-top upon the pair,
    <lb/>Wet-eyed and wroth of heart. Now when the Riman
    <lb/>Charged with his lance the aspirant gripped his steed,
    <lb/>Escaped the thrust, raised to his face his shield,
    <lb/>And clave his foe asunder to the breast.
    <lb/>The sword’s clash reached Khusrau Parwiz who laughed
    <lb/>To see the stroke struck by Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>While valiant Niyatus frown-blinded raged
    <lb/>Because the Shah had laughed, and said: <q>Great sir!
    <lb/>One should not laugh in war whereof thou knowest
    <pb n="8.291"/>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1934"/>
    <lb/>Naught but the sleights, and when thou wouldst avenge
    <lb/>Thine ancestors I see thy heart asleep.
    <lb/>Men will not see in any peopled part
    <lb/>Of Rum or of Iran one like to Kut,
    <lb/>Hazara’s son, whose slaying made thee laugh.
    <lb/>Know this, that fortune hath deserted thee.</q>
    <lb/>He made reply: <q>I laugh not at his slaughter,
    <lb/>Or at his body which is cleft in twain.
    <lb/>'Know this that he who mocketh shall receive
    <lb/>Himself a buffet from the turning sky.
    <lb/>He said to me: <q>Thou fleddest from a slave
    <lb/>With whom thou hadst not prowess to contend.</q>
    <lb/>But fleeing from this slave who striketh blows
    <lb/>In such wise in the battle is no shame.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina for his part exclaimed:—
    <lb/><q>Ye chiefs of glorious birth—Yalan-sina,
    <lb/>Ram and Izid Gashasp! bind ye the slain
    <lb/>Upon his charger and thus send him back
    <lb/>To his own camp for their own Shah to see.</q>
    <lb/>They hasted to secure upon the saddle
    <lb/>The corpse of Kut, and then the charger sped
    <lb/>Back to the camp with that exalted chief.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was grieved at heart for Kut.
    <lb/>They loosed the knotted lasso from the slain,
    <lb/>Then by the Shah’s direction dried the body,
    <lb/>And having filled with musk and stitched the wounds,
    <lb/>Sewed up the corpse in linen and dispatched it,
    <lb/>All armed and girded, unto Cesar, saying:—
    <lb/><q>If this infernal slave can give such blows
    <lb/>In time of battle with his scimitar
    <lb/>I am not shamed for having fled from him.</q>
    <lb/>The Rumans were heart-broken ere they fought,
    <lb/>And sorely stricken; their patricians wept;
    <lb/>They all were tearful and dispirited.
    <lb/>Ten thousand of the mighty men advancing
    <pb n="8.292"/>
    <lb/>All prelates, warriors, and cavaliers,
    <lb/>Charged so that hills split at the cry of them.
    <lb/>The clash of arms, the shoutings of the chiefs,
    <lb/>The blows of scimitar and massive mace,
    <lb/>Rose. Thou hadst said: <q>It is a raging sea,
    <lb/>And heaven as it turneth crieth <q>Blood.</q></q>
    <lb/>The hosts were blocked and sundered by the slain;
    <lb/>An army of those Ruman chiefs had fallen.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was stricken to the heart,
    <lb/>And had the wounds of those still living dressed.
    <lb/>They piled the corpses mountain-high; men called it
    <lb/><q>The harvest of Bahram.</q> Khusrau Parwiz
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1935"/>
    <lb/>Lost faith in Rumans for he said: <q>If they
    <lb/>Bear them like this again know that their host
    <lb/>Will cease to be and all their swords of steel
    <lb/>Prove merely wax.</q>
    <lb/>Then said he to Sarkab:—
    <lb/><q>Tomorrow take no Rumans to engage:
    <lb/>But rest and I will lead the Iranian host
    <lb/>To battle.</q>
    <lb/>To the Iranians he said:—
    <lb/><q>No more delay; tomorrow ye must fight,</q>
    <lb/>And one and all replied: <q>We will not fail
    <lb/>To level to the plain mount, waste, and dale.</q>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><head>How Khusrau Parviz fought with Bahram Chubina the second Time, was defeated, and escaped from him by the Help of Surush</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>When day’s white banner rose aloft the main,
    <lb/>And when the stars grew hopeless of the dark,
    <lb/>The drummers went forth from both camp-enclosures
    <pb n="8.293"/>
    <lb/>With elephants and clarions. There rose
    <lb/>The sound of pipes and horns, the trumpeting
    <lb/>Of elephants, and clash of brazen cymbals.
    <lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The plains and uplands heave,
    <lb/>The sun’s face is like raven’s plumes,</q> and when
    <lb/>The Iranians ranged their ranks and grasped their spears,
    <lb/>And Indian swords, thou wouldst have said: <q>The earth
    <lb/>Is all cuirass, the spear-heads light the stars!</q>
    <lb/>Whenas Khusrau Parviz arrayed the centre
    <lb/>The troops took heart. Gurdwi, that brave aspirant,
    <lb/>Commanded on the right, and on the left
    <lb/>A famed Armenian<note n="1">Mausil.</note> with cuirass and sword
    <lb/>Like Ahriman’s. Shapur with Sipansar
    <lb/>And Andiyan drew tight their loins for battle,
    <lb/>While close beside the Shah was Gustaham -
    <lb/>To guard him from the foe.
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>The hero, seeing not the Rumans, paused
    <lb/>In silence, then commanded and they bound
    <lb/>The drums upon the elephants; the world
    <lb/>Was like the Nile. The elephant he rode
    <lb/>Was white and his antagonist despaired.
    <lb/>He charged the Shah’s right, shouting to Shapur:—
    <lb/><q>O knave! 'twas not thy promise in thy letter
    <lb/>To come against me on this field of blood!
    <lb/>This is not Persians’ usage, and thou givest
    <lb/>Thy body to be slaughtered all for naught.</q>
    <lb/>Shapur replied to him: <q>Thou div-like one!
    <lb/>Thou hast lost all thy wits in slavery.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1936"/>
    <lb/>Whose name and token did the letter bear
    <lb/>Of which thou speak’st in presence of the lords?</q>
    <lb/>Then great Khusrau Parviz said to Shapur:—
    <pb n="8.294"/>
    <lb/><q>That letter was to match with his designs;
    <lb/>I and the other nobles of the host
    <lb/>Will compensate thee for it. In due season
    <lb/>I will explain and purge thee of suspicion.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina heard Khusrau Parviz,
    <lb/>Perceived the ruse, was both enraged and shamed,
    <lb/>And in his wrath resolved on fight. The usurper
    <lb/>Charged all alone upon his elephant
    <lb/>The centre of the army of the Shah,
    <lb/>Who saw and said to Andiyan: <q>Fierce lion<note n="2"><cit><q xml:lang="fra"/>de sang.<bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
    <lb/>Shower arrows on yon elephant and make
    <lb/>Your bows like clouds in Spring.</q>
    <lb/>The Iranians,
    <lb/>All that were fortune-favoured, strung their bows.
    <lb/>The elephant’s trunk was riddled so with shafts
    <lb/>That thou hadst said: <q>It is a Nile!</q> Forthwith
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina called for horse and helm,
    <lb/>King-worthy, and the arrows showered anew
    <lb/>Upon that proud one’s steed. The warrior
    <lb/>Alighting, girt his mail-skirts round his waist,
    <lb/>And then with buckler raised above his head
    <lb/>Brought Doomsday with his trenchant scimitar
    <lb/>Upon the foe who dropped their bows of Chach,
    <lb/>And ran. They brought a horse. He mounted raging,
    <lb/>And shouting charged the centre of the foe—
    <lb/>The station of the Shah—and pierced it through:
    <lb/>The standard of the leader disappeared.
    <lb/>Thence went he toward the foe’s right and outflanked
    <lb/>The Persians and the baggage.<note n="3">Couplet omitted.</note> Now Gurdwi
    <lb/>Commanded there—a man of valiance
    <lb/>And of ambition. When he saw his brother
    <lb/>He strung and drew his bow. Those men of blood
    <lb/>Closed; thou hadst said: <q>They mingle.</q> Long they strove,
    <lb/>And neither would give way. Bahram Chubina
    <pb n="8.295"/>
    <lb/>Cried: <q>Miscreant! wherefore girdest thou thy loins
    <lb/>To shed thy brother’s blood?</q>
    <lb/>Gurdwi replied:—
    <lb/><q>Old wolf! hast thou not heard the weighty saw:—
    <lb/><q>A brother as a friend is good: forego
    <lb/>Both skin and vein if he become thy foe.</q>
     <milestone unit="calced" n="1937"/>
    <lb/>Thou art a man of blood, a miscreant,
    <lb/>An Ahriman, the Maker’s enemy
    <lb/>At heart. No one of honour and repute
    <lb/>Will come against his brother in the fight.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, hearing this, withdrew
    <lb/>In anger and high dudgeon, while Gurdwi,
    <lb/>His martial countenance a-gloom with iron,
    <lb/>Proceeded to the Shah. Khusrau Parviz
    <lb/>Commended him right lovingly and said:—
    <lb/><q>May turning heaven reward thee.</q>
    <lb/>Then the Shah
    <lb/>Made toward the centre, where his warriors reeled,
    <lb/>And sent one to Shapur. <q>Assist Mausil,</q>
    <lb/>He said, <q>put forth your power, fight back to back,
    <lb/>And ye may compass shining fortune yet.</q>
    <lb/>At that time said the king to Gustaham:—
    <lb/><q>If any Ruman shareth in this fight
    <lb/>Then when Bahram Chubina hath been worsted,
    <lb/>Or even wounded, they will raise their heads
    <lb/>Up to the sky and brag immeasurably.
    <lb/>I would not have the Rumans waxing proud,
    <lb/>And glorying over us about the war.
    <lb/>I have seen all their prowess; they are like
    <lb/>A flock in Winter. 'Twill be best for me
    <lb/>To fight with him short-handed; I require not
    <lb/>Aid from another for I trust in God,
    <lb/>The Succourer.</q>
    <lb/>Said Gustaham: <q>O king!
    <lb/>Conspire not thou against thine own sweet life;
    <lb/>But if thou art determined choose some comrades;
    <pb n="8.296"/>
    <lb/>Wreck not thy person on this battlefield.</q>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parviz rejoined: <q>What thou hast said
    <lb/>Is well, so make thy choice of some to help<note n="4">Reading with P.</note>
    <lb/>Out of the army.</q>
    <lb/>Gustaham selected
    <lb/>Twice seven Iranian horsemen brave and proud.
    <lb/>He wrote himself down first upon the list,
    <lb/>Then brave Shapur with Andiyan, Bandwi,
    <lb/>Gurdwi—the prop of kings—Azargashasp,
    <lb/>And then Shirzil, Rangwi who could outface
    <lb/>The lion and the elephant, Tukhara—
    <lb/>A help in fight and to Yalan-sina
    <lb/>A mortal foe—illustrious Khusrau,
    <lb/>And Farrukhzad, Ustad son<note n="5">Reading with P.</note> of Piruz,
    <lb/>Who caused his enemies to melt away,
    <lb/>Hurmuz and fortunate Khurshid—a pair
    <lb/>To whom their foemen were as grass. Their chief
    <lb/>Was gallant Gustaham expert in war.
    <lb/>On this wise he made choice of fourteen men,
    <lb/>And hurried with them from the host apart.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parviz harangued those chiefs and said:—
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1938"/>
    <lb/><q>My noble followers! look ye all to God,
    <lb/>Be blithe of heart and smiling. Naught will chance
    <lb/>But as He willeth while this ancient sky
    <lb/>Endureth. Better perish in the fight
    <lb/>Than have a slave to rule us. Ye must be
    <lb/>My body-guard and instant in the fray.</q>
    <lb/>All blessed him, hailed him king of earth and vowed
    <lb/>That none of them would quit him in the strife.
    <lb/>The monarch heard, was reassured, rejoiced,
    <lb/>And well contented with those warriors.
    <lb/>He left the host with glorious Bahram,
    <lb/>And went forth with those fourteen combatants,
    <lb/>While from the look-out rose a shout forthwith:
    <lb/>They told Bahram Chubina: <q>Troops have come.</q>
    </p>

    <pb n="8.297"/>
<p>
<lb/>That vigilant aspirant gat to horse
<lb/>With lasso in the straps and sword in hand.
<lb/>When from his steed he saw the sum of them
<lb/>He chose him some few warriors and spake
<lb/>Thus to Yalan-sina: <q>Yon miscreant
<lb/>Hath proved that he is hardy in the fight,
<lb/>For now I know that none but he would venture
<lb/>Upon this field of vengeance. He hath come
<lb/>Attended by a troop like this to battle,
<lb/>But it may be to face the crocodile!
<lb/>There are not more than twenty cavaliers,
<lb/>And not one of them do I recognise!</q><note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>Then to Izid Gashasp<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> and to Yalan-sina
<lb/>He said: <q>Men hide not valour. Four of us
<lb/>Will do, for fortune is a greater friend
<lb/>To me than to Khusrau Parviz.</q>
<lb/>He gave
<lb/>The host to one hight Janfurtiz, who loved
<lb/>The night’s gloom more than day, and then went forth
<lb/>Himself and sped on with the wary three.
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz perceived Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And told his comrades: <q>There hath come a troop.
<lb/>Be not perturbed for ’tis my time to stand.
<lb/>Leave it to me and with my mace to deal
<lb/>With vile Bahram Chubina: be it yours
<lb/>To combat with his chiefs. Ye are fourteen
<lb/>To three and may ye never see defeat.</q>
<lb/>Then with his Ruman soldiers Niyatus
<lb/>Must needs gird up the loins and from the field
<lb/>Of fight they made their way toward the heights
<lb/>To view both companies and all exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>Why bartereth the great Shah life for crown?
<lb/>Abundant horse are left and yet he goeth
<lb/>To fight in person recklessly!</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1939"/>
<lb/>All raised
<pb n="8.298"/>
<lb/>Their hands to heaven because they deemed him slain.
<lb/>Now when Bahram Chubina and his comrades—
<lb/>Yalan-sina and brave Izid Gashasp<note n="3">Couplet omitted.</note>—
<lb/>Charged, all the comrades of Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>Took flight. Bahram Chubina was the wolf,
<lb/>These nobles were the flock and full of dudgeon
<lb/>When they beheld that div escaped from bonds:
<lb/>Howbeit Bandwi, Gurdwi, and Gustaham
<lb/>Stayed with the Shah till, with a prayer to God,
<lb/>He also, left resourceless, turned his steed,
<lb/>Pressed by Izid Gashasp.<note n="4">Couplet omitted.</note> <q>My fate,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Is on me! Why in folly did I court
<lb/>This Doomsday, for the folk have looked upon
<lb/>My back in flight?</q>
<lb/>Said Gustaham: <q>The horsemen
<lb/>Approach us: wherefore shouldst thou fight alone?</q>
<lb/>The Shah looked back and saw Bahram Chubina
<lb/>The foremost of the four, and then to save
<lb/>Himself cut loose his charger’s sable mail.
<lb/>His three<note n="5">Couplet omitted.</note> companion-horsemen lagged behind;
<lb/>His vengeful foe pursued. A narrow gorge
<lb/>Confronted him. Behind him warriors three
<lb/>Came on like pards. The gorge was barred by rocks.
<lb/>The world-lord was afar from his own troops.
<lb/>That glorious youth dismounted fain to scale
<lb/>Afoot in haste the heights. His path was barred:
<lb/>The heart of that famed man was sore thereat.
<lb/>He might not tarry and he could not flee,
<lb/>While after him came fierce Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Who called to him: <q>O knave! the abyss is yawning
<lb/>Before thy height of greatness! Why hast thou
<lb/>-Thus shouldered thine own fate and brought it me?</q>
<lb/>Then straitened with the scimitar behind,
<lb/>The rocks in front, the Shah cried: <q>God almighty,
<lb/>Who art above the processes of time!
<pb n="8.299"/>
<lb/>Thou art my succour in my helpless strait:
<lb/>I cry not unto Mercury and Saturn.</q>
<lb/>Or ever from the mountain rose that cry
<lb/>Surush, the glorious, grew manifest
<lb/>Upon the pathway, garbed in green and riding
<lb/>A white steed. At that sight Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>Recovered confidence. Surush drew near,
<lb/>And having grasped the prince’s hand (such things
<lb/>Are not a marvel with all-holy God)
<lb/>And borne him from his foe, placed him in safety,
<lb/>And then let go his hold.
<lb/><q>What is thy name?</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz inquired and spake and wept
<lb/>By turns. He said: <q>Surush. Thou art in safety;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1940"/>
<lb/>Lament no more. Henceforth Great King art thou,
<lb/>And shouldst be naught but holy.</q>
<lb/>Having said,
<lb/>He vanished: none hath looked on such a marvel.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina saw and, all astound,
<lb/>Invoked the Maker oft. A trembling came
<lb/>Upon him when he saw his purpose foiled.
<lb/>He said: <q>May pluck ne’er fail me while I fight
<lb/>With men, but now that it hath come to fays
<lb/>I needs must weep for my beclouded fortunes.</q>
<lb/>For his part Niyatus upon the mountain
<lb/>Asked God’s protection, Maryam tore her cheeks
<lb/>In anguish for her world-lord spouse. The host
<lb/>Filled mountain, plain, and dale, the Rumans’ hearts
<lb/>Were grieved and seared. Said Niyatus to her:
<lb/><q>Stay here; I fear me that the Shah is lost.</q>
<lb/>With that upon the mountain’s further side,
<lb/>Far from the troops, Khusrau Parviz appeared.
<lb/>That famed host joyed and Maryam’s heart was eased.
<lb/>He came to her, informed her of that marvel,
<lb/>And thus he said: <q>O spouse of Caesar’s line!
<lb/>The just Judge hath done justice unto me;
<pb n="8.300"/>
<lb/>'Twas not through slackness or through cowardice,
<note>
    <cit><quote xml:lang="fra">que je me suis enfui.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit>
</note>
<lb/>For cowards show their slackness in the fight.
<lb/>I was companionless within the gorge,
<lb/>And in my trouble called upon the Maker,
<lb/>And He that ordereth the world’s affairs
<lb/>Revealed to me, His slave, His hidden purpose.
<lb/>Not glorious Faridun or Tur or Salm,
<lb/>Or yet Afrasiyab, e’er dreamed such things,
<lb/>For, nobles! what I looked upon today
<lb/>Betokeneth victory and sovereignty.
<lb/>Renew the struggle and remember me.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><head>How Khusrau Parwiz fought the third Time with Bahram Chubina and defeated him</head>
<p>
<lb/>Forthwith the host descended from the mountain;
<lb/>The world was blackened by the horsemen’s dust.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina for his part was troubled,
<lb/>Repenting all his conduct, but advanced,
<lb/>Not having any choice, his powers apace.
<lb/>There was no daylight left. He said: <q>All those
<lb/>Commanding troops need wisdom, mastery,
<lb/>And courage. Seeing how I ply the dart,
<lb/>And have the making of a paladin,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1941"/>
<lb/>The brave preferred me to Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>And I will bring the crown of Nushirwan
<lb/>To dust.</q>
<lb/>Advancing rashly toward the Shah
<lb/>He strung his bow and loosed a whole wood arrow,
<lb/>Which in a moment struck the Shah’s belt whence
<lb/>It dangled point-arrested by the silk.
<pb n="8.301"/>
<lb/>A slave that saw came and extracted it
<lb/>From the brocade. The Shah’s spear struck his foe
<lb/>Upon the belt which was of mail and broke not,
<lb/>But though the spear-head snapped the usurper quailed.
<lb/>The Shah, indignant that his spear was broken,
<lb/>Brought down his mace upon his foeman’s casque.
<lb/>The mace’s head was broken by the blow,
<lb/>And stuck upon the crest, while all that saw,
<lb/>Or heard the iron ring, acclaimed the Shah,
<lb/>Whose troops were heartened, for Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Had had a check, who, when the sun and moon
<lb/>Loured on him, turned reluctantly away,
<lb/>Aware how hard his task had grown—one past
<lb/>Both prowess and endeavour. The Shah’s host,
<lb/>When they beheld his lion-manlihood,
<lb/>All—Rumans and Iranians—unsheathed
<lb/>The sword of vengeance and charged mountain-like
<lb/>In mass. The magnates followed in his steps,
<lb/>And utterly o’erthrew those mighty powers.
<lb/>Bandwi came to the Shah and said: <q>O thou,
<lb/>Whose crown is higher than the sky and moon!
<lb/>This host like ants and locusts is dispersed
<lb/>Upon the plain, the sands, and stony ground.
<lb/>It is unworthy to shed needless blood,
<lb/>And for the Shah to strive against his slave.
<lb/>'Tis better that they should appeal to us
<lb/>For quarter than be slain or maimed in fight.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>I seek not vengeance
<lb/>On any that repent. I grant them grace;
<lb/>They are the earrings of my crown.</q>
<lb/>Night’s flag
<lb/>Rose o’er the darksome hills, both hosts withdrew,
<lb/>The sentries challenged, bells rang, and the troops
<lb/>Had little sleep. Bandwi, the ambitious, went
<pb n="8.302"/>
<lb/>Between the hosts, chose from the troops a chief—
<lb/>A herald fluent, with a goodly voice—
<lb/>Bade him to mount upon his Arab steed,
<lb/>And make him ready to proclaim. They rode
<lb/>Between the hosts till close upon the foe,
<lb/>And then the herald shouted: <q>O ye slaves,
<lb/>In fault yourselves and followers of fortune!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1942"/>
<lb/>By God! the Shah will pardon all, e’en those
<lb/>That have done worst and in the war achieved
<lb/>Most fame, be their faults patent or concealed.</q>
<lb/>The sound went through the darkness of the night,
<lb/>And all gave ear. Bahram Chubina’s chiefs
<lb/>Girt up their loins to quit him. When the sun
<lb/>Rose o’er the hills, and day spread taffeta
<lb/>Upon the ground, the tents upon the plain
<lb/>Were all abandoned, but Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Was not aware of what had passed that night.
<lb/>None but his friends were to be seen in camp.
<lb/>On hearing of the troops he visited
<lb/>The tents and told his comrades: <q>To retreat
<lb/>Is better now than waking on a Doomsday.</q>
<lb/>He bade the master of his camels furnish
<lb/>Two thousand lusty and foam-scattering,
<lb/>And all his treasures that were portable,
<lb/>The hangings and the carpets and the plate
<lb/>Of gold and silver, with the ivory thrones,
<lb/>The golden torques, the armlets and the crowns,
<lb/>They loaded up and then themselves took seat
<lb/>Upon their steeds and girt them for retreat.

<lb/>Whenas the bright sun had arrayed its throne
<lb/>Exploring parties went out from the Shah;
<lb/>They found the chieftain’s tent unoccupied,
<lb/>While of the other tents not many stood.
<lb/>The scouts came in and told Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>Who grieved the more about that battlefield.<note>Because Bahram Chubina had escaped.</note>
<lb/>He chose three thousand cavaliers in mail
<lb/>On barded steeds, then bade Nastuh to mount,
<lb/>And gird his warlike loins for the pursuit.
<lb/>He went in dudgeon; he was not the man
<lb/>To fight Bahram Chubina who the while,
<lb/>Uncertain of his kingdom and his rights,
<lb/>Kept with himself his silver and his gold,
<lb/>And marched all fearful by a trackless route.
<lb/>Yalan-sina and brave Izid Gashasp
<lb/>Rode by the soldiers’ side conducting them
<lb/>Along those wayless ways and as they went
<milestone unit="calced" n="1943"/>
<lb/>Told stories of the Shahs. They saw afar
<lb/>A ruined hamlet where no chief could dwell,
<lb/>And as Bahram Chubina rode ahead,
<lb/>Remorseful and in dudgeon, he and all
<lb/>His men athirst, he found a carline’s cot.
<lb/>In courteous terms they asked for bread and water.
<lb/>She brought a worn-out sieve, laid down a sheep-skin,
<lb/>All tattered, and set out upon the sieve
<lb/>Dry bread. Yalan-sina then handed him

<lb/>Of muttering prayer.<note>Couplet omitted.</note> They ate, then asked for wine,
<lb/>And prayed.
<lb/><q>If ye would have wine,</q> said the crone,
<lb/><q>There is some, and I have too an old gourd,
<lb/>The end of which I cut off even now,
<lb/>Have made a cup, and set it by the wine.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said: <q>If wine is there,
<lb/>What better cup could be?</q>
<lb/>She went and fetched them,
<lb/>And he was well content to use that cup.
<lb/>He gave it brimming to her that she might
<lb/>Be festive too, and said: <q>My gracious mother!
<lb/>What tidings hast thou of the world’s affairs?</q>
<lb/><q>My brain is worn out, I have heard so much,</q>
<lb/>She answered. <q>Many came from town to-day,
<lb/>And talked but of Bahram Chubina’s battle,
<lb/>How all his troops deserted to the Shah,
<lb/>And how the chief fled hostless.</q>
<lb/><q>Pious dame!</q>
<lb/>He answered, <q>say if he hath acted wisely
<lb/>Or followed his desires.</q>
<lb/><q>Famed man!</q> she said,
<lb/><q>How is it that the Div hath dimmed thine eyes?
<lb/>Dost thou not know that since Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Son of Gashasp, urged on his steed against
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, son of Hurmuzd, the sages
<lb/>Laugh at him? None accounteth him a chief.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said: <q>Since his desires
<lb/>Have made him quaff wine from a gourd do thou
<lb/>Keep barley-bread for him on this old sieve
<lb/>Until next barley-harvest.</q><note>i.e., <quote>Since I have been led into wrong-doing by my desires let me continue to fare badly</quote>—words put into Bahram Chubina’s mouth by the author or redactor of the Romance. This is another instance of the legitimist feeling pervading this portion of the poem. See Vol. vi. p. 251.</note>
<pb n="8.305"/>
<lb/>Having eaten
<lb/>He passed withal the night there in his tunic,
<lb/>His shoulders on his breastplate, but sleep came not:
<lb/>He found no rest—to vain desires a prey.
<lb/>Whenas the sun in heaven made secrets clear
<lb/>The warlike chieftain had the tabor sounded,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1944"/>
<lb/>What troops he had he gathered, and those nobles
<lb/>Set forth and came upon a goodly reed-bed,
<lb/>And many folk were harvesting the reeds,
<lb/>Who when they saw afar Bahram Chubina
<lb/>With his large body of determined men,
<lb/>Said: <q>Blest be thou! Why take the reed-bed thus?
<lb/>In front are many troops with hands blood-bathed
<lb/>For fight.</q>
<lb/><q>They must be horse,</q> he made reply,
<lb/><q>Sent by the king. I heard, when we resolved
<lb/>To quit our camp, that he had chosen Nastuh,
<lb/>A man ambitious but inapt, to lead
<lb/>Three thousand cavaliers—stiff opposites
<lb/>In battle—in pursuit of us. When I
<lb/>Behold him I will end his days. Now tighten
<lb/>Your girths and ring him in.</q>
<lb/>The cavaliers
<lb/>Drew tight their girths and grasped their Indian swords.
<lb/>They fired the reed-bed and o’erthrew their foes:
<lb/>That bed of reeds was utterly consumed,
<lb/>This man was slain, that burnt. Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>The warrior, perceived Nastuh and gave
<lb/>His fleet steed rein, and with the lasso’s noose
<lb/>Unhorsed Nastuh whose feckless hands they bound.
<lb/>He begged for quarter, saying: <q>Famous king!
<lb/>Why wish to shed my blood? Compassionate
<lb/>My luckless fortune. Slay me not that I
<lb/>May run before thee and approve myself
<lb/>Thy wretched mendicant.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <pb n="8.306"/>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>Replied: <q>I would not carry from the field
    <lb/>Of fight such men as thee. I will not sever
    <lb/>Thy head because I shame at having fought
    <lb/>A cavalier like thee. When thou art set
    <lb/>At liberty be off with you and tell
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz what thou hast seen of me.</q>
    <lb/>Nastuh, on hearing, kissed the ground and gave
    <lb/>Abundant thanks. This done, Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>Departed with his warriors good at need
    <lb/>To Rai, reposed, then sought the Khan with speed.

<milestone unit="calced" n="1945"/>
<p>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz on his side visited
<lb/>Bahram Chubina’s lines and pillaged them,
<lb/>Bestowing on his soldiers purse and crown.
<lb/>He mounted a fleet steed and girt himself
<lb/>For prayer. Before him was a bramble-brake.
<lb/>He entered that befitting place afoot,
<lb/>And wallowed in the dust before his God.
<lb/><q>O righteous Judge!</q> he said, <q>Thou hast delivered
<lb/>The country from the burden of the foe,
<lb/>And hast surpassed our whole imaginings.
<lb/>I am thy worshipper and worthless slave:
<lb/>I walk according to the Lord’s command.</q>
<lb/>Thence he returned to camp; his counsellors
<lb/>Assembled, and he called a scribe to write
<lb/>A letter out on silk from Shah to Caesar,
<lb/>Detailing what had passed in that campaign.
<pb n="8.307"/>
<lb/>He first praised God—the Source of manliness,
<lb/>Of prowess, and success, then said: <q>In secret
<lb/>Much hath God favoured me. I and my host
<lb/>Came to Azargashasp. I hurried onward,
<lb/>Returning for the fight. Bahram Chubina
<lb/>So pressed me that I had not room to strive;
<lb/>But when all-holy God ceased to assist
<lb/>My foe the flaming blast of war died out,
<lb/>And with resources failing and with troops
<lb/>Deserting he withdrew at break of day.
<lb/>I have destroyed his whole host, fired his camp,
<lb/>And intercepted too by God’s behest
<lb/>His line of march.</q>
<lb/>They set upon the letter
<lb/>The Shah’s seal, and the messengers departing
<lb/>Bare it to famous Caesar’s court where he,
<lb/>Whose fortune was awake, on reading it,
<lb/>Descended from his throne and cried to God:—
<lb/><q>O Guide! Thou changest never. Thou hast made
<lb/>Thy slave triumphant and restored the outcast.</q>
<lb/>He lavished alms and provand by the ass-load,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1946"/>
<lb/>And wrote withal an answer like a tree
<lb/>In Paradise, beginning: <q>In the name
<lb/>Of God, the Lord of victory, of Grace,
<lb/>And justice, Lord of moon and sun and might.
<lb/>Know thou that greatness and good fortune come
<lb/>From Him, what while thou livest give Him praise,
<lb/>And in this world in public and in private
<lb/>Ensue but justice and beneficence.</q>
<lb/>He sent a crown—an heirloom of the Caesars,
<lb/>Reserved for fit occasions—with a pair
<lb/>Of earrings and a royal torque, of robes
<lb/>Eleven hundred broidered all in gold,
<lb/>A hundred camel-loads of gold dinars,
<lb/>As well as many pearls and precious stones,
<lb/>A jewelled cross and throne all royal gems,
<pb n="8.308"/>
<lb/>A green robe shot with gold whereof the fringe
<lb/>Was finished off with jewels. With the gifts
<lb/>And offerings went four philosophers
<lb/>Of those of Rum. Khusrau Parwiz dispatched
<lb/>A thousand cavaliers of noble birth
<lb/>To meet and welcome them. Those magnates reached
<lb/>With their new gifts Khusrau Parwiz in safety,
<lb/>Who, having viewed them and perused the letter,
<lb/>Was lost in wonder at that wealth and said
<lb/>To his own minister: <q>These robes of Rum,
<lb/>Adorned with jewelry are not the wear
<lb/>Of wealthy thanes but Christian priests! If we
<lb/>Have Crosses on our dress we shall conform
<lb/>To Christian fashion. If I wear them not
<lb/>'Twill anger Caesar who will of a truth
<lb/>Misconstrue me, while if I put them on
<lb/>The magnates all will say: 'This king of men
<lb/>Perchance hath turned a Christian for wealth’s sake,
<lb/>Because he is all Cross.</q>
<lb/>His counsellor
<lb/>Replied: <q>O Shah! clothes constitute not Faith.
<lb/>Though Caesar be thy kin thy Faith is still
<lb/>That of Zarduhsht, the Prophet.</q>
<lb/>Then he donned
<lb/>Those royal robes, hung up the jewelled crown,
<lb/>Bade raise the curtain, and bring in the envoys.
<lb/>Both Rumans and Iranians crowded in
<lb/>Without distinction. When the sages saw
<lb/>The Shah’s attire they knew that he desired
<lb/>To pleasure Caesar, others said that he
<lb/>Had of a truth turned Christian privily.

<p>
<pb n="8.309"/>
<lb/>Next day Khusrau Parwiz prepared his throne,
<lb/>And donned his crown of state. The festal board
<lb/>Was spread within the rosary. <q>Invite,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>the Rumans.</q>
<lb/>Niyatus arrived
<lb/>With the other Rumans and they took their seats
<lb/>Before the board with the philosophers.
<lb/>Now when Khusrau Parwiz came from his throne
<lb/>Of audience in the jewelled robes from Rum,
<lb/>Advanced with smiles and sat down at the board,
<lb/>Bandwi came quickly, sacred twigs in hand.
<lb/>The world-lord took them with intent to join
<lb/>The other nobles in their muttered prayers,<note>See Vol. i. p. 80.</note>
<lb/>While Niyatus, on seeing that, threw down
<lb/>His bread and all disordered left the board,
<lb/>Exclaiming: <q>Muttered prayer and Cross at once
<lb/>Insulteth Christ through Caesar!</q>
<lb/>Seeing this
<lb/>Bandwi, still at the board, back-handed smote
<lb/>That servant of the Cross upon the face.
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz was grieved, beholding this;
<lb/>His cheeks grew like the flower of fenugreek.
<lb/>He said to Gustaham: <q>This valiant fool
<lb/>Should wrangle not when drinking. What hath he
<lb/>To do with Ruman Niyatus? He recked not
<lb/>His person in this quarrel.</q>
<lb/>Niyatus,
<lb/>Departing, mounted and returned half drunk
<lb/>To camp. He donned his Ruman mail and thought
<pb n="8.310"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1948"/>
<lb/>To mar that feast. The Ruman cavaliers,
<lb/>All eager for the fray, set face to where
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz held court, and Niyatus
<lb/>Sent on a cavalier of Ruman race
<lb/>Withal to go like wind to him and say:—
<lb/><q>Bandwi, the worthless, with a back-hand blow
<lb/>Smote on the cheek God’s servant. Now if thou
<lb/>Wilt send him to me—well. If not, expect
<lb/>A tumult of the folk. Thou wilt writhe more
<lb/>At me than at the slave<note>Bahram Chubina.</note> ambitioning
<lb/>The throne of king of kings.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Was wroth on hearing this. <q>None should ignore
<lb/>The Faith of God,</q> he said. <q>From Gaiumart
<lb/>And from Jamshid to Kai Kubad none spake
<lb/>Of Christ, and God forbid that I shall quit
<lb/>My fathers’ Faith, those world-lords choice and holy,
<lb/>Adopt the Faith of Christ, and murmur not
<lb/>A prayer at meals but be a Christian!
<lb/>If thou wilt take account thou art alone:
<lb/>I saw of late what Ruman prowess is!</q>
<lb/>Then Maryam spake thus to Khusrau Parwiz:—
<lb/><q>I will abate the brawling of these folk.
<lb/>Commit illustrious Bandwi to me,
<lb/>So that the Rumans may contemplate him
<lb/>From head to foot. I will restore him whole.
<lb/>None ever made a point of senseless strife.</q>
<lb/>The king dispatched Bandwi to Niyatus,
<lb/>Escorted by ten horsemen, with Maryam,
<lb/>That prudent lady on whose lips good counsel
<lb/>Ne’er failed. He said: <q>Approach thy father’s brother,
<lb/>And say: <q>Thou quarrelsome, ill-meaning man!
<lb/>Hast thou not seen how Caesar hath assisted
<lb/>The Shah to majesty, hath fought his battles,
<pb n="8.311"/>
<lb/>Hath made affinity and league with him,
<lb/>And furnished men and means and hoarded treasures?
<lb/>Wilt thou destroy affinity and league,
<lb/>And take away from me the Grace of Caesar,
<lb/>Who told thee that the Shah would not abandon
<lb/>His Faith on his return? Why speak raw words?
<lb/>Now take Bandwi’s head to thy breast and utter
<lb/>No word ungracious. Give not to the winds
<lb/>The toil and work of Caesar, and God grant
<lb/>That thou mayst not recall my words too late.</q></q>
<lb/>She went and spake to that effect. Her cheeks
<lb/>Were like a rose in bloom, and Niyatus,
<lb/>Who thought her words of profit, took her counsel.
<lb/>He pacified his heart about Bandwi,
<lb/>And shamed on his account, at sight of him
<lb/>Arose and bade his treasurer bring forth
<lb/>A noble led horse and received Bandwi
<lb/>With smiles and welcome, and they visited
<lb/>The king together. When Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Saw Niyatus he said: <q>The heart of one
<lb/>Of ill condition seeketh not for good.
<lb/>Bandwi hath ne’er ensued but strife and tumult:
<lb/>Make not the world both dark and strait to me;
<lb/>Give not the toil of Caesar to the wind
<lb/>In passion; let me have a moment’s joy.<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>If he hath spoken ill of thy religion
<lb/>Expect not wisdom from a foolish man.</q>
<lb/><q>Expect not wisdom from a Ruman drunk,
<lb/>O Shah!</q> said Niyatus. <q>Keep thy sires’ Faith,
<lb/>For wise men change not such.</q>
<lb/>When in this strain
<lb/>Much talk had passed he sought his camp again.

<lb/>The Shah then bade Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
<lb/><q>Hold a review and call a court. Let all

<lb/>Bestow on them two thirds of all my treasures;
<lb/>They must feel well content with what we give.</q>
<lb/>For all deserving of a robe of honour
<lb/>By prowess shown in fight he bade make ready
<lb/>Such, and to requisition splendid steeds
<lb/>From his own court. He gave to Niyatus
<lb/>Such jewels, steeds, and handmaids girt with gold
<lb/>That they exceeded measure and surpassed
<lb/>Withal what potentates were used to give.
<lb/>All cities taken by Kubad from Rum,
<lb/>Or captured by Hurmuzd and Nushirwan
<lb/>Of glorious birth, he gave to Niyatus,
<lb/>Had patents drawn for them and filled the cup
<lb/>Of colocynth with honey. Then the Rumans
<lb/>Set forth for Rum, that prosperous coast and land.
<lb/>The great Khusrau Parwiz escorted them
<lb/>Two stages, farewelled Niyatus, and then
<lb/>Turned back. Next week he took ten cavaliers,
<lb/>Both shrewd and true to him, and quitting camp
<lb/>Fared to Azargashasp. On seeing the dome
<lb/>He lighted down and went afoot, his eyes
<lb/>All wet, his cheeks sun-yellow. When he passed
<lb/>The portal and approached the Fire his visage
<lb/>Was hidden by his tears. There he recited
<lb/>The Zandavasta for a se’nnight’s space,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<pb n="8.313"/>
<lb/>And humbly danced attendance on the Fire,
<lb/>Departing on the eighth day for the feast
<lb/>Of Sada was at hand. As he had promised
<lb/>Before his lords he gave his share of spoil,
<lb/>Of gold and silver, jewel-work, and gems
<lb/>Fit for a monarch, to the Fire. He gave
<lb/>Drachms to the poor abundantly and left
<lb/>No one dissatisfied throughout the land.
<lb/>He went thence to the country of Andiv
<lb/>To have his portion in the day of joy:
<lb/>That province was the salt waste’s boundary,
<lb/>And none could put a value on the soil.
<lb/>Within the palace built by Nushirwan,
<lb/>Who dwelt there much, he had a splendid suite
<lb/>Of rooms prepared, the golden throne arrayed,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1950"/>
<lb/>And then the conquering, God-fearing world-lord
<lb/>Came and sat down upon his grandsire’s seat,
<lb/>And bade a scribe and his own minister—
<lb/>A helpful archimage—attend. They wrote
<lb/>Out patents for the Iranians as the Great
<lb/>And Mighty used to do. Bandwi, the chief,
<lb/>The well-advised, the veteran, managed all.
<lb/>The Shah gave Khurasan to Gustaham,
<lb/>And bade him reinstate both law and justice,
<lb/>Assisted by Burzmihr, the experienced scribe
<lb/>Of beauteous face, and since heaven favoured him
<lb/>Bestowed by grant Istakhr and Dardabgird.
<lb/>He set his golden signet on the patent,
<lb/>Then handed it to Ram Barzin forthwith,
<lb/>And bade him bear it to Shapur to whom
<lb/>He gave withal both slaves and robe of honour.
<lb/>He bade convey a patent under seal
<lb/>To Andiyan, as was the royal use,
<lb/>And gave him all the country of Kirman
<lb/>Because Khusrau Parwiz esteemed him great.
<lb/>He gave another province to Gurdwi,
<pb n="8.314"/>
<lb/>And sealed the letter with the golden seal.
<lb/>He gave Balwi the town of Chach and sent
<lb/>The patent with an ivory throne. He counted
<lb/>The treasury-keys and to Tukhara’s son
<lb/>Committed them. The monarch of the world,
<lb/>This matter ended, turned to folk at large,
<lb/>And bade the chieftains all obey Kharrad,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, whose rule should be world-wide,
<lb/>And name be countersigned on every patent.
<lb/>The soldiers all that in the time of action
<lb/>Held by the famous king were given from him
<lb/>A robe of honour and dismissed with joy.
<lb/>A herald fluent and a chief withal
<lb/>Of sweet voice and shrewd heart went round proclaiming:—
<lb/><q>O ye, the subjects of the king of earth!
<lb/>Praise justice only, seek not vengeance, shed

<lb/>My turn it was and yet the youth hath gone,
<lb/>While I for sorrow am as soulless clay.
<lb/>I will make haste, perchance o’ertake, and say

<milestone unit="calced" n="1952"/>
<p>
<pb n="8.317"/>
<lb/>Tell now old tales, tell of Bahram Chubina.
<lb/>When he drew near the country of the Turks,
<lb/>Toward the Lions and the Khan, there went
<lb/>Ten thousand shrewd and wary cavaliers,
<lb/>Led by the son and brother of the Khan,
<lb/>Each with a priest as counsellor, to meet him.
<lb/>On reaching the Khan’s throne Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Gave praises to him and did reverence.
<lb/>The Khan, upon beholding him, rose, kissed,
<lb/>And stroked caressingly his face, inquiring
<lb/>At large about the travail of the way,
<lb/>And of his warfare with the Shah and host,
<lb/>Then gave a welcome to Izid Gashasp
<lb/>Withal and to Yalan-sina—those chiefs
<lb/>No longer hostile. When Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Was seated on the silvern throne he took
<lb/>In his the Khan’s hand, saying: <q>Glorious prince,
<lb/>The captain and ruler of the Turks
<lb/>Of Chin! thou know’st that no one is secure
<lb/>Within the world by reason of malign
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz who vexeth those that fain
<lb/>Would rest from toil and doubleth it for those
<lb/>That live at ease. If now thou wilt accept me,
<lb/>And be mine aid in good and evil, I
<lb/>Will be thy comrade in this priceless land,
<lb/>And friend in good and ill, while shouldst thou suffer
<lb/>Through me I will depart and seek a cistern
<lb/>Elsewhere, and if thou wilt have none of me
<lb/>Then I will journey unto Hindustan.</q>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Noble chieftain! never mayst
<lb/>Thou need that day. Like mine own kin will I
<lb/>Hold thee. My kin? Nay, better than my child.
<lb/>My whole land will co-operate with me
<lb/>Herein, both lord and liege. Pre-eminence
<lb/>I give thee o’er my chiefs and furthermore
<lb/>I make thee independent of my lords.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina further asked an oath
<lb/>To bind his soul, for so far all was tongue.
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>By the most high God, the Guide
<lb/>Of me and thee, I am thy mate indeed,
<lb/>What while I live, and friend for good and ill.</q>
<lb/>Thereafter they prepared two palaces,
<lb/>And furnished them with vessels of all kinds.
<lb/>Slaves, food, and raiment, needful carpeting,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1953"/>
<lb/>With serviceable plate of gold and silver,
<lb/>Dinars and royal jewelry, the Khan
<lb/>Sent to Bahram Chubina whose dark soul
<lb/>Grew bright, and save with whom the Khan went not
<lb/>To polo, the assembly, and the chase,
<lb/>Remaining in this mind and lauding him.
<lb/>The Khan possessed a chief who was his friend,
<lb/>His help in war and of a stronger nature,<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">un homme de plus haute naissance que le prince.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Named Makatura, by whose means the Khan
<lb/>Had won success and fame. He used to visit
<lb/>The Khan at dawn with fingers on his lips,
<lb/>For thus did subjects offer reverence,
<lb/>To those illustrious potentates of Chin,
<pb n="8.318"/>
<lb/>And each time from the veteran monarch’s treasure
<lb/>Would carry fifty score dinars away.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina marked this for a while,
<lb/>Astonied at the Khan, then laughed and said
<lb/>One day: <q>Exalted one! thou art esteemed
<lb/>Among the potentates, yet every morn
<lb/>At audience-time this Turk thus beareth off
<lb/>These fifty score dinars! If he receiveth
<lb/>A mine ’tis not for rendered services,</q><note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Que ce soit un cadeau, que ce soit sa paye, faut-il donc que sa part soit tout l’or d’une mine ?</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>The Khan replied: <q>This is a way of ours—
<lb/>The glory of our Faith—that all our bravest,
<lb/>And stanchest on the day of stress, should meet
<lb/>With no refusal when they ask for more,
<lb/>And plead with importunity. His power
<lb/>Is more than mine. I charm him with dinars.
<lb/>If I refused the troops would mutiny,
<lb/>And dim my shining day.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <pb n="8.319"/>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>The world-aspirant, said: <q>O king of men!
    <lb/>Thou hast made him a master o’er thyself.
    <lb/>When world-lords are both valiant and alert
    <lb/>They must not let a subject have the reins.
    <lb/>If I should rid thee of him wouldst thou be
    <lb/>Well pleased or dost thou care for his support?</q>
    <lb/><q>'Tis thine to order this,</q> replied the Khan,
    <lb/><q>And thine to plan and compass this desire.
    <lb/>If thou canst free me from him thou wilt bring
    <lb/>The question to an end.</q>
    <lb/><q>To-morrow morn,</q>
    <lb/>He made reply, <q>when Makatura cometh
    <lb/>For his dinars, smile not, regard him not,
    <lb/>And answer not or, if at all, in wrath.</q>
    <lb/>That night passed and at dawn came Makatura
    <lb/>Before the Khan. That world-lord neither saw him,
    <lb/>Nor heard what that bold Turk had got to say,
    <lb/>Who, angered, raged and glared at him, and cried:
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1954"/>
    <lb/><q>Why is it that to-day I have grown vile,
    <lb/>My lord? Assuredly this Persian prince,
    <lb/>Who reached our land with thirty friends, is striving
    <lb/>To turn thee from the right and would consign
    <lb/>Thine army to the wind.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>Replied: <q>O warrior! why so fierce in talk?
    <lb/>I, if the Khan will follow mine advice,
    <lb/>And prudently regard our covenant,
    <lb/>Will let not thee come hither every morn
    <lb/>To waste his treasures with impunity.
    <lb/>Thou mayest be three hundred cavaliers,
    <lb/>And hunt the Lions on the battlefield;
    <lb/>It followeth not that thou each morn shouldst come,
    <lb/>And claim dinars by ass-loads from the king.</q>
    <lb/>When Makatutra heard his head became
    <lb/>All vengeful at Bahram Chubina’s scheme.
    <lb/>In wrath and passion he put forth his hand,
    <lb/>And plucked a poplar arrow from his quiver.
    <lb/><q>This is my token and interpreter
    <lb/>In battle,</q> said he to Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/><q>So look out for my point when thou shalt come
    <lb/>To court to-morrow morn.</q>
    <lb/>On hearing this
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, growing mettlesome,
    <lb/>Gave him a poplar arrow tipped with steel,
    <lb/>And said: <q>Receive this keepsake and observe
    <lb/>Its usefulness.</q>
    <lb/>Then Makatura went
    <lb/>Forth from the Khan and hurried to his tent.
    </p>
    
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><head>How Makatura was slain by Bahram Chubina</head>
<p>
<pb n="8.320"/>
<lb/>When night withdrew its sombre skirt, and dawn
<lb/>Brake o’er the gloomy mountains, Makatura
<lb/>Put on his battle-armour and went forth,
<lb/>Turanian sword in hand. Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>On hearing, called for steed and royal breastplate.
<lb/>The spot they chose was one whose plain and waste
<lb/>No leopards e’er resorted to for fight.
<lb/>The Khan, on hearing, mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And went accompanied by the loyal Turks
<lb/>To see which raging Lion of the twain
<lb/>Would have the better fortune. Makatura,
<lb/>On coming to the scene of strife, dispatched
<lb/>Dust cloudward from the plain and shouted thus
<lb/>To haughty Bahram Chubina: <q>What hast thou
<lb/>To say of manhood now? Wilt thou begin,
<lb/>Or shall the loyal, lion-hearted Turk?</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said: <q>Begin thyself,
<lb/>For thou didst start this quarrel by thy words.</q>
<lb/>Then Makatura called on God and strung
<milestone unit="calced" n="1955"/>
<lb/>His bow, grasped joyfully the string and arrow,
<lb/>Drew to the point and then released his thumb.
<lb/>He struck the cavalier upon the belt,
<lb/>But that bright iron point pierced not the mail.
<lb/>Bahram Chubina held aloof awhile
<lb/>That Makatura might grow tired of fight,
<lb/>Who, thinking that his enemy was shent,
<lb/>Turned shouting from the field.
<lb/><q>O warrior!</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina cried, <q>thou hast not slain me;
<lb/>Depart not to thy tent. Thy say is said;
<lb/>Stop and hear my reply and, if thou livest
<pb n="8.321"/>
<lb/>When thou hast heard it, go.</q>
<lb/>With that he chose
<lb/>A breastplate-piercing shaft of poplar-wood,
<lb/>One to which stone and iron were as wax,
<lb/>And hit the valiant horseman on the girdle.
<lb/>That chief grew satiate of dinars and fight,
<lb/>And wept and slept upon his bast-bound saddle,
<lb/>For he, on mounting for the fray, had tied
<lb/>His two feet to the saddle and thus kept
<lb/>His seat though wounded, while his wounder rode
<lb/>Up to the Khan and said: <q>Imperious!
<lb/>Yon noble needeth one to dig his grave.</q>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Look more closely. He is swooning,
<lb/>But living on the saddle.</q>
<lb/>Thus replied
<lb/>Bahram Chubina: <q>Puissant sovereign!
<lb/>His body cometh even now to dust.
<lb/>May all thy foemen swoon as he is swooning
<lb/>On his Turanian steed.</q>
<lb/>The valiant Khan
<lb/>Dispatched a cavalier to that famed Lion,
<lb/>Whom they saw bound, slain vilely, and released
<lb/>From fate’s vicissitudes. The Khan thereat
<lb/>Laughed to himself in secret, wondering
<lb/>At that chief horseman of the world’s exploit;
<lb/>Then full of thought returned to his own palace
<lb/>With crown that soared to Saturn in his joy.
<lb/>He called for arms and drachms, for steeds and slaves,
<lb/>Gemmed trinketry, imperial crown, dinars,
<lb/>King-worthy jewels, and all kinds of gear
<lb/>Of war. These from the Khan a messenger
<lb/>Bare to Bahram Chubina’s treasurer.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><head>How the Lion-ape slew a Daughter of the Khan, how it was slain by Bahram Chubina, and how the Khan gave him a Daughter and the Kingdom of Chin</head>
<p>

<lb/>Time passed and peace was tutor night and day.
<lb/>There were at that time in the hills of Chin
<milestone unit="calced" n="1956"/>
<lb/>Wild animals past count. One was a beast
<lb/>Out-bulking horses and upon its head
<lb/>Were two black locks like cables. It was tawny
<lb/>Of body while its ears and throat were black.
<lb/>None saw it save at noon-tide and it had
<lb/>Two claws resembling those of mighty lions.
<lb/>Its roar rose o’er the clouds, it swallowed stones,
<lb/>And turned the day of mighty men to gloom.
<lb/>Folk called it <q>Lion-ape:</q> the land was all
<lb/>Confounded at the ill it wrought. The Khan
<lb/>Possessed a moon-like daughter, had the moon
<lb/>Two raven locks, two rubious lips, a nose
<lb/>As ’twere a silvern reed, two smiling cheeks
<lb/>Of coral, and dark eyes. Her parents used
<lb/>To weep for terror lest the sun should strike her.
<lb/>One day she went forth to the plain and roamed
<lb/>The meadows while the Khan, the world-lord, followed
<lb/>The chase elsewhere. The queen was in the palace
<lb/>Engaged in converse with a counsellor.
<lb/>Thus went her daughter to that meadow-land
<lb/>With other damsels, wine, and revellers.
<lb/>The lion-ape descried her from the heights,
<lb/>Descended to the plain and gulped her down.
<lb/>That fair-cheeked damsel ended in a breath.

<lb/>The Khan heard and his face turned black, his queen
<pb n="8.323"/>
<lb/>Tore out her hair: they mourned the maid for years,
<lb/>As if they had been burning in fierce flames,
<lb/>And sought to slay the monster and relieve
<lb/>Chin from that stress. Now when Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Fought with and sent the dust from Makatura
<lb/>The queen went forth to watch him and discoursed
<lb/>To all about his prowess. Meeting him
<lb/>One day with five score nobles of Iran,
<lb/>And many men on foot preceding him,
<lb/>While he rode with a counsellor, she asked:
<lb/><q>Who is this with such height and grace divine?</q>
<lb/>A servant answered: <q>Thou hast much to learn,
<lb/>Not knowing brave Bahram Chubina’s name!
<lb/>He once was Shah within Iran; his crown
<lb/>Out-topped the moon. Chiefs title him 'Bahram
<lb/>The brave,' for he hath borne the fame of valour
<lb/>From other kings, and now that he hath quitted
<lb/>Iran for Chin earth quaketh ’neath his charger.
<lb/>Our sovereign would have him for a chief,
<lb/>So setteth on his head a royal crown.</q>
<lb/>She thus made answer: <q>Since his grace is such
<lb/>Well may we nestle underneath his wings,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1957"/>
<lb/>And well may I request a boon of him;
<lb/>He will not act with slackness like the Khan,
<lb/>But avenge me on the monster when he heareth
<lb/>The reason for my grief and malisons.</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>If the queen of upright folk
<lb/>Will speak to him she will not find a trace
<lb/>Left of the lion-ape except a corpse
<lb/>Dragged by the feet by wolves.</q>
<lb/>She heard and joyed:
<lb/>Pain for her daughter left her. She made haste
<lb/>To see the Khan and tell him all. He said:
<lb/><q>Where there is a horseman such as I, and where
<lb/>A lion-ape hath battened on my child,
<lb/>’Twere shame for us to tell it; it would disgrace

<pb n="8.324"/>
<lb/>My stock. Bahram Chubina knoweth not
<lb/>That that terrific monster will make budge
<lb/>An iron mountain with its breath. Although
<lb/>The daughter of a king be famed, life too
<lb/>Is dear to him.</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>I want revenge
<lb/>For her who was mine Eye, so speak I will,
<lb/>Shame or no shame, and haply gain mine end.</q>
<lb/>Much time thus passed away. She kept her rancour
<lb/>A secret. Now the Khan chanced to prepare
<lb/>A feast and summoned thereunto his chiefs.
<lb/>He sent and called the brave Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And seated him upon the silvern throne.
<lb/>Now when the queen behind her curtains heard
<lb/>She entered quickly, saw the hero, praised
<lb/>And blessed him much, and said to him: <q>May Chin
<lb/>And Turkistan be prosperous through thee!
<lb/>Fain would I ask a favour of my lord;
<lb/>May he accord it me.</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>'Tis thine
<lb/>To order and to will and win thy wish.</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>Near by there is a meadow-land—
<lb/>The very spot for feasting—and therein
<lb/>The youths of Chin keep merrymake each Spring.
<lb/>A bow-shot past the wood thou mayst behold
<lb/>A mount more black than pitch. Upon that mount
<lb/>Of flint there is a monster, and the realm
<lb/>Of Chin is in distress because of it.
<lb/>A lion-ape I term it for I know not
<lb/>What else to call it. By the Khan I had
<lb/>A daughter whom the sun was wont to praise.
<lb/>She left the palace for that feasting-place
<lb/>What while the Khan was hunting with his men.
<lb/>Came from the mountain that ferocious monster,
<lb/>And gulped down her that was our very Eye.
<lb/>Now every Spring it visiteth that meadow
<pb n="8.325"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1958"/>
<lb/>In quest of prey. No youth or paladin
<lb/>Of any name is left in this our city
<lb/>Since through the mischief of this lion-ape
<lb/>They have been slaughtered, and it hath sent up
<lb/>The dust from this fair land. Our cavaliers
<lb/>Of war and men of action have gone forth
<lb/>In numbers to that mountain-height but when
<lb/>They see afar the monster’s claws and breast,
<lb/>Its back, its shoulders, ears, and head, it roareth
<lb/>And shattereth those warriors’ hearts, for what
<lb/>Are lions, tigers, crocodiles thereto?
<lb/>No counter of the cost will venture near.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina said: <q>At dawn to-morrow
<lb/>I will go forth and view this pleasure-ground,
<lb/>And by the strength and might that God hath given,
<lb/>The exalted Fashioner of sun and moon,
<lb/>I will relieve the pleasance of this monster
<lb/>If some will guide me thither when ’tis dawn.</q>
<lb/>Whenas the moon’s disk shone forth from the sky,
<lb/>And dark night shook abroad its dusky locks,
<lb/>They broke up and departed on their ways,
<lb/>Bemused, each to his palace. When the glory
<lb/>Of golden Sol appeared and plaited up
<lb/>Night’s azure tresses, brave Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Put on his gambeson and then committed
<lb/>His honoured form to God. He took his lasso,
<lb/>His bow, a hundred shafts, and one forked dart
<lb/>As used in hunting. When he neared the height
<lb/>He bade his retinue turn back, and when
<lb/>Hard on the lion-ape thou wouldst have said:
<lb/><q>The mount loured o’er him.</q> There mid rocks of flint
<lb/>He girt himself and mounted on his saddle,
<lb/>Armed with his coiled up lasso, plied his bow
<lb/>And strung it, called on God who giveth good,
<lb/>Sent up his battle-cry, and smote the rocks
<pb n="8.326"/>
<lb/>Until they flashed again. The lion-ape
<lb/>Was in a pool. It wallowed and came forth,
<lb/>For when the monster's fell was soaked no shaft
<lb/>Availed against it. That grim monster came
<lb/>To gulp Bahram Chubina down. That hero
<lb/>Shot and the body of the lion-ape
<lb/>Had fight enough. He shot again and smote
<lb/>The monster on the head; the blood poured down
<lb/>Like water o'er its breast. He marked the strength
<lb/>And onset of the monster, shot again,
<lb/>Transfixed its claw, then loosed his lasso, leapt
<lb/>Upon that lofty mountain-top and speared
<lb/>The creature's loins; the flints were dyed with blood.
    <lb/>Then reaching for his scimitar he clave
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1959"/>
    <lb/>The monster’s form in twain, cut off its head,
    <lb/>And flung it down contemptuously, descended,
    <lb/>Came to the Khan, rejoicing, and proclaimed
    <lb/>What had befallen the ape. The Khan and queen
    <lb/>Set forward to the wood and made all haste
    <lb/>To reach the mountain-top while acclamation,
    <lb/>Such that thou wouldst have said: <q>The earth is rent</q>
    <lb/>Rose from the warriors of Chin. They praised
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina and showered gold and jewels
    <lb/>Abundantly upon him while the chief
    <lb/>Of Chin embraced him and bestowed on him
    <lb/>Thenceforth the style of king, and having reached
    <lb/>The palace chose a trusty messenger,
    <lb/>And sent a hundred purses full of drachms,
    <lb/>With slaves and robes, and bade a scribe attend.
    <lb/>They wrote a patent out for Chin on silk.
    <lb/>The Khan at that time gave Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>His daughter to secure his staying there.
    <lb/>As was their custom they made ready robes
    <lb/>Of honour, many crowns and belts. The Khan
    <lb/>Said to Bahram Chubina: <q>These bestow
    <pb n="8.327"/>
    <lb/>On such fravashis as are worthy of them.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina took to feast and chase,
    <lb/>Untroubled by the passing on of time;
    <lb/>The noblest of the cavaliers of Chin
    <lb/>Were his petitioners, and all Chin said:—
    <lb/><q>We are thy slaves and only live for thee,</q>
    <lb/>While he mid feast and largess passed his days,
    <lb/>And all folk too united in his praise.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><head>How Khusrau Parwiz heard of the Case of Bahram Chubina and wrote a Letter to the Khan, and how he replied</head>
<p>
<pb n="8.328"/>
<lb/>Thus matters fared till tidings reached Iran,
<lb/>Reached the great monarch of the brave: <q>A kingship
<lb/>And treasure greater than thine own are now
<lb/>Bahram Chubina’s and untoiled for!</q>
<lb/>Vexed
<lb/>And troubled by solicitude, his heart
<lb/>Wrung by the doings of Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>He held consult with his own magnates, spake,
<lb/>Discussing all expedients, and at night
<lb/>Called for a scribe and made an arrow-head
<lb/>His pen-point. To the Khan of Chin he wrote
<lb/>A letter, and thou wouldst have said: <q>He made
<lb/>His sword the pen.</q>
<lb/>He first praised God, <q>the One,
<lb/>The Guide to good, who setteth up on high
<lb/>Sun, moon, and Saturn, who enthroneth kings,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1960"/>
<lb/>Who pricketh sinners and increaseth Grace.
<lb/>By ignorance, by knowledge, by uprightness,
<lb/>And by perversity, by harm and loss,
<lb/>’Tis owned that He is One and hath no comrade,
<lb/>No peer, no mate. Whoever seeketh good
<lb/>Shall find it but so may not he whose hands
<lb/>Are steeped in ill, and he that maketh choice
<lb/>Of God’s way must forgo ingratitude.</q>
<lb/>He then said thus: <q>Bahram Chubina (may
<lb/>He ne’er in this world see his wishes won!)
<lb/>Was an ungrateful servant to the Shah,
<lb/>Ignoring both his master and his God.
<lb/>He was of small account, unfamed and weak,
<lb/>Till my sire took him up when season served;
<lb/>But when the monarch of the world thus raised him
<lb/>He only did according to his nature:
<lb/>His conduct is well known to great and small.
<lb/>The mighty and the wise rejected him,
<lb/>But thou didst welcome him when he arrived,
<lb/>And take him by the hand as one well born—
<lb/>A thing incredible to upright folk,
<lb/>And not approved by me. Thou hast forgotten
<lb/>Perchance his conduct when thou went’st in fear
<lb/>Because of him. He lashed thee many times
<lb/>Upon the head—a thing that none commend.
<lb/>Thou shouldest not make barren thine own fame,
<lb/>And barter thy tranquillity to him.
<lb/>When they deliver this let thine advice,
<lb/>Now dark, consider well if thou wilt profit
<lb/>By sending us that slave, his feet in fetters;
<lb/>Else I dispatch an army from Iran,
<lb/>And for Turan turn daylight into gloom.</q>
<pb n="8.329"/>
<lb/>Now when the letter reached the Khan, and he
<lb/>Had heard the intention of Khusrau Parwiz,
<lb/>He told the envoy: <q>When thou com’st to court
<lb/>To-morrow morning ask for the reply.</q>
<lb/>The envoy came in haste; he had not slept
<lb/>All night. He waited till he saw the Torch
<lb/>Resplendent of the sun, then made all haste
<lb/>To have an audience of the Khan who sent
<lb/>For scribe with pen and ink and silk of Chin,
<lb/>And wrote in answer: <q>To the Maker be
<lb/>Such praise as magnates give from me, a slave,</q>
<lb/>Proceeding thus: <q>Thy letter I have read,
<lb/>And set the messenger before me. Speak
<lb/>Thou unto slaves expressions such as thine.
<lb/>It fitteth not thine ancient family
<lb/>To disallow the greatness of the great,
<lb/>Or not to make the lowly know his place.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1961"/>
<lb/>Mine are the whole of Chin and of Turan,
<lb/>And the Haitalian crown. I ne’er broke faith;
<lb/>Suggest it not. To break my pledge when I
<lb/>Have ta’en Bahram Chubina by the hand
<lb/>Will make men call me base-born. I fear none
<lb/>Save holy God, but as for thee -if greatness
<lb/>Increase with thee so also should thy wisdom.</q>
<lb/>He set his seal thereto and told the envoy:
<lb/><q>Companion with the wind.</q>
<lb/>Within a month
<lb/>The envoy reached the Shah who when he read
<lb/>The letter writhed and was in fear of fortune.
<lb/>He called the Iranians, told the Khan’s reply,
<lb/>And showed the letter, and the Great, when they
<lb/>Had read it, mused. He gat from them this answer:
<lb/><q>O glory of the throne and crown of kings!
<lb/>Weigh these things well; consult some ancient sage;
<lb/>Let not this letter make thee rash; turn not
<lb/>The torch of former Grace to gloom; select
<lb/>Some old Iranian sage, wise, eloquent,
<lb/>A warrior and a scribe, and let him go
<lb/>Hence to the Khan to speak and hear his views,
<lb/>Inform him what Bahram Chubina was
<lb/>At first and, after, to what ends he used
<pb n="8.330"/>
<lb/>His leadership, and having ordered all
<lb/>Was fain to make a bondslave of his lord.
<lb/>If this be not accomplished in one month
<lb/>Then let the envoy stay a year for why
<lb/>'Twill not be easy to disparage him
<lb/>Because he is the Khan’s own son-in-law.
<lb/>The envoy must be very plausible,
<lb/>And none must gather what his purpose is.</q>
<lb/>Thereafter brave Bahram Chubina, hearing
<lb/>That some one from Iran had brought the Khan
<lb/>A letter, went to him forthwith and said:
<lb/><q>My gracious lord! I hear yon recreant knave
<lb/>Is plying thee with letters. Choose from Chin
<lb/>A gallant host and occupy Iran.
<lb/>My scimitar shall conquer it and Rum;
<lb/>I will salute thee monarch of those lands,
<lb/>And there the watchmen of the night shall have
<lb/>Thy name upon their lips. I will behead
<lb/>Inglorious Khusrau Parwiz, and may
<lb/>No top or toe be left him! I took service
<lb/>That I might root out the Sasanians.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1962"/>
<lb/>The Khan, on hearing, pondered and his heart
<lb/>Was like a wood with thoughts. He summoned all
<lb/>The elders—eloquent, learned, heedful men—
<lb/>Told them Bahrim Chubina’s scheme, revealed
<lb/>What had been secretly proposed and gat
<lb/>This answer from the men of lore, alike
<lb/>From those of his own kin and alien:
<lb/><q>'Tis no light task, but hard, to consummate
<lb/>The measure of the lineage of Sasan;
<lb/>Yet if Bahram Chubina shall march forth,
<lb/>And show the wise the way, he in Iran
<lb/>Will find full many a friend since he will have
<lb/>The Khan to back and help him, and thy fortune
<lb/>Soon will achieve the work. We ought to listen
<lb/>To what he saith.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <pb n="8.331"/>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina’s heart
    <lb/>Revived when this he heard; he laughed and changed
    <lb/>In bearing. All the warriors agreed
    <lb/>That they must choose two young men who were fit
    <lb/>To have command, inured to toil and soldiers.
    <lb/>There was in Chin a noble named Chinwi,
    <lb/>And one Zhangwi—a chief. The Khan sent, summoned,
    <lb/>And made those men of war his paymasters.
    <lb/>He bade them both: <q>Be circumspect in fight,
    <lb/>And ever look up to Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>Alike in times of joyance and of wrath,
    <lb/>Secure the fords of the Jihun and send it
    <lb/>In dust up to the sky.</q>
    <lb/>He gave to them
    <lb/>A valiant host—all chiefs and warrior-lions.
    <lb/>Drums sounded at Bahram Chubina’s portal,
    <lb/>And Sol’s face changed to ebony with dust.
    <lb/>From Chin toward Iran he took his way
    <lb/>Upon Sapandarmad at break of day.

<lb/>Now when the great king heard: <q>The wolf hath come
<lb/>Outside the wood, and bold Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Hath brought a host that robbeth heaven of lustre,</q>
<lb/>He said thus to Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
<lb/><q>Go to the Khan upon this business.
<lb/>Thou art acquainted best both with Iran
<lb/>And with Turan, and with their divers tongues.</q>
<lb/>He oped his treasury and brought forth such jewels,
<lb/>Such scimitars and golden belts, as made
<milestone unit="calced" n="1963"/>
<lb/>Kharrad astound and secretly invoke
<lb/>The name of God. With these he left for Chin,
<lb/>Crossed the Jihun and took unwonted paths,
<lb/>Neared the Shah’s palace, looked around and chose
<lb/>One to announce: <q>An envoy from the Shah
<lb/>Hath come to court.</q>
<lb/>The Khan, on hearing this,
<lb/>Prepared his throne and bade admit the envoy
<lb/>Who, as he drew anear, made eloquent
<lb/>His tongue and did obeisance, saying: <q>Thy slave
<lb/>Will frame his tongue to speak at thy command.</q>
<lb/>The Khan replied: <q>A sweet tongue maketh young
<lb/>The heart of eld. Speak words of profit; they
<lb/>Are pith when spoken but, unspoken, peel.</q>
<lb/>Thereat Kharrad recalled old tales and first
<lb/>Praised the Creator, who controlleth fortune,
<lb/>The Almighty and the Lord of fate, who made
<lb/><q>Sky, earth, and time, high heaven and the world,
<lb/>Who hath all power of right while we are slaves,
<lb/>And tell his righteous acts. To one He giveth
<lb/>The crown and lofty throne, another one
<lb/>He maketh vile, afflicted, and cast down,
<lb/>Not that He loveth this and hateth that,
<lb/>But why He only knoweth. We, both great
<lb/>And small, are born but to return to dust,
<lb/>And have perforce resigned to death our bodies.
<lb/>Begin we with pre-eminent Jamshid,
<lb/>Or with the glorious world-lord Tahmuras,
<lb/>And thus pass on to Kai Kubad and all
<lb/>The Great that we remember—Kai Khusrau,
<lb/>The famous Rustam and by that same token
<lb/>Continue till we reach Asfandiyar.
<lb/>Their share of this world was the charnel-house;
<lb/>They have drunk bane instead of antidote.
<pb n="8.333"/>
<lb/>Our present Shah is of thy kin; he joyeth
<lb/>And sorroweth as thou dost wax and wane.
<lb/>His great-grandsire upon the mother’s side,
<lb/>When glorious Shahs held sway, was Khan of Chin.
<lb/>Now in these latter days our covenant
<lb/>Hath been renewed and everything is changed.
<lb/>May He that giveth victory bless thee,
<lb/>And be thine earth compact of heads of kings.</q>
<lb/>He spake. The Khan gave ear and answered him:—
<lb/><q>O trafficker in lore! if in Iran
<lb/>Be one like thee he knoweth well the sky!</q>
<lb/>The Khan assigned him lodging in the palace,
<lb/>And seat anear the throne, then bade him bring
<lb/>The gifts and give all to the treasurer.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1964"/>
<lb/>The Khan said: <q>Mayst thou lack not worldly wealth.
<lb/>If thou wilt take a present of me speak
<lb/>That I too may accept what thou hast brought,
<lb/>But if not thou art brighter than a gift—
<lb/>The crown of chiefs in knowledge.</q>
<lb/>They prepared
<lb/>For him a pleasant dwelling-place and draped it
<lb/>With stuff of every kind. At board and chase,
<lb/>At feast and drinking-bout this favourite
<lb/>Was with the Khan, sought an occasion, found him
<lb/>One day at leisure and made bold to say:—
<lb/><q>Bahram Chubina is a miscreant,
<lb/>Worse than malicious Ahriman, and selleth
<lb/>Men veteran for what it were not worth
<lb/>A mite to mention. King Hurmuzd was first
<lb/>To bring him forward, raising him by favour
<lb/>Above the sun. Not one knew e’en his name,
<lb/>And yet his will hath everywhere prevailed!
<lb/>Although he doth thee many a kindly office,
<lb/>Yet will he break faith with thee in the end
<lb/>As with the Shahs he did, regarding neither
<pb n="8.334"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1965"/>
<lb/>The Shah nor God. If to the Shah thou wilt
<lb/>Dispatch him thou wilt raise up to the moon
<lb/>The Iranian monarch’s head. Thenceforth Iran
<lb/>And all Chin are thine own and thou mayst dwell
<lb/>Where’er thou wilt.</q>
<lb/>The Khan was stunned to hear
<lb/>Such talk, regarded him with louring eyes,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Speak not such words as these,
<lb/>For thou wilt blacken our regard for thee.
<lb/>I am no miscreant and treaty-breaker
<lb/>Because the shroud of such must be the dust.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <pb n="8.335"/>
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, on hearing that,
    <lb/>Knew that his novelty was out of date,
    <lb/>And made reply: <q>O thou of royal race!
    <lb/>Why dost thou think to speak such words? The Shah
    <lb/>Is better than Bahram Chubina is
    <lb/>For thee because of old relationship.</q>
    <lb/>The Khan rejoined: <q>I will make plain my purpose:
    <lb/>If Caesar broke his covenant by making
    <lb/>Agreement with Khusrau Parwiz shall I
    <lb/>Do likewise and act treacherously against
    <lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina? I possess
    <lb/>A thousand slaves such as Khusrau and come
    <lb/>Of an illustrious race. The king of Rum
    <lb/>Did not oppress thy Shah but gave him treasure,
    <lb/>Land and a host. Since brave Bahram Chubina,
    <lb/>Whose gests are written in the chronicles,
    <lb/>Is my supporter and my son-in-law
    <lb/>How can I draw back from my covenant?</q>
    <lb/>Again Kharrad was foiled and took to guile.
    <lb/>He thought: <q>The Khan is not concerned for us,
    <lb/>Because Bahram Chubina hath suggested Iran to him. My words are willow’s fruit.</q>
    <lb/>In black despair about the Khan he turned,
    <lb/>He had no choice, toward the queen and sought
    <lb/>Among her suite one that could cheer his soul.
    <lb/>He found a steward and was privy with him,
    <lb/>Recounted what Khusrau Parwiz had said,
    <lb/>And made that wretch’s heart rejoice, then added:—
    <lb/><q>Speak for me to the queen that I may be
    <lb/>Her scribe.</q>
    <lb/>The crafty steward answered him:—
    <lb/><q>That will not serve because Bahram Chubina
    <lb/>Is now her son-in-law; she is his brains
    <lb/>And skin. Thou art a scribe; contrive some scheme;
    <lb/>Moreover, let not thy design get wind.</q>
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, on hearing this,
    <lb/>Discerned no top or bottom to his cares.
    <lb/>There was an aged Turkman, named Kulitin,
    <lb/>Whom other Turkmans scorned. He dressed in sheepskin,
    <lb/>And lived withal on millet. Makatura
    <lb/>Was of his kindred, so he railed against
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina, ever cherishing
    <lb/>Revenge at heart and cursing him. Kharrad
    <lb/>Sent to invite Kulun to his famed mansion,
    <lb/>Gave him dinars and drachms, clothes, much to eat,
    <lb/>Invited him to feasts and seated him
    <lb/>Among the chiefs. Kharrad, exceeding wise
    <lb/>And patient-hearted, clever and expert,
    <lb/>Mused much, consulting on one hand the steward
    <lb/>About the queen of Chin but held his peace
    <lb/>When, day or night, he visited the Khan.
    <lb/>The aged steward spake thus to Kharrad:—
    <lb/><q>A man like thee, a noble and a scribe,
    <lb/>If he had skill and was of fame in leechcraft,
    <lb/>Would be a crown upon my lady’s head,
    <lb/>And all the more so as her daughter aileth.</q>
    <lb/>Kharrad replied: <q>I have that knowledge too,
    <pb n="8.336"/>
    <lb/>And, as thou say’st, will take the case in hand.</q>
    <lb/>The steward hastened to the queen and said:—
    <lb/><q>A learned leech hath arrived.</q>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1966"/>
    <lb/><q>Live and enjoy,</q>
    <lb/>She answered. <q>Scratch not thou thy head but bring him.</q>
    <lb/>He went and told Kharrad, son of Barzin:—
    <lb/><q>Preserve thy secret, go announce thyself,
    <lb/>And act the cheerful leech.</q>
    <lb/>That schemer went
    <lb/>Before the queen and found the patient’s liver
    <lb/>Disordered. He prescribed pomegranate-juice,
    <lb/>And therewithal a herb that flourisheth
    <lb/>Beside a stream; folk call it chicory.
    <lb/>He sought to stay the aching of her head.
    <lb/>Within a week, for God so ordered it,
    <lb/>The girl grew like the world-enlightening moon.
    <lb/>The queen brought from her treasury dinars,
    <lb/>A purseful, and five gold-embroidered robes,
    <lb/>And said: <q>Take this unworthy recompense,
    <lb/>And ask what more thou wilt.</q>
    <lb/>He said: <q>Keep these,
    <lb/>And I will ask my guerdon when I please.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><head>How Bahram Chibina was slain by Kulun as Kharrad, Son of Barzin, had planned</head>
<p>
<pb n="8.337"/>
<lb/>Bahram Chubina, for his part, arrayed
<lb/>His army like a pheasant’s wing and marched
<lb/>To Marv. Then one came to the Khan to say:
<lb/><q>Let none pass to Iran from Turkistan
<lb/>Or Chin to tell Khusrau Parwiz about us,
<lb/>And make a gift to him of our designs.</q>
<lb/>The Khan proclaimed: <q>If one go to Iran
<lb/>Without our seal him will I cleave asunder,
<lb/>And money shall not buy him off, by God!</q>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, abode two months,
<lb/>Intent on his close schemes. Then in concern
<lb/>He called Kulun, gave him the seat of honour
<lb/>One day and said to him: <q>None is exempt
<lb/>From secret sorrow in this world. Thou oft
<lb/>Hast begged for millet, barley-bread, and sheepskins
<lb/>From all in Chin, but now thy food is bread
<lb/>And lamb, and thou art richly clad withal.
<lb/>Contrast thy present with thy past estate,
<lb/>Past malisons with present benisons.
<lb/>Thine years have reached a hundred or at least
<lb/>Are great in sum. I have a dread emprise
<lb/>For thee whereby thou mayest gain a throne,
<lb/>Or darksome dust. I will obtain for thee
<lb/>An impress from the signet of the Khan;
<lb/>Then speed as though thou wouldst roll up the earth.
<lb/>Thou must get access to Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And bide thy time at Marv. Don thy black sheepskin,
<lb/>Provide a knife, and go. Note heedfully
<lb/>The twentieth of the month and on that day
<lb/>Approach this man world-famous for he holdeth
<lb/>That day ill-omened as I have observed
 <milestone unit="calced" n="1967"/>
<lb/>For many a year. He will admit not then
<lb/>The public and wear but brocade of Rum.
<lb/>Say: <q>From the daughter of the Khan I bring
<lb/>The mighty chief a message.</q> Keep thy knife
<lb/>Unsheathed within thy sleeve till he shall bid thee
<lb/>Approach alone and as thou dost say thus:
<lb/><q>The noble lady said: <q>When thou dost tell
<pb n="8.338"/>
<lb/>The secret in his ear hide it from others.</q></q>
<lb/>When he shall say: <q>What is the secret? Tell me,</q>
<lb/>Approach him quickly, slit his navel, rise,
<lb/>And seek to flee. All those that hear his cry
<lb/>Will hurry from the chieftain to the stalls;
<lb/>This one will go for steeds and that for treasure,
<lb/>And thou wilt suffer not for slaying him.
<lb/>If they slay thee... well thou hast seen the world,
<lb/>And hast approved its weal and woe. Besides
<lb/>Thou wilt have had revenge and done what use
<lb/>Enjoineth, but indeed none will concern
<lb/>Himself about thee at that time to harm thee,
<lb/>While if thou scapest slaying thou hast bought
<lb/>The world and paid for it, the conquering Shah
<lb/>Will give to thee a city and withal
<lb/>A share in this world.</q>
<lb/>To that sage Kulun
<lb/>Made answer: <q>Need I any further guide?
<lb/>Good sooth! although I am a hundred I
<lb/>Fain would get somewhat so I have no choice.
<lb/>Be both my body and my soul thy ransom,
<lb/>Such is the covenant I make with thee.</q>
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, on hearing that,
<lb/>Sped to the queen and said: <q>The time hath come
<lb/>For me to ask my boon, O gracious lady!
<lb/>And I will tell it. Certain of my folk
<lb/>Across the river are in bonds. Be pleased
<lb/>To set mine own feet free. Procure for me
<lb/>An impress of the Khan’s seal and this know
<lb/>That by so doing thou wilt give me life.</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>He is asleep and drunk: I might
<lb/>Put clay upon the signet on his hand.</q>
<lb/>She asked Kharrad, son of Barzin, for seal-clay,
<lb/>Went to that drunken sleeper’s couch forthwith
<lb/>From her apartments, presently impressed
<pb n="8.339"/>
<lb/>The clay upon the signet, came, and gave it
<lb/>To her petitioner. That scribe gave thanks
<lb/>Therefor, then went and passed it to the elder.
 <milestone unit="calced" n="1968"/>
<lb/>Kulun received that seal, sped pheasant-like,
<lb/>And came to Marv, unmarked. He tarried there
<lb/>Until the twentieth of the month—the day
<lb/>That was unlucky for Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Who was at home attended by one slave,
<lb/>With apples, quinces, and pomegranates placed
<lb/>Before him. All alone Kulun approached
<lb/>The gate and said thus to the porter: <q>Sir!
<lb/>I bring word from the daughter of the Khan,
<lb/>And I am neither warrior nor Persian.
<lb/>That pious lady hath entrusted me
<lb/>With secrets, which for her sake must be kept,
<lb/>For this great monarch. She is ailing too,
<lb/>And is with child. Tell him that I may give
<lb/>My message to the crowned and famous chief.</q>
</p>

<p><pb n="8.340"/>
    <lb/>The noble chamberlain made haste, went in,
    <lb/>Came to the entrance of the warrior’s chamber,
    <lb/>And said: <q>A scurvy-looking messenger,
    <lb/>Clad in a sheep-skin, hath arrived and saith:
    <lb/><q>I carry from the daughter of the Khan
    <lb/>A message to thy potent lord.</q></q>
    <lb/>Replied
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina: <q>Say to him: <q>Display
    <lb/>Thy visage also at the chamber-door.</q></q>
    <lb/>Kulun drew near and from the doorway showed
    <lb/>His head. On seeing an old man weak and wretched
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina said to him: <q>If thou
    <lb/>Hast letters give them up.</q>
    <lb/>Kulun rejoined:
    <lb/><q>I have a message only and will speak not
    <lb/>With others by.</q>
    <lb/>Bahram Chubina said:
    <lb/><q>Approach without more mystery and tell it
    <lb/>Within mine ear.</q>
    <lb/>Kulun drew near. The knife
    <lb/>Was up his sleeve. His villainy grew plain.
    <lb/>He feigned to whisper and then struck. A cry
    <lb/>Rose from the room. Now when Bahram Chibina
    <lb/>Called out the people ran to him. He said:
    <lb/><q>Arrest the fellow. Ask who prompted him.</q>
    <lb/>Then all within the palace came and dragged
    <lb/>That hoary-headed man off by the feet,
    <lb/>The servants in their fury smiting him
    <lb/>With palms and fists. He took the buffetings,
    <lb/>And opened not his lips from noon till midnight,
    <lb/>Then when he had been broken, hand and foot,
    <lb/>They flung him down within the palace-court,
    <lb/>And gathered in their sorrow and dismay
    <lb/>About Bahram Chubina. He still bled,
    <lb/>And groaned. His cheeks were lapis-lazuli.
    <lb/>His sister too had come to him forthwith.
    <lb/>She tore her hair, laid on her lap his head,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1969"/>
    <lb/>Then wailed and cried right bitterly: <q>Brave horseman!
    <lb/>The lion used to flee the woods before thee!
    <lb/>Who hath removed this Column of the world?
    <lb/>Who hath o’erthrown this mighty Elephant?
    <lb/>Woe for the cavalier of chieftain-mould,
    <lb/>World-conqueror, undaunted, lion-queller!
    <lb/>Thou didst not serve the Shah, and no God-server
    <lb/>Was he that smote thine elephantine form.
    <lb/>Alas! who tore this tall, exalted Mountain
    <lb/>Out of the pleasant waters by the roots?
    <lb/>Who hath plucked up so flourishing a Cypress?
    <lb/>Who cast this crown of greatness basely down?

    </p>
    <p>
        <lb/>The wounded man,
        <lb/>On hearing what she said and seeing all


        <lb/>Her heart and prudent counsellings, her cheeks
        <lb/>Rent by her nails, her hair plucked out, her heart
        <lb/>And eyes all blood, her face all dust, though faint
        <lb/>And suffering loosed his tongue and answered thus :—
        <lb/><q>My noble sister! nothing ever matched

        <lb/>Thy counsel yet the measure of my days
        <lb/>Is full. I acted not on thine advice;
        <lb/>A div-like guide led me in everything.
        <lb/>No prince was more exalted than Jamshid,
        <lb/>Through whom the world was full of fear and hope,
        <lb/>Yet erred he at the bidding of the divs
        <lb/>So that he made the world black for himself.
        <lb/>Twas just the same with watchful Kai Kaus,
        <lb/>Heaven’s favourite whose steps were fortunate.
        <lb/>The loathly Div’s incitements ruined him;
        <lb/>The evils that befell him thou hast heard:
        <lb/>He mounted heavenward to look upon
        <lb/>The circling Sky and course of sun and moon,
        <lb/>But fell into the deep beyond Sari,
        <lb/>Headforemost. In like manner hath the Div
        <pb n="8.342"/>

        <lb/>Caused me to err and docked my hand from good.
        <lb/><q>Thine is the royal diadem,</q> he said,
        <lb/><q>From Aries to Pisces all is thine.</q>
        <lb/>I do repent mine evil deeds. God’s pardon
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1970"/> 
        <lb/>Were gracious to me. Thus was destiny
        <lb/>Writ o’er my head; why should I mourn the past?
        <lb/>The water riseth o'er me; grief and joy
        <lb/>Are both as wind to me: twas written thus;
        <lb/>What was to be hath been; none can abate,
        <lb/>Or greaten ills. Thy counsels are mine heirlooms,
        <lb/>Thy sayings are mine earrings. Right and wrong
        <lb/>Are over; call not fruitless words to mind,
        <lb/>But turn to God and place your confidence
        <lb/>Where fortune smileth. He is friend enough
        <lb/>In troubles; tell none of your grief and joy.
        <lb/>My destined portion of the world is mine,
        <lb/>The end is come and now I must depart.</q>
        <lb/>Then to Yalan-sina he said: <q>I leave
        <lb/>The whole host, throne, the kingship and the state,
        <lb/>To thee. Do thou take heed of my good sister:
        <lb/>Thou wilt not need another counsellor.
        <lb/>Part not asunder. May disunion
        <lb/>Ne’er come between you twain. Abide not long
        <lb/>Within this hostile territory. I

        <lb/>Go and present you to Khusrau Parwiz,
        <lb/>Speak and hear him. If he shall pardon you
        <lb/>Hail not another as your sun and moon.
        <lb/>Take many greetings from me to Gurdwi,
        <lb/>And tell him what hath chanced. Make me my charnel
        <lb/>Within Iran, and wreck my palace here.
        <lb/>Much trouble have I suffered through the Khan,
        <lb/>And have not found him gracious for one day.
        <lb/>It was no guerdon for my toils to have

        <lb/>If he shall hear of this, he will not know
        <lb/>What he should think. None save Iranians
        <lb/>Conceived this plan, and had the Div for guide.</q>
        <lb/>He called a scribe and wrote, as there was need,
        <lb/>This letter to the Khan: <q>Bahram Chubina
        <lb/>Hath passed away in failure, shame, and woe.
        <lb/>Be good to those I leave and keep them safe
        <lb/>From toil and trouble caused by enemies,
        <lb/>For I have never wronged thee but ensued
        <lb/>Whate’er was wise and right.</q>
        <lb/>He gave his sister
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1971"/> 
        <lb/>Much good advice, embraced her darling head,
        <lb/>And laid his mouth against her ear, his eyes

        <lb/>All wept him bitterly and lived in sorrow.
        <lb/>His sister in her pain bewailed him sorely,
        <lb/>And kept recalling all her brother’s words:
        <lb/>Her heart was riven by her grief for him.
        <lb/>She had a narrow silver coffin made,
        <lb/>She wrapped brocade around that warrior-form,
        <lb/>With raiment of fine linen neath his vest,
        <lb/>And covered him with camphor, face and all.

        <lb/>Toil not, thou knowest that thou needs must go.
        <lb/>Quaff not thou grief but wine by day and night

<lb/>When tidings came about Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And what his glory had entailed on him,
<lb/>And when his letter too arrived, and when
<lb/>The messenger had told his tale, the Khan
<lb/>Was grieved at heart, his eyes were filled with blood,
<lb/>His cheeks became like lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>Amazed he called his veteran counsellors,
<lb/>And told the fate of brave Bahram Chubina
<lb/>While every one that heard it wept for woe.
<lb/>All Chin bewailed right bitterly and burned,
<lb/>Without a fire, for anguish. Then the Khan
<lb/>Investigated all to ascertain
<lb/>The author of the crime and, when he found
<lb/>That ’twas Kharrad who planned that wicked deed,
<lb/>Exclaimed: <q>How did that dog escape when he
<lb/>Had turned such fire as this on us?</q>
<lb/>Kulun
<lb/>Had two sons living in Turan as well
<lb/>As divers friends and kinsmen. When the Khan
<lb/>Had learned the truth he burned Kulun’s house down,
<lb/>And all about it, flinging on the flames
<lb/>His sons and giving all their goods to spoil.
<lb/>Then when the queen’s turn came he had her haled
<lb/>Forth from the curtains by her hair, seized all
<lb/>Her goods, and heeded not her misery.
<lb/>He sent swift dromedaries everywhere:
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, came not to hand.
<lb/>The Khan grieved long, arraying all his slaves

<milestone unit="calced" n="1972"/>
<lb/>Now when Kharrad, son of Barzin, approached C. 197
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz and told what he had done,
<lb/>And seen and heard, the Shah’s heart joyed for he
<lb/>Was quit of that opponent worshipful.
<lb/>THe showered many drachms, robes, and much else
<lb/>Upon the poor. They wrote to every king
<lb/>And chief a letter in the ancient tongue
<lb/>To tell what God almighty, the All-just,
<lb/>Had brought to pass and how He had sent up
<lb/>Dust from that foe. The Shah too wrote a letter
<lb/>In royal wise to Causar. For a se’nnight
<lb/>They held festivities and called for harp
<lb/>And wine in every quarter of the city.
<lb/>The Shah sent offerings to the fanes of Fire,
<lb/>And robes of honour to the Great. He told
<lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin: “ Thou hast deserved
<lb/>To have the crown and throne,’’ and filled his mouth
<lb/>With royal gems; the treasurer poured dinars,
<lb/>Some hundred thousand, out before his feet
<lb/>On such wise that they grew as high as he.
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Whoso turneth from the way<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Shall have his day bedimmed although he be
<lb/>In battle like the brave Bahram Chubina
<lb/>From whom an ancient Turk hath raised the dust.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The chiefs all blessed Khusrau Parwiz and said :—
<lb/><q>Without thee never be the crown and signet,
<lb/>And if, in spite of all thy loving-kindness,
<lb/>A man would have thy face lack radiancy
<lb/>Then let him as Bahram Chubina be.</q></p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><head>How the Khan sent his Brother to Gurdya, the Sister of Bahram Chubina, with a Letter touching her Brother's Death and asking her in Marriage as his Queen, and her Answer</head>
<p>
<pb n="8.346"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1973"/>
<lb/>Now when the Khan’s heart was relieved and Chin
<lb/>Was all like clay with gore he said one day:—
<lb/><q>Weak men, weak deeds! but I was well content
<lb/>And gladdened through Bahram Chubina’s prowess.
<lb/>Now why have I allowed the hero’s kin
<lb/>To bide in so much weakness and contempt?
<lb/>I shall be blamed by all that hear thereof,
<lb/>And in the future none will trust mine oath.
<lb/>I have not soothed his little son’s distress
<lb/>Or have concerned me for his kin although
<lb/>He was related to me through my daughter,
<lb/>And heart and soul compact of love and wisdom.</q>
<lb/>He bade his brother come and spake at large:—
<lb/><q>Even as a pheasant flieth in a garden
<lb/>Betake thyself to Marv, look on the kin
<lb/>Of brave Bahram Chubina, greet them well,
<lb/>And say: <q>By God and by the throne of greatness
<lb/>I had no knowledge of this villainy.
<lb/>I too am stricken to the heart and wrapped
<lb/>In grief while I shall live, and in revenge
<lb/>Have bathed the surface of the land in gore.
<lb/>The cities curse, but bless Bahram Chubina.
<lb/>Although I should take vengeance for this hurt,
<lb/>And bring the heaven down, one in a hundred
<lb/>Would not avenge so famed a hero’s blood;
<lb/>But no one, as all wise men know, can ’scape
<lb/>From God’s decree. This was assigned to him,
<lb/>And all through the perverse Div’s sorcery.
<lb/>I hold to my first pledge and will keep faith.</q>
<pb n="8.347"/>
<lb/>Convey a separate letter to Gurdya:—
<lb/><q>O holy lady of unsullied skirt!
<lb/>Thou art all uprightness and kindliness,
<lb/>Of lofty nature, far from all defect.
<lb/>Long have I mused upon thy state, while wisdom
<lb/>Hath been in secret session with my heart,
<lb/>And have found no lord fitter than myself
<lb/>For thee, so grace my curtains by thy counsel;
<lb/>Thee will I hold as mine own soul and body,
<lb/>And do mine utmost to keep faith with thee.
<lb/>Then all in this state shall be thine to bid,
<lb/>And I will pledge my heart to do thy will.
<lb/>Now gather all thy friends, discuss the matter
<lb/>Before the wise and see what seemeth best
<lb/>To thy bright mind when thou hast wisely weighed.
<lb/>Let wisdom rule thy words and then inform me.</q></q>
<lb/>That atheling, his brother, heard and like
<lb/>A turtle-dove from cypress sped to Marv,
<lb/>And to Bahram Chubina’s kindred bore
<lb/>The letter and good will, told what the Khan
<lb/>Had said and how he passioned to avenge
<lb/>The slain, then added: <q>Sages and archmages
<lb/>Approven well and vigilant of heart!
<lb/>Herein may much good tidings come to you,
<lb/>And may the almighty Judge befriend the dead.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1974"/> 
<lb/>This sudden death—no trifle—was a thing
<lb/>That none expected.</q>
<lb/>Then he gave the sister,
<lb/>But privily, the letter and the message
<lb/>Sent by the Khan. He spake of their connexion,
<lb/>Her counsel and fair words, of past and present,
<lb/>And of the purity and piety
<lb/>Of women that both counsel and console.
<lb/>The young man spake, the lady of the skirt
<lb/>Unsullied heard him but made choice of silence.
<pb n="8.348"/>
<lb/>Thereafter, when she had perused the letter,
<lb/>And all the words of the imperious Khan,
<lb/>She made her wisdom and her knowledge mates,
<lb/>Thought out her answer and informed the brother:—
<lb/><q>I have perused this letter and held session
<lb/>With wisdom. Just what kings, experienced folk,
<lb/>And potentates would do the Khan hath done.
<lb/>Oh! may our eyes be bright upon the man
<lb/>That seeketh thus to avenge us! May the world
<lb/>Ne’er lack the Khan, and may the crown of greatness
<lb/>Rejoice in him. May care ne’er wound his heart,
<lb/>And may he ne’er despair. We sat in counsel.
<lb/>I read thy letter over, every whit,
<lb/>And all the men of wisdom and of might
<lb/>Agree to entertain this wish of thine.
<lb/>Howbeit all my family are now
<lb/>In sorrow and the subject is ill-timed.
<lb/>When mourning for so great a chief is over
<lb/>The Khan’s commandment shall not be transgressed.
<lb/>I purpose not to go back to Iran.
<lb/>Naught can be better for a virtuous dame
<lb/>Than to be married, but if I shall come
<lb/>In haste what will the wise king say of me?
<lb/>If in the midst of grief I aim at joy
<lb/>I shall not act with virtue or respect;
<lb/>The wise will say that I lack modesty,
<lb/>The Khan himself will think me indiscreet.
<lb/>When four months of this mourning have elapsed
<lb/>I will dispatch a horseman to the king.
<lb/>Meanwhile hear will I what I ought to hear—
<lb/>All that my counsellors may have to urge—
<lb/>And state it in a letter to the king
<lb/>When mine adviser goeth unto him.
<lb/>As for the present, fare rejoicing hence,
<lb/>And tell the Khan the message that I send.</q>
<lb/>She gave the envoy many gifts, and he,
<lb/>A man experienced, left Marv joyfully.

<p>
<pb n="8.349"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1975"/>
<lb/>Then at her leisure that young, prudent dame
<lb/>Consulted with her counsellors and said:—
<lb/><q>A new thing, one that ne’er will stale with me,
<lb/>Hath chanced: the Khan, that ruler of the world,
<lb/>In flattering terms hath asked for me in marriage.
<lb/>He hath no fault; he is a king, great, brave,
<lb/>And master of the armies of Turan.
<lb/>None dared to name me while my Lion lived.
<lb/>For twelve years after I had lost my sire
<lb/>The brave Bahram Chubina took in charge
<lb/>Mine orphanhood and raged when any one
<lb/>Demanded me in marriage. Now the Khan
<lb/>Is not a person of small consequence,
<lb/>And he hath both ability and power.
<lb/>Howbeit when he striveth to make kinship
<lb/>Between the Turks and the Iranians
<lb/>From that bond and connexion time will see
<lb/>Both travail and affliction in the end.
<lb/>Look what it was that Siyawush received
<lb/>Except sun-burning from Afrasiyab!
<lb/>That youth unmatched by other mother’s son
<lb/>Gave from the first his head up to the wind.
<lb/>What did that chieftain’s son too do but send
<lb/>The dust up from Iran and from Turan?
<lb/>Contrive that unknown to the Turks we may
<lb/>Convey this story to Iran forthwith.
<lb/>I have dispatched a letter to Gurdwi,
<lb/>For I had apprehensions on this score,
<lb/>That he might ope my matter to the Shah,
<lb/>And tell my toil and care. God helping me,
<lb/>He will both hear and grant my fair appeal.</q>
<pb n="8.350"/>
<lb/>They said: <q>Thou art for life our youthful lady
<lb/>In Chin and in Iran. An iron mountain
<lb/>Could not displace thee, and thou guidest heroes
<lb/>To manliness. Thou art more shrewd than sages,
<lb/>More full of counsel than wise ministers.
<lb/>We are thy subjects all; ’tis thine to bid,
<lb/>And thine to judge and deal with this request.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this she called the muster-roll,
<lb/>And opened offices to pay the troops,
<lb/>Went forth, inspected every one of them,
<lb/>And chose eleven hundred and three score,
<lb/>Each one of whom would face ten cavaliers
<lb/>In fight. She furnished drachms and then returning
<lb/>To her abode harangued her warlike powers:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1976"/>
<lb/><q>He that hath ever seen a stirrup-strap
<lb/>Is not perturbed because of ups and downs.
<lb/>He feareth not a murderous multitude
<lb/>E’en if the clouds shall shower heads on him;
<lb/>He will not turn from me when I retreat;
<lb/>He will not be afraid when foemen charge.
<lb/>Fare we toward Iran, fare we toward
<lb/>The monarch of the brave. Here in Turan
<lb/>We are but strangers, destitute and friendless,
<lb/>Weak as we are and abject mid the great.
<lb/>Withdraw we then when darkness hath set in,
<lb/>And when our foemen’s heads are dull with sleep.
<lb/>Let not your hearts be straitened on the way
<lb/>If any troops of Chin encounter us,
<lb/>Because the chieftains with their massive maces
<lb/>Will follow us past doubt, but let us each
<lb/>Take his own life in hand and, if they come,
<lb/>Give and get blows withal; but all of you
<lb/>That disapprove of this! abide ye here.</q>
<lb/>They shouted: <q>We are lieges and obey.</q>
<lb/>This understood, they rose and made them ready
<lb/>For war with Chin. Izid Gashasp, the chief,
<pb n="8.351"/>
<lb/>And Yalan-sina mounted with the troops,
<lb/>Who all said: <q>Better perish with renown
<lb/>Than live and let the men of Chin prevail.</q>
<lb/>She crossed the desert to the caravans;
<lb/>She had the camels passed in front of her,
<lb/>And chose three thousand to transport her baggage.
<lb/>At night like some illustrious cavalier
<lb/>She mounted, mace in hand; her charger’s mail
<lb/>Was splendid, and she wore a breastplate, sword,
<lb/>And battle-helm, then led both night and day,
<lb/>Swift as the wind, her host upon its way.

<p>


<lb/>A number of deserters from her force
<lb/>Arrived to seek protection from the Khan.
<lb/>His brother came and said: <q>O famous chief,
<lb/>And lover of the fray! some valiant troops
<lb/>Have made toward Iran, and many others
<lb/>Have sought for my protection. Realm and host
<lb/>Will laugh forever at thy court’s disgrace.</q>
<lb/>The chieftain’s cheek, when he had heard the words,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1977"/>
<lb/>Grew white with anger, and he answered: <q>Haste,
<lb/>And lead an army forth. Observe what road
<lb/>Those troops have taken. When thou reachest them
<lb/>Act not injuriously but first of all
<lb/>Make use of honeyed words, for of them none
<lb/>Hath any knowledge of our usages;
<lb/>Their fear perchance hath turned us into foes.
<lb/>Speak with all unction and entreat them well;
<pb n="8.352"/>
<lb/>Encourage them by loving-kindliness;
<lb/>But if they offer armed resistance play
<lb/>The man and let there be no dallying;
<lb/>Make one tomb for the whole of them at Marv
<lb/>So that the earth may be like pheasant’s plumes.</q>
<lb/>He went forth with six thousand valiant horsemen,
<lb/>Picked Turks, and on the fourth day overtook
<lb/>The Iranians, but that lion-hearted dame
<lb/>Was not concerned beholding them. She left
<lb/>The army, visited as swift as wind
<lb/>The cameleers, disposed the baggage-train
<lb/>Behind the lines, and then surveyed the field.
<lb/>She donned her brother’s armour and bestrode
<lb/>A fiery steed. The hosts were ranked. Each man
<lb/>Took his own life in hand. Tuwurg came forth
<lb/>Before his troops (the Khan was wont to call him
<lb/><q>Old Wolf</q>) and said to the Iranians:—
<lb/><q>Is not the virtuous dame in this great host?</q>

<lb/>For Gurdya was arrayed in heavy mail,
<lb/>And had her waist girt like a warrior’s,
<lb/>So that the valiant billman knew her not,
<lb/>But spurring on his steed and coming near
<lb/>Said to her: <q>Midst this army where shall I
<lb/>Seek for the sister of the murdered Shah,
<lb/>For I have many things to say to her,
<lb/>Respecting both the present and the past?</q>
<lb/>She answered: <q>Here am I prepared to charge
<lb/>A ravening lion.</q>
<lb/>When he heard the voice
<lb/>Of her that rode a lusty lion-steed
<lb/>He was amazed and said: <q>The Khan of Chin
<lb/>Of all the kingdom made a choice of thee
<lb/>To keep him mindful of Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>The Lion and the chosen cavalier.
<lb/>He said: <q>I will requite the favour done
<lb/>If only thou wilt listen to my words.</q>
<pb n="8.353"/>
<lb/>He said to me: <q>Haste unto her and say:—
<lb/><q>If what I spake was not acceptable
<lb/>Know that my words were not imperative,
<lb/>And that I have renounced what I proposed.
<lb/>It is not well for thee to quit our coasts:
<lb/>Attempt it not although thou wilt not wed.</q>
<lb/>Join words together unto this effect,
<lb/>And if she will not take advice use bonds
<lb/>For her and all that have supported her.
<lb/>This is too much!</q></q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1978"/>
<lb/>She answered: <q>Let us quit
<lb/>The field and troops, and I will answer thee
<lb/>Advisedly on all points.</q>
<lb/>He approached
<lb/>That famed and valiant dame who, seeing him
<lb/>Alone, displayed to him her face beneath
<lb/>Her sable casque, and said: <q>Thou hast beheld
<lb/>Bahram Chubina’s horsemanship and courage
<lb/>With admiration: his full sister I.
<lb/>His day is done so I now will essay thee.
<lb/>I long to fight with thee. If thou shalt find
<lb/>That I am worthy of a husband say so.
<lb/>Good sooth! thou mayst approve me as thy spouse!</q>
<lb/>She spake, then spurred her steed. Izid Gashasp
<lb/>Rode close behind her. With her spear she struck
<lb/>The girdle of Tuwurg and pierced his mail.
<lb/>He tumbled headlong, and the sand beneath
<lb/>Ran blood. With chosen warriors Yalin-sina
<lb/>Charged and discgmfited the host of Chin,
<lb/>Slew, overthrew, and wounded many a man,
<lb/>Pursued the foe two leagues and left few mounted.
<lb/>The whole plain was a-stream with blood that day,

<lb/>Victorious she drew toward Iran,

<lb/>With questionings increasing in her heart.
<lb/>She wrote thence to her brother, telling him
<lb/>In sorrow all that occurred, and said:—
<lb/><q>What time the brave Bahram Chubina died,
<lb/>All care and grief fraternal, to us both
<lb/>He proffered much good counsel. May we never
<lb/>Distress his spirit! Furthermore he said:—
<lb/><q>Inform the exalted monarch of the counsels
<lb/>That thou hast heard from me.</q> A mighty host,
<lb/>All men of name and warriors, pursued us,
<lb/>But I have so entreated them in fight
<lb/>That never more will they see fight or feast.

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1979"/>
<lb/>From that time forth the Shah sat undisturbed,
<lb/>Since brave Bahram Chubina was no more,
<lb/>And found no chieftain hostile and disposed
<lb/>To counter him in fight. One day he thus
<lb/>Addressed his upright minister: <q>How long
<lb/>Shall I conceal my thoughts? Shall my sire’s slayer
<lb/>For ever be about me as a kinsman?
<pb n="8.355"/>
<lb/>Now that I have the power and feel aggrieved
<lb/>What should result?</q>
<lb/>They spread the board and quaffed,
<lb/>And put Bandwi in fetters that same day.
<lb/>The Shah thereafter bade his minister:—
<lb/><q>Cut off his hands and feet; he will not then
<lb/>Gird up his loins to shed the blood of kings.</q>
<lb/>They lopped him and he died forthwith, resigning
<lb/>His blood-stained life up to Khusrau Parwiz.
<lb/>The Shah then sent a man to Khurasan
<lb/>With strict injunctions: <q>Hold thy tongue and go
<lb/>Hence to the marchlord’s court. Bid Gustaham:—
<lb/><q>When thou hast read my letter come forthwith.</q></q>
<lb/>The envoy reached in Khurasan the court

<p>
<pb n="8.356"/>
<lb/>When Gustaham heard this he summoned all
<lb/>His scattered troops, set forth upon the march,
<lb/>And passing by Sarakhs and by Amul
<lb/>Came to Gurgan—the country of the Great—
<lb/>Heard that the Shah had grown severe and slain
<lb/>Bandwi, his brother, unexpectedly,
<lb/>Whereat he gnawed his hands, got from his steed,
<lb/>Rent all his raiment as a paladin,
<lb/>And wailing poured the dust upon his head,
<lb/>Perceiving that the world-lord would avenge
<lb/>Hurmuzd on him. He turned back sorrowing,
<lb/>And, thou hadst said: <q>Companioning the wind.</q>
<lb/>Collecting all his scattered troops he marched
<lb/>Toward the forest of Narwan and, when
<lb/>He reached the mountains of Amul, drew up
<lb/>His army in that forest, thence made raids,
<lb/>And thus began a system of revenge.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1980"/>
<lb/>He found a living for all workless men,
<lb/>And where he heard that royal troops were camped
<lb/>Descended on them and destroyed them all.
<lb/>Now when Gurdwi arrived he told the Shah
<lb/>All that his sister with her warriors
<lb/>Had done against the marchlords of the Khan,
<lb/>And how she made their dust go up at Marv,
<lb/>While Gustaham, on his side, was informed
<lb/>That brave Bahram Chubina’s days were done,
<lb/>And that Gurdya with many troops had fled
<lb/>That fierce chief, that a host had followed her
<lb/>To take revenge, and how she had entreated
<lb/>Those famous men of Chin. He called to horse,
<lb/>And from that forest led his troops like wind
<lb/>To meet her. When Gurdya was ware she went
<lb/>Forth with her chiefs and nobles. Gustaham,
<lb/>On seeing them, rode out before his troops.
<lb/>He met Gurdya and was o’ercome by pain
<lb/>And much remorse about Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>Spake also of his sorrow for Bandwi,
<lb/>And wiped blood from his eyelids with his sleeve.
<lb/>He lighted weeping from his steed at sight
<lb/>Of Yalan-sina and Izid Gashasp,
<lb/>And said: <q>The Shah hath slain Bandwi; his day
<lb/>Is over and thou wouldst have said: <q>The Shah
<lb/>Was not his sister’s son. Bandwi bled not
<lb/>For him who used to pour his very soul
<lb/>Out at Bandwi’s feet and lamented him
<lb/>When absent!</q> Now upon the earliest chance
<lb/>The Shah, true to the instincts of his race,
<pb n="8.357"/>
<lb/>Hath severed from Bandwi both hands and feet!
<lb/>So now what hope can ye have in the Shah,
<lb/>For never came fruit from the willow’s bough?
<lb/>He will entreat your kindred even worse,
<lb/>And make meat in the city cheap enough.
<lb/>E’en at a distance he will rage to see,
<lb/>And plan new vengeance on, Yalan-sina,
<lb/>Thou being Bahram Chubina’s general,
<lb/>And having power through him. Let each that knoweth
<lb/>The Shah be ware or better cut his throat!
<lb/>If ye will stay with us we will consult
<lb/>On all things great and small.</q> 
<lb/>The hearers took
<lb/>His counsel; they all shunned destruction’s path.
<lb/>He spake in earnest to Gurdya, recounting
<lb/>Bahram Chubina’s acts. She was o’ercome
<lb/>By what he said, and felt that he was right.
<lb/>All joined him and his clouded counsels cleared.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1981"/>
<lb/><q>Doth not,</q> thus said he to Yalan-sina,
<lb/><q>This lady talk of marriage and desire
<lb/>Its honours?</q>
<lb/>He replied: <q>Wait till I speak,
<lb/>And by long converse ascertain her will.</q>
<lb/>He said to her: <q>O lady! I have seen thee
<lb/>Act as adviser. Thou didst well to flee
<lb/>The Khan, preferring wisely thine own race.
<lb/>What sayest thou to the Shah’s maternal uncle,
<lb/>The valiant and the wealthy Gustaham,
<lb/>The captain and the leader of a host?</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>A spouse that cometh from Iran
<lb/>Ne’er will despoil my kindred.</q>
<lb/>So Yalan-sina
<lb/>Gave her to Gustaham—a gallant hero
<lb/>Of royal lineage—who tended her
<lb/>Like a fresh apple, for he saw in this
<pb n="8.358"/>
<lb/>His exaltation nothing of a fall.
<lb/>The armies sent forth by Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Found their old fortune altogether changed,
<lb/>And Gustaham, on seeing a host o’erthrown,
<lb/>Would spare the troops and take them for his own.

<lb/>Time passed; the Shah’s soul grieved at Gustaham.
<lb/>One day he said in anger to Gurdwi:—
<lb/><q>So Gustaham hath got Gurdya to wife,
<lb/>And those great companies resort, methinketh,
<lb/>To him by her advice. A spy of mine
<lb/>Hath come back from Amul and all is clear.</q>
<lb/>He spake thus till it darkened, and the eyes
<lb/>Of warriors failed, then while the slaves brought lights
<lb/>And wine they sent all strangers from the hall,
<lb/>And holding conclave with Gurdwi the Shah
<lb/>Discussed affairs and said: <q>I have dispatched
<lb/>Great forces to Amul to take revenge,
<lb/>And all have come back wounded and in bonds,<note n="1">i.e, in a state of disability.</note>
<lb/>Have come back full of sorrow and dismay.
<lb/>There is one plan—a trifle when compared
<lb/>With crown and throne. Although Bahram Chubina
<lb/>Erred yet Gurdya was ever on our side,
<lb/>And I have got a scheme, but keep it close.
<lb/>A letter must be written to Gurdya,
<lb/>Like wine-streams in the garth of Paradise,
<lb/>To say: <q>Thou hast been friendly and hast helped me

<pb n="8.359"/>

<lb/>In all things everywhere. Much time hath passed

<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1982"/>
<lb/>But now the time for speaking hath arrived
<lb/>Because Gurdwi is as myself to me.<note n="2">i.e. <q>I may speak now that thy brother is mine own dearest friend and so there is safe communication.</q></note>
<lb/>Look out for some expedient to abate
<lb/>This foul affliction and put Gustaham
<lb/>Beneath the stones; then both my heart and home
<lb/>Are thine. This done, thy troops and partisans
<lb/>Shall find protection with me everywhere,
<lb/>Be nowhere treated with contempt, and I
<lb/>Will give a province unto whom thou wilt
<lb/>That they may act as rulers, and do thou
<lb/>Come to the golden palace of my wives,
<lb/>And thou shalt put an end to my revenge.
<lb/>Thus will I pledge myself with many oaths,
<lb/>And add to these yet more assurances.</q></q>
<lb/>Gurdwi replied: <q>May the king live forever,
<lb/>And be as Venus in the Sign of Virgo.
<lb/>Thou know’st that I regard my children’s lives,
<lb/>My fruitful lands and all my family,
<lb/>However precious I account them all,
<lb/>As worthless when contrasted with thy head.
<lb/>I will send one to her on this affair
<lb/>To give her light thereon. I shall require
<lb/>A letter, written by the Shah and sealed
<lb/>With his own signet, like a shining moon.
<lb/>This will I send my sister by my wife,

<lb/>Soon end as thou wouldst wish. The plan is perfect.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, on hearing this, rejoiced,
<lb/>And thought his cares wind, asked his treasurer

<pb n="8.360"/>

<lb/>For paper, chose words redolent of musk,
<lb/>And wrote a letter like a garden full
<lb/>Of roses like the cheeks of the beloved,
<lb/>Replete with pledges, oaths, and promises,
<lb/>And manifold advice and flattery.
<lb/>Whenas the ink of the inscription dried
<lb/>They sealed the letter with a seal of musk.
<lb/>Gurdwi wrote counsel too, and much besides,
<lb/>Reciting first Bahram Chubina’s deeds
<lb/>Disgracing all his family and land,
<lb/>And adding: <q>‘God forgive him! May his wrangling
<lb/>Cause no remorse in him! Those void of wisdom
<lb/>Heed not the consequences of their acts.
<lb/>Well, he hath gone and we shall follow him,
<lb/>Confiding in the justice of our God.
<lb/>My wife, on coming, will enlighten thee.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1983"/>
<lb/>Swerve not from what she saith or thou wilt make
<lb/>Thy fortune’s visage wan.</q>
<lb/>He put the letter
<lb/>Writ by the Shah inside his own and wrapped
<lb/>Them both in painted silk. The wary wife
<lb/>Took them and heard those peremptory words.
<lb/>She hasted for the forest of Narwan—
<lb/>A woman sent as envoy to a woman.
<lb/>Thereat Gurdya became like jocund Spring
<lb/>With cheeks all grace and colour and perfume.
<lb/>They talked at large about Bahram Chubina,
<lb/>And wept. Then privily Gurdwi’s wife gave
<lb/>Gurdya the letter and made plain the path.
<lb/>That lion-woman saw the Shah’s dispatch
<lb/>And, thou hadst said, looked down upon the moon.
<lb/>She laughed and said: <q>None with five friends would think

<lb/>This matter difficult.</q>

<lb/>She called her five,
<lb/>And stationed them by Gustaham’s bed-chamber.

<pb n="8.361"/>

<lb/>She read to them the letter of the Shah,

<lb/>But kept it from the chiefs in general.

<lb/>When she had said her say she quickly made

<lb/>A compact with them and shook hands thereon.

<lb/>At night she put the lights out and at once
<lb/>Pressed with her hands upon her husband’s mouth;
<lb/>Some of the five too came to give her aid,

<lb/>Came to the couch of that illustrious one.

<lb/>She struggled greatly with the drunken man,

<lb/>And silenced him at last. The general

<lb/>Died in the darkness and bequeathed both night
<lb/>And shining day to others. There arose

<lb/>Within the city shouts and cries for help,

<lb/>In every quarter tempest rose and fire, 

<lb/>And when the dauntless lady heard the din

<lb/>She clothed her in a Ruman coat of mail.

<lb/>That night she called the Iranians, spake at large
<lb/>About the murdered man, showed the Shah’s letter,
<lb/>And so emboldened them. They blessed the event,
<lb/>And showered jewels on the document.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><head>How Gurdya wrote to Khusrau Parwiz and how he summoned and married her</head>
<p>
<lb/>That dauntless lady called for pen and inkstand,
<lb/>And sat at ease among her counsellors.
<lb/>She wrote a letter to the Shah concerning
<lb/>His friends and foes, first praised those that eschew
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1984"/>
<lb/>Revenge, then said: <q>The bidding of the Shah
<lb/>Hath been obeyed as loyal hearts would wish,
<lb/>And through the fortune of the valiant world-lord
<lb/>That great host hath dispersed. What further orders

<pb n="8.362"/>

<lb/>Hast thou to give? What further wilt thou hang
<lb/>On thy slave’s earring?</q>

<lb/>When the letter reached
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz he joyed in her the more.
<lb/>The mighty Lion sought a messenger,
<lb/>High-starred, an honest man and shrewd of soul,
<lb/>And wrote a letter like the Artang of Chin,<note>Arzhang in the original. See Vol. li. p. 19 note.</note>
<lb/>With many blessings in it, summoning
<lb/>The noble lady to the court, and in it
<lb/>Called her the Diadem upon the moon.

<lb/>The envoy came dust-swift to her and told
<lb/>All that the Shah had said. The lion-lady
<lb/>Became like radiant roses in the Spring-tide
<lb/>By reason of that letter, called and paid
<lb/>Her troops, and loaded up when it was day.

<lb/>As she approached the city of the Shah
<lb/>An army met her; when she reached the court
<lb/>The Shah received her, and she found him kind.

<lb/>Thereafter she produced great offerings,
<lb/>As did the chieftains in her company,
<lb/>Exhibited the goods and all the wealth,
<lb/>Then gave them to the royal treasurer—
<lb/>Dinars and kingly jewels past compute,
<lb/>Gold-woven brocade, crowns, girdles, golden thrones,
<lb/>And golden shields. Khusrau-Parwiz beheld
<lb/>That noble Cypress-tree with cheeks like Spring,
<lb/>And pheasant’s gait, with countenance like day,
<lb/>And locks like night, while pearls, thou wouldst have said,
<lb/>Rained from her lips. He sent her to his bower,
<lb/>Gave her precedence there, sent to her brother—
<lb/>His own resourceful minister—to ask her
<lb/>In marriage, took and held her dear as life,
<lb/>While robes of honour, coin, and much beside
<lb/>He showered upon the comrades of his bride.

<lb/>Drew nigh a black steed by the Shah’s command,

<lb/>And vaulted to the saddle swift as wind.
<lb/>She chose her field of action in the pleasance,
<lb/>Wheeled her about on all sides right and left,
<lb/>And pierced the dark clouds with her battle-cries.

<pb n="8.364"/>

<lb/>She told the Shah: <q>What time I fought Tuwurg
<lb/>I was an angry Wolf as I am now.</q>
<lb/>Shirin said: <q>Wilt thou arm thy foes, O king,
<lb/>For she is thinking of her brother’s death,
<lb/>And will, I fear, consign thee to the wind?
<lb/>Thou wearest but a robe upon the throne
<lb/>Of gold, and she can reach thee any time!</q>
<lb/>He laughed and answered: <q>Then provoke her not.</q>
<lb/>The moon-faced lady wheeled amid the dust.
<lb/>She was a heroine in love and war,
<lb/>And said: <q>Would that a foeman of the Shah’s
<lb/>Were here before me on the battlefield.
<lb/>I would unhorse him as I did Tuwurg
<lb/>Here in the Great King’s presence.</q>
<lb/>He was all

<lb/>He said to her: <q>Thou wilt not have to rail
<lb/>At fortune. Let me see if thou art quelled
<lb/>By wine or unaffected.</q>
<lb/>Then she took—
<lb/>That lady-paladin—a goblet filled
<lb/>With royal wine, which Ahriman himself
<lb/>Would have declined, and in the sight of all
<lb/>Quaffed to the Shah and drained it at a draught;
<lb/>She knocked the dust out of that golden stream!
<lb/>The Shah in wonder said: <q>O warrior-moon!
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1986"/>
<lb/>I have about the world four generals,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><head>How Khusrau Parwiz sent an ill-disposed Marchlord to Rai and how he oppressed the Folk there</head>
<p>
<lb/>A long time passed; meanwhile the monarch’s star
<lb/>Sought only the ascendant, but one night,
<lb/>As he was drinking wine among his sages,
<lb/>His magnates and experienced officers,
<lb/>There was a cup in use among the guests,
<lb/>Graved with the name Bahram.<note>The cup had belonged to, or the name on it suggested, Bahram Chubina.</note> The Shah bade throw
<lb/>The cup away whereat they all began
<lb/>To curse Bahram, the cup, and him that wrought it.
<lb/>Thus said the Shah: <q>Now let the elephants
<lb/>Of war tread down the fields and fells of Rai,
<lb/>Expel the folk and turn it to a waste.</q>
<lb/>The noble minister addressed him thus:—
<lb/><q>O thou memorial of mighty kings!
<lb/>Consider that the state of Rai is large,
<lb/>Not one for elephants to trample on,
<lb/>For God and all good folk would disapprove.</q>
<lb/>The king replied: <q>I want one ill-disposed
<lb/>And of low birth to act as marchlord there,
<lb/>One who is coarse of speech and ignorant.</q>

<pb n="8.366"/>

<lb/><q>Do thou, O king!</q> the minister rejoined,
<lb/><q>Characterize the wretch, and I will seek,
<lb/>And bring him, otherwise we have no guide.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz replied: <q>I want a gabbler,
<lb/>Ill-starred, red-haired, foul and with nose askew,
<lb/>With sallow face, malicious, squat, and soured,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1987"/>
<lb/>A coward, vile and gloomy, vengeful, lying,
<lb/>Green-eyed and squinting, with projecting teeth,
<lb/>And humped like a wolf in gait.</q>
<lb/>The archimages
<lb/>Were all amazed that he should speak of such,
<lb/>And all made search about the world, amidst
<lb/>The cities, and among the great and small.
<lb/>One day a man brought one such to the Shah,<note>Two couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>Who said: <q>Tell thine ill deeds in fitting terms.</q>
<lb/>The man replied: <q>I cease not to do ill,
<lb/>I have no wisdom and I say one thing
<lb/>And do another, and snub all that greet me.
<lb/>My stock is lies; I never help the right;
<lb/>I break my pledge and fling nobility,
<lb/>Both root and stem, to garth.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz
<lb/>Made answer: <q>May thine evil star ne’er change.</q>
<lb/>They gave him Rai by patent, so the wretch
<lb/>Grew great by turpitude. They gave to him
<lb/>Troops that had been dismissed. He left the court,
<lb/>Famed for depravity. The miscreant,
<lb/>When he arrived at Rai, put off all fear
<lb/>Of God, and bade the gutters of the roofs
<lb/>Be torn away: this gave him much delight,
<lb/>And afterward he had all cats destroyed,
<lb/>Which gave great umbrage to the householders.
<lb/>Where’er he went he took with him a guide,
<lb/>While in the front of them a herald walked,
<lb/>Proclaiming: <q>If I see a gutter left,

<pb n="8.367"/>

<lb/>Or cat within a house, I will set fire
<lb/>To house and field, and stone the inmates’ heads.</q>
<lb/>He would turn out a place to find one drachm,
<lb/>And vex its owner. All the people left
<lb/>Their homes in terror and gave up their lands.
<lb/>There were no gutters when the rain came down,
<lb/>No watchman in the city. Through the foul
<lb/>And ill-conditioned miscreant that came
<lb/>From court to Rai that city was laid waste.
<lb/>The sun beat down upon the people’s heads,
<lb/>The place was full of pain and wretchedness,
<lb/>And not a soul regarded their distress.

<milestone unit="calced" n="1988"/>
<lb/>Thus was it till the month of Farwardin,
<lb/>And rose-leaves decked the surface of the earth,
<lb/>Until the clouds’ tears grew as large as hail,
<lb/>And tulips filled the valleys and the plains,
<lb/>Till all the dales were dappled like a pard,
<lb/>And earth was coloured like brocade of Rum.
<lb/>The chieftains came to sport within the garths,
<lb/>And to the uplands flocked all sheep and deer.
<lb/>Khusrau perceived the garden’s open gates,
<lb/>The water-birds disporting on its streams,
<lb/>And bade the trumpets sound. They carried thither
<lb/>Jars of perfumes, sat down upon the grass,
<lb/>Called out for wine and decked their souls with joy.
<lb/>A man from Rai approached Gurdwi and told
<lb/>All that had happened. He was grieved at heart,
<lb/>And sought in his concern a remedy.
<lb/>He told his sister: <q>Thou must tell the Shah.

<lb/>See if thou canst devise a scheme to make

<lb/>Its eyes were pitch-like, languishing like those

<lb/>It rode about the garden like a child
<lb/>With saddle-flaps of gold. The Shah laughed out,
<lb/>And laughter took possession of the court.
<lb/><q>What,</q> said he to Gurdya, <q>is thy desire,
<lb/>My gracious lady ?</q>
<lb/>That resourceful dame
<lb/>At once did reverence. <q>Exalted Shah!</q>
<lb/>She said, <q>grant Rai to me, be wise again,

<lb/>Khusrau Parwiz laughed out at his wife’s words,
<lb/>And said: <q>Thou saucy shatterer of hosts!
<lb/>I give to thee the city and the lands.

<lb/>Were subject to him, and his other lieges

<lb/>But be content with his own rank and fortune.
<lb/>He chose moreover of the men of name
<lb/>Out of Iran twelve thousand warlike horsemen
<lb/>That they might march forth to Zabulistan
<lb/>(They left a rose-garth for a gloomy land)<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Ce pays a ferre nuire.</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>And said to them: <q>If any one shall turn

<lb/>Restore him to the path with courteousness,
<lb/>But in worse cases use the chain and pit.
<lb/>Send spies about to keep you well apprised;
<lb/>Ye will have need of outposts day and night,
<lb/>And sleep not in your tents without a guard.</q>
<lb/>Out of the host he called twelve thousand others,
<lb/>All magnates valorous and fond of fight,
<lb/>And having given to them much advice
<lb/>Dispatched them to the route of the Alans,
<lb/>And charged them with the gateway of the West<note>See Vol. i. p. 16.</note>
<lb/>So that no enemy might pass thereby.
<lb/>He bade the chiefs: <q>Be watchful and God guard you.</q>
<lb/>He chose and sent twelve thousand warriors more,

<lb/>He oped his treasuries’ doors and seeing drachms
<lb/>With the inscription of Hurmuz he wept,
<lb/>And gave them to the poor with further gifts
<lb/>When they were clothed. He cut the heads off all
<lb/>The adherents of Bandwi and intimates
<lb/>Of foul-mouthed Gustaham who had rejoiced
<lb/>O’er his sire’s murder. Having made an end
<lb/>Of cursing and revenge he wisely took
<lb/>A new departure, portioning in four
<lb/>The night and day, which make revolving time.
<lb/>At one of these four seasons an archmage
<lb/>Of goodly speech attended to inform
<lb/>The Shah about the host and world’s affairs,
<lb/>Who, if he noticed anything amiss
<lb/>Among the people or the warriors,
<lb/>Would ply forthwith the skirt of justice, learn
<lb/>The facts, and find a way. Another time
<lb/>Was given up to song and minstrelsy,
<lb/>And quiet, careless session with his lords
<lb/>As mighty men should do. The third was set
<lb/>Apart for prayer and praising God, the fourth
<lb/>For study of the starry sky above,
<lb/>Its character, its nature, and its host.
<lb/>The readers of the stars then stood before him
<lb/>Because they were his guides to understanding;
<lb/>But during half of this night-period
<lb/>He sat among the Idols of Taraz.
<lb/>He also made division of each month
<lb/>In four parts that life might be pleasurable:

<pb n="8.371"/>

<lb/>One for the riding-ground, for archery,
<lb/>And polo with some noble to record;
<lb/>Or for the chase among the hills and plains
<lb/>To keep himself in health, and when he left
<lb/>The chase by day or night the affluent
<lb/>Would decorate his route. The second part
<lb/>Was given up to chess and nard and tales
<lb/>Of battle, while the third was for the sages,
<lb/>The scribes and story-tellers, who in turn
<lb/>Narrated to him stories of the past,
<lb/>While in the fourth the Shah received the envoys
<lb/>Of other potentates and wrote his answers
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1991"/>
<lb/>To those exalted chiefs. With robes of honour
<lb/>The envoys, gratified and satisfied,
<lb/>Would set forth from the court and journey home.
<lb/>On that day too for all the provinces
<lb/>He used to write out patents and bestow them
<lb/>On all the chiefs. When the New Year began
<lb/>At Farwardin, and sunshine in men’s hearts
<lb/>Relumed the Faith, he laid a treasure by,
<lb/>Unknown to all his subjects, secretly.

    <lb/>One name into their ears—a private one<note>As a precaution against evil influences. Sometimes children were left unnamed for a similar reason. Cf. Vol. 1. pp. 8, 177, 179 and CMN, p. 36 seq.</note> —
    <lb/>The other name was publicly announced.
    <lb/>The Shah in private called his son Kubad,
    <lb/>But publicly Shirwi of glorious race.
    <lb/>When of that night of birth there had elapsed
    <lb/>Three watches the astrologers approached
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz who asked: <q>What have all those
    <lb/>Who read the stars observed, what will result,
    <lb/>And what is this young world-lord’s horoscope?</q>
    <lb/>They said: <q>Thou canst not scape the sky’s decree.
    <lb/>The earth will be in turmoil through this child;
    <lb/>His army will not bless him. He withal
    <lb/>Will quit God’s path. What need we further say?</q>
    <lb/>The upshot of their travail and those words
    <lb/>Unseemly grieved the Shah’s heart, and he said
    <lb/>Thus to the sages: <q>Take a better view.
    <lb/>Be careful that ye speak no word thereof
    <lb/>Before the Iranian chiefs.</q>
    <lb/>He took good heed
    <lb/>Of that ill horoscope and laid it up
    <lb/>When he had sealed it with his royal signet.
    <lb/>The matter filled him with concern; he gave
    <lb/>No audience for a se’nnight and refrained
    <lb/>From chase and wine. None saw him for a space.
    <lb/>The chieftains all resorted to the archmage,
    <lb/>And held discourse at large to ascertain
    <lb/>What had befallen the illustrious Shah,
    <lb/>And why he gave not audience to his lieges.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1992"/>
    <lb/>The high priest sought the Shah, on hearing this,
    <lb/>And told the army’s words. He answered thus:—
    <lb/><q>Fate troubleth me, and I am all concern
    <lb/>About the process of the turning sky
    <lb/>Through what the astrologers have said.</q>

    <pb n="8.373"/>

    <lb/>He bade
    <lb/>The treasurer: <q>Bring forth the painted silk
    <lb/>With script therein,</q>
    <lb/>The treasurer produced,
    <lb/>The archmage scanned heart-straitened, and was mute,

    <lb/>But in the end said: <q>God is all in all,
        <lb/>For He surpasseth all men’s understanding.
        <lb/>Now if the blindly turning sky presenteth
        <lb/>An altered aspect to the questioner
        <lb/>How can concernment make it turn from ill ?

    <lb/>Why then should any sage suggest such things?
    <lb/>May naught but joy be thine, Heed not their talk.
    <lb/>Fear as heaven soweth and perforce
    <lb/>Must trust thereto. While heaven itself Shall last
    <lb/>At whiles will love and justice and at whiles
    <lb/>Strife and Revenge prevail. From it the body
    <lb/>Hath gain and loss. The understanding soul
    <lb/>Is not afraid. The Maker be thy stay
    <lb/>And comforter, and fortune’s head be laid

    <lb/>He sent as tribute also forty million
    <lb/>Dinars of Rum with forty watchful Rumans
    <lb/>To guard it led by Khanagi—a man
    <lb/>Unmatched in wisdom. Thus with cameleers
    <lb/>Ten caravans went laden with dinars.
    <lb/>When tidings reached the conquering Shah: <q>An envoy

    <lb/>From Caesar draweth nigh,</q> he bade Farrukh,
    <lb/>A loyal marchlord, ruler of Nimruz,

    <lb/>To mount. With him went horsemen of the Shah
    <lb/>With golden helms. When Khanagi descried
    <lb/>Those troops afar he boldly rode ahead
    <lb/>Until they reached the Shah and that famed court.
    <lb/>On seeing his fair face and splendid throne
    <lb/>All louted to the ground and homaged him.
    <lb/>Then Khanagi, his face in dust, exclaimed:—
    <lb/><q>O lord of justice, holy man! may God,
    <lb/>The All-conquering, bless thee, mayst thou ever be
    <lb/>The Shah and glad.</q>
    </p><p>
    <lb/>The chiefs arose and made
    <lb/>Room for him near the Shah to whom he said:—
    <lb/><q>Whose wisdom is like thine? Thou art more bright
    <lb/>Than Sol in heaven, more lasting than the soul
    <lb/>Of eloquence. May this world never lack
    <lb/>A king like thee, and may time bear him fruit.
    <lb/>May none behold the day whereon thy will
    <lb/>Is frustrate; be thy name writ on the sun.

    <lb/>May all be dark to one that joyeth not,

    <lb/>From Caesar goods and tribute and moreover
    <lb/>His blessing.</q>
    <lb/>Smiled the Shah upon that man

    <lb/>The Shah heard Caesar’s letter to the end
    <lb/>With secret joy; the days of mighty kings
    <lb/>Had been restored in him. He gave great praise
    <lb/>To Khanagi and said: <q>Be thou no more

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><head>How Khusrau Parviz answered Caesar’s Letter and sent Gifts</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parviz wrote when the month had passed
    <lb/>A letter couched in wise and happy terms,
    <lb/>Beginning thus: <q>The blessings of the Great
    <lb/>Be on the man who keepeth pure within,
    <lb/>Who seeth God’s work both in good and ill,
    <lb/>And feareth none beside but praiseth Him—
    <lb/>The Master of the sun—who thus sustaineth
    <lb/>The heavenly sphere: and first, thy praises of me,
    <lb/>As instanced in thy letter, I acknowledge,
    <lb/>And I am gratified that they proceed
    <lb/>From sages eminent. I have received
    <lb/>Thy splendid<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> treasure sent and only wish
    <lb/>That thou hadst less concerned thyself. Since God,
    <lb/>The holy Ruler of the world, hath raised
    <lb/>Thy realm o’er Spica, so as to outprize
    <lb/>Hind and Saklab, Chin and Khazar, what manhood,
    <lb/>What knowledge, virtue, and what Faith are thine,
    <lb/>And with God’s blessing! When I was in trouble
    <lb/>Thou didst assist me and remove my griefs
    <lb/>Most wisely. Now I am more gratified
    <lb/>In thine affinity and virtuous daughter
    <lb/>Than any other chief in child, in land,
    <lb/>And virtuous kin. The other chiefs all turned
    <lb/>Their backs on me and passed me by as vile,
    <pb n="8.380"/>
    <lb/>But thou didst take the place of sire to me,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1997"/>
    <lb/>And more. I recognise that thou hast been
    <lb/>A father noble and benevolent.
    <lb/>Next, what thou sayest of the holy Faith.
    <lb/>About your Sundays, fastings, and thanksgivings,
    <lb/>The scribe hath read to me. The words are both
    <lb/>Apt and acceptable, but still I shame not
    <lb/>For mine old Faith—Hushang’s—than which the world
    <lb/>Hath seen naught better, teaching as it doth
    <lb/>All justice, goodness, reverence, and love,
    <lb/>With observation of the stars of heaven.
    <lb/>Sure am I that God is and ever strive
    <lb/>To follow justice. We do not allow
    <lb/>That God hath any partner, son, and consort.
    <lb/>He is and ever will be manifest,
    <lb/>Not comprehended by our thoughts but still
    <lb/>To me the warrant of His own existence.
    <lb/>Now as for these old tales recalled by thee
    <lb/>About the Cross of Christ: a well based Faith
    <lb/>Hath reason for its guide. Concerning those
    <lb/>Who, as thou say’st, are sad because their Prophet
    <lb/>Was crucified yet call Him <q>Son of God,</q>
    <lb/>And say that on the Cross He laughed, if He
    <lb/>Was son He hath but gone back to his Father;
    <lb/>Be not concerned about some rotten wood.
    <lb/>If foolish utterances proceed from Caesar
    <lb/>His letter will be laughed at by the old.
    <lb/>The Cross of Jesus, which Ardshir the Shah
    <lb/>Put in his treasury, is not worth the pains,
    <lb/>And if I send it from Iran to Rum
    <lb/>The land will laugh at me, the archimages
    <lb/>Think that I have turned Christian and a priest
    <lb/>Upon Maryam’s account! Demand of me
    <lb/>Whatever else thou wilt: the way is open.
    <lb/>I look with admiration on thy gifts,
    <pb n="8.381"/>
    <lb/>For which thou hast encountered so much toil,
    <lb/>And have bestowed them on Shirwi that so
    <lb/>I might inaugurate his treasury.
    <lb/>I am concerned about Iran and Rum,
    <lb/>My thoughts all night are like a wood, I fear
    <lb/>That when Shirwi is grown mishap will come
    <lb/>Upon both lands. Beginning with great Salm,
    <lb/>Prolonged by that old vengeful Wolf Sikandar,
    <lb/>What with new feuds and old, the whole affair
    <lb/>Will be revived. In all things that thy daughter
    <lb/>Hath said to me know that she hath restored
    <lb/>Thy crown to youth. She is a Christian still,
    <lb/>And heedeth not my words. She is at ease
    <lb/>And joyful, triumphing in this young Tree
    <lb/>Of royalty. The World-lord help thee ever;
    <lb/>May fortune’s head be always on thy lap.</q>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1998"/>
    <lb/>They sealed the letter with the royal signet,
    <lb/>Kharrad, son of Barzin, took charge thereof,
    <lb/>And then they oped the doors of treasure-hoards
    <lb/>Collected by the Shah for many a day,
    <lb/>And in the first place eight score money-bags,
    <lb/>For coins which Persians call <q>paidawasis,</q><note n="2">See Vol. VII. p. 95 note.</note>
    <lb/>They filled till they were hard as stones with jewels,
    <lb/>Then sealed them tightly. Every bag was worth,
    <lb/>According to the reckoning on the roll,
    <lb/>One hundred thousand drachms. There were besides
    <lb/>Of pieces of brocade from Chin one hundred
    <lb/>And forty thousand, some of cloth of gold
    <lb/>With jewelled patterns, and five hundred pearls
    <lb/>Of purest water and like water-drops,
    <lb/>With eight score jewels like pomegranate-seeds,
    <lb/>Such as a skilful jeweller would prize,
    <lb/>While of the native produce of each land,
    <lb/>Of Hindustan and Chin, Barbar and Misr,
    <lb/>And raiment from Shustar—all that the chiefs

    <lb/>Esteem—he sent three hundred camel-loads
    <lb/>To noble Caesar. He gave Khanagi
    <lb/>A grander robe of honour than he gave
    <lb/>To strangers or his kin, with garments, steeds,
    <lb/>Thrones, trappings, and all kinds of noted stuffs.
    <lb/>In this way too he made up camel-loads,
    <lb/>Ten out of them consisting of dinars
    <lb/>To give to the philosophers of Rum.
    <lb/>The embassy went on its way rejoicing,

    <lb/>That prowest king of earth their benison.

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><head>The Prelude</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>Now will I tell again old histories
    <lb/>About Shirin and Shah Khusrau Parviz.
    <lb/>The book containing them is antiquate,
    <lb/>But that same story bring I up to date
    <lb/>To serve as a memorial of the Great.
    <lb/>Six times ten thousand couplets there will be,
    <lb/>Well ordered, banishers of misery.
    <lb/>For thrice a thousand couplets one may look
    <lb/>In vain as yet in any Persian book,
    <lb/>And if one were to cancel each false strain
    <lb/>In sooth five hundred barely would remain.
    <lb/>That one—a bounteous king and of such worth
    <lb/>And lustre mid the monarchs of the earth—
    <lb/>Should disregard these histories is due
    <lb/>To slanderers and mine ill fortune too.
    <pb n="8.383"/>
    <lb/>They envied this my work and with the king
    <lb/>They have prevailed to spoil my marketing;

    <lb/>My book may then recall me to his mind,
    <lb/>The seed of mine endeavours fruitage find.
    <lb/>Be his the crown and throne while time shall run,
    <lb/>And may his destiny outshine the sun.

    <lb/>While yet his father lived, was young and bold,

    <lb/>But parted from her for a while when he

    <lb/>It was so that one day he willed to hunt,
    <lb/>And all things were prepared as in the times
    <lb/>Of former Shahs. They took three hundred steeds,
    <lb/>Caparisoned with gold, for that famed King,
    <lb/>While of his loyal servitors there fared
    <lb/>Afoot a thousand and eight score, and carried
    <lb/>Two-headed darts. A thousand and two score
    <lb/>Bare scimitars and wore brocade above

    <lb/>And pards and lions chained three score and ten, 
    <lb/>All harnessed with brocade of Chin, all trained,
    <lb/>And furnished with gold muzzles. For the deer-hunt
    <lb/>There were eight hundred hounds with golden leashes.
    <lb/>Behind them came, to harp on hunting-days,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2000"/>
    <lb/>Two thousand minstrels all on camel-back,
    <lb/>And crowned with gold. Five hundred camels went
    <lb/>Ahead, and ’twas their special task to bear
    <lb/>The seats, pavilions, and tent-enclosures,
    <lb/>The tents and shielings for the quadrupeds.
    <lb/>There were two hundred slaves to kindle censers,
    <lb/>And to burn aloe-wood and ambergris
    <lb/>Therein. Before the Shah two hundred youths
    <lb/>Of those attending on him went with posies
    <lb/>Of saffron and narcissus that the scent
    <lb/>Might meet him from all quarters as he came,
    <lb/>Preceded by a hundred water-bearers
    <lb/>To sprinkle all the road, and thou hadst said:—
    <lb/><q>They pour rose-water over ambergris</q>
    <lb/>Lest any sudden blast might scatter dust
    <lb/>Upon that Shah of glorious lineage.
    <lb/>Three hundred youthful princes rode with him,
    <pb n="8.385"/>
    <lb/>Arrayed in yellow, red, and violet.
    <lb/>The king of kings had with him Kawa’s standard, ore crown and earrings, royal cloth of gold,
    <lb/>A golden girdle, armlets, and a torque,
    <lb/>And jewelled buttons.
    <lb/>Now Shirin, on hearing:—
    <lb/><q>The host, preceded by the mighty Shah,
    <lb/>Hath come,</q> put on a yellow vest musk-scented,
    <lb/>And made her visage like pomegranate-blooms.
    <lb/>She wore a red robe of brocade from Rum
    <lb/>With patterns jewelled on a ground of gold,
    <lb/>And placed upon her head a royal crown
    <lb/>Set with the jewels of a paladin.
    <lb/>She left her jocund hall, went on the roof,
    <lb/>And in her day of youth showed naught of joy,
    <lb/>But waited till Khusrau Parviz arrived,
    <lb/>Then let the tear-drops fall upon her cheeks.
    <lb/>At sight of him she rose, showed all her height,
    <lb/>And spake to him with sweetness of the past.
    <lb/>The twin Narcissi bathed the Cercis-bloom,
    <lb/>The first all languishment, the last all health,

    <pb n="8.386"/>
    <lb/>And forty honest eunuchs, men of Rum,
    <lb/>To bear her to his golden bower, his house
    <lb/>Begemmed, then went to hunt with hawks and cheetahs.
    <lb/>When he had had enough of hill and plain
    <lb/>He went back to the city joyfully.
    <lb/>They decked it and the roads because the Shah
    <lb/>Was coming from the chase; the trumpet-calls,

    <lb/>He said to them: <q>For days I have not seen you,
    <lb/>And grieve thereat. I am concerned for fear
    <lb/>Of your concernment and solicitous
    <lb/>About your dealings.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>Thus he spake but none
    <lb/>Replied; they simply held their tongues, but those
    <lb/>Aggrieved and angry looked at the high priest,
    <lb/>Who seeing this rose to his feet and thus
    <lb/>Addressed Khusrau Parviz: <q>O righteous judge!
    <lb/>Thou hast in youth’s day come to be the king,
    <lb/>Hast seen from fortune much of good and ill,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2002"/>
    <lb/>And heard how in the world no stint thereof
    <lb/>Ariseth from the deeds of those in power;
    <lb/>How when a noble race hath been defiled
    <lb/>Defiled too are the mighty sprung therefrom.
    <lb/>Know this, that never hath a noble son
    <lb/>Laid hands upon his father’s life<note>Blood in the Original.</note> unless
    <lb/>His mother had befouled the seed and smirched
    <lb/>Her offspring. Thus Zahhak, the Arab, slew
    <lb/>His sire and brought ill on Jamshid’s head, thus
    <lb/>Sikandar, who poured out Dara’s blood, brought
    <lb/>So great a fire of feud upon ourselves
    <lb/>Although his father called Dara his brother,
    <lb/>While Failakus was wont to call him son.<note>In this and the Preceding line the Pronouns refer to Sikandar.</note>
    <lb/>When sire is pure and mother virtueless
    <lb/>Know that no holy son will come to birth.
    <lb/>None seeketh for uprightness in perverseness
    <lb/>If he is fain to fill his sleeves with right.
    <lb/>Our hearts are sad because a potent div
    <lb/>Is now the great king’s mate, for had there been
    <lb/>No other woman in Iran e’en then
    <lb/>How could Khusrau Parviz thus honour her?
    <lb/>If but Shirin were absent from his bower
    <pb n="8.388"/>
    <lb/>His face would be resplendent everywhere.
    <lb/>Thine ancestors, those wise and upright men,
    <lb/>Ne’er would have thought of this.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>When he had spoken
    <lb/>At great length, and the king of kings returned
    <lb/>No answer, he said thus: <q>At dawn to-morrow
    <lb/>We will assemble here and haply have
    <lb/>The Shah’s reply; our talk was long to-day.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>Next day they rose at dawn and went to offer
    <lb/>Their service to the Shah, and some one said:—
    <lb/><q>It is not right to speak such words,</q> another:
    <lb/><q>The words were wisdom’s mates,</q> a third: <q>He will
    <lb/>Reply to-day, and what he saith should make
    <lb/>For happiness.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>The archimages all
    <lb/>Set forward and with stately steps approached
    <lb/>The Shah. The magnates took their seats and then
    <lb/>A man came with a bowl all furbished bright
    <lb/>As Sol and passed before the chiefs in turn.
    <lb/>Now warm blood had been poured therein. He set
    <lb/>It gently by the Shah. All turned away
    <lb/>Their faces and the assembly was all talk.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parviz looked on them and they quaked.
    <lb/>He said to the fravartis: <q>Whose blood
    <lb/>Is this and wherefore is it set before me?</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/><q>'Tis noisome blood,</q> the archimage replied,
    <lb/><q>And so polluteth him that seeth it.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>When he had spoken thus men took the bowl,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2003"/>
    <lb/>Passed it from hand to hand, cleansed it of blood,
    <lb/>And scoured it out with water and with sand.
    <lb/>Then when that noisome bowl had been made bright
    <lb/>And clean, the washer filled it full of wine,
    <lb/>And sprinkled it with musk and with rose-water.
    <lb/>The bowl shone out sun-bright. Khusrau Parviz
    <lb/>Said to the archmage: <q>Verily the bowl
    <lb/>Appeareth otherwise!</q>
    <pb n="8.389"/>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>The archmage said:—
    <lb/><q>Live ever more! Good hath appeared from ill.
    <lb/>Thy bidding hath turned Hell to Paradise,
    <lb/>And from ill-doing good is manifest.</q>
    <lb/><q>Shirin,</q> Khusrau Parviz said, <q>to this city
    <lb/>Was e’en as this disgustful bowl of bane,
    <lb/>But in my bower she is a bowl of wine,
    <lb/>And savoureth as we. She first obtained
    <lb/>Her ill repute through me; she did not court
    <lb/>The friendship of the Great.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
    <lb/>All blessed him, saying:—
    <lb/><q>May earth ne’er lack thy crown and throne. They grow
    <lb/>In goodness whom thou makest good, and mighty
    <lb/>Are those whom thou hast made so in the world,
    <lb/>For to be Shah, archmage, and chief is thine,
    <lb/>And have withal on earth the Grace divine.</q>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><head>How Shirin murdered Maryam and how Khusrau Parviz put Shirwi in Bonds</head>
    <p>
    <lb/>Thenceforth the greatness of the Shah increased,
    <lb/>And what had been a moon became a sun.
    <lb/>His days were spent with Cesar’s daughter; she
    <lb/>Was chief within his bower. Because of her
    <lb/>Shirin was sore, her cheeks were ever wan
    <lb/>With envy till at last she gave her bane,
    <lb/>And Cesar’s lovely daughter ceased to be.
    <lb/>None wotted of the trick because Shirin
    <lb/>Kept her own counsel, and Khusrau Parviz
    <lb/>Gave her the gilded chamber when Maryam
    <lb/>Had been deceased one year.
    <pb n="8.390"/>
    <lb/>Now when Shirwi
    <lb/>Was sixteen years of age, and in his stature
    <lb/>O’ertopped the men of thirty, his sire brought
    <lb/>The erudite to educate the prince,
    <lb/>While by command an archimage maintained
    <lb/>A kindly watch upon him day and night.
    <lb/>It happened that the archimage one morn
    <lb/>Went to his patron’s and returning found
    <lb/>Shirwi as usual occupied in sport,
    <lb/>Saw that he had in front of him Kalila
    <lb/>And Dimna<note>See Vol. VII. pp. 382, 423.</note> but that the fierce youth was holding
    <lb/>In his left hand a wolf’s claw cut and dried,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2004"/>
    <lb/>And in his right a buffalo’s horn, and these
    <lb/>He beat together as the humour took him.
    <lb/>Such actions, pastime, and behaviour
    <lb/>Vexed the archmage’s heart who boded ill
    <lb/>From that wolf’s claw, the buffalo’s horn, and manners
    <lb/>Of that rude youth, and was in great concern
    <lb/>At what might happen through that ill-disposed
    <lb/>And luckless prince in times to come for he
    <lb/>Had seen the horoscope and made inquiries
    <lb/>Of minister and treasurer. He sought
    <lb/>The high-priest and reported thus to him:—
    <lb/><q>This youth is wholly given up to play.</q>
    <lb/>The high-priest went at once and told the Shah,
    <lb/>Who kept a careful eye upon his son,
    <lb/>On whose account his ruddy cheeks grew pale
    <lb/>In trouble for the future of the world.
    <lb/>His heart was full of pain, his liver ached
    <lb/>At what the readers of the stars had told him.
    <lb/>He said: <q>I wait the Lord of Heaven’s will.</q>
    <lb/>When twenty-three years of the reign had passed,
    <lb/>And when Shirwi had gotten stalwart limbs,
    <lb/>The Great King was displeased because the child
    <lb/>Was lusty grown but not as he desired.
    <pb n="8.391"/>
    <lb/>The monarch’s mind, which else had been all smiles,
    <lb/>Was pained thereat, and he confined the youth
    <lb/>To his own palace with a foster-brother,
    <lb/>Disgraced on his account, and all that were
    <lb/>Attached to him or went to him for counsel:
    <lb/>There were above three thousand more or less.
    <lb/>Their palaces, connected each with each,
    <lb/>Were as a whole the prison of Shirwi.
    <lb/>They decked, draped, carpeted, and furnished them
    <lb/>With provand and the means of giving largess,
    <lb/>With male and female slaves, with wine and minstrels.
    <lb/>The place was all dinars. The inmates passed
    <lb/>Their time in song and feast while forty men
    <lb/>Kept guard.
    <lb/>And now as episodes recite
    <lb/>Tales told by men who thought and spake aright.
    </p>
    </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><head>How Khusrau Parviz made the Throne of Tékdis</head>
<p>
<lb/>Of that throne which thou knowest as Takdís,
<lb/>And which Khusrau Parviz set up within
<lb/>The hippodrome, the origin occurred
<lb/>Beneath Zahhak—that loathly infidel—
<lb/>For when heroic Faridun came forth,
<lb/>And from the Arabs carried off the style
<lb/>Of kingship, on Mount Damawand there dwelt
<lb/>A man who was distinguished by the Shah.
<milestone unit="calced" n="2005"/>
<lb/>His name was Jahn, son of Barzin, a power
<lb/>Within the realm, and for that Shah renowned
<lb/>He made a throne and studded it with gems,
<lb/>So that Shah Faridun rejoiced o’er him
<lb/>When that grand throne was finished, and bestowed
<lb/>Drachms thirty thousand with a golden crown,
<lb/>And pair of earrings on him, and had written
<pb n="8.392"/>
<lb/>On his behalf a patent for Sari,
<lb/>And for Amul. The coast-lands thus assigned
<lb/>Resembled Paradise.<note>Cf. Vol. ii. p. 27.</note> When Faridun
<lb/>Bestowed Iran upon Iraj—the youngest
<lb/>Of his illustrious sons—he gave withal
<lb/>Three things—this very throne, the ox-head mace
<lb/>To serve as his memorial in the world,
<lb/>And thirdly what the just Shah used to term
<lb/><q>The Seven Founts</q>—a jewel. When Iraj
<lb/>Departed these were left and Minuchihr
<lb/>Had joy thereof. Each wearer of the crown
<lb/>Made some addition to that throne, and when
<lb/>It came to Kai Khusrau, the fortunate,
<lb/>He added greatly to its height. It passed
<lb/>In due succession to Lohrasp and so
<lb/>On to Gushtasp who, when he saw it, cried:—
<lb/><q>The work of mighty men must not be hidden,</q>
<lb/>And to Jamasp that man of worship said:—
<lb/><q>What canst thou add to this achievement? Scan
<lb/>It everywhere and see what supplement
<lb/>Thereto will win us praises after death.</q>
<lb/>Jamasp beheld the throne and saw therein
<lb/>A key wherewith to open wisdom’s door.
<lb/>Upon it he inscribed the heavenly host,
<lb/>Which hold the secrets of futurity,
<lb/>And there portrayed by order of the Shah
<lb/>The planet-forms from Saturn to the moon.
<lb/>The throne thus reached the era of Sikandar,
<lb/>Each Shah that looked upon it adding somewhat—
<lb/>Gold, silver, ivory, and ebony—
<lb/>Until through ignorance at one fell swoop
<lb/>Sikandar broke it up; howbeit the nobles
<lb/>Concealed and handed down full many a shard.
<lb/>Thus was it till Ardshir began his reign,
<lb/>And then the name e’en had grown obsolete.
<pb n="8.393"/>
<lb/>He found no traces and so made another,
<lb/>Not as he would, and had small joy therein.
<lb/>He died and left it as thereafter did
<lb/>Those that succeeded. When Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>Sat on the throne and all the chiefs were loyal
<milestone unit="calced" n="2006"/>
<lb/>They spake about that other royal throne,
<lb/>And its past history. Thus said the Shah:—
<lb/><q>Ye chiefs! I ask a favour of my lieges
<lb/>So that I may remake that throne renowned
<lb/>To keep my name in mind. I need the plan
<lb/>Drawn by Jamasp—the favourite of the sky
<lb/>The one adopted by Gushtasp, the Shah,
<lb/>Assisted by Jamasp’s advice and skill.</q>
<lb/>An archimagus reproduced the plan
<lb/>Whereat the exalt Khusrau Parviz was glad,
<lb/>And, this obtained, made haste to reconstruct
<lb/>With joy the throne, brought forth that of Ardshir,
<lb/>And gathered all the craftsmen of Iran.
<lb/>So in the days of that victorious Shah
<lb/>They reconstructed that resplendent throne.
<lb/>The artificers came out of Rum and Chin,
<lb/>Makran, Baghdad, and from Iran itself.
<lb/>Of craftsmen there were one and sixty score,
<lb/>Intent upon the fashioning thereof,
<lb/>And each had thirty workers under him—
<lb/>Men out of Rum, Pars, and Baghdad. The Shah
<lb/>Commanded all to labour earnestly
<lb/>To have the throne completed in two years,
<lb/>And when it was set up high fortune shone.
<lb/>The height thereof was five score royal cubits<note>A royal cubit=a fathom.</note>
<lb/>If thou wilt add thereto three score and ten;
<lb/>The breadth six score for twas less broad than high.
<lb/>A different carpet was laid down each morning

<pb n="8.394"/>
<lb/>Of gold with patterns fashioned of turquoise
<lb/>Were set upon the throne, while every nail

<lb/>Weighed sixty-six miskals. When Sol displayed
<lb/>Its lamp in Aries the desert lay
<lb/>Behind the throne which fronted garden-wards,

<lb/>Stood fronting toward the garden and the fruits

<lb/>The top was all shut in right royally
<lb/>With beaver-skins and sables. A thousand balls
<lb/>Withal of gold and silver glowed like brands<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">Les valets de garde-robe faisaient chauffer au feu, etc</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Upon the fire, each five and twenty score
<lb/>Miskals in weight and coral-hued with heat.
<milestone unit="calced" n="2007"/>
<lb/>One half was in the fire, the other half
<lb/>Was turned towards the noble warriors.
<lb/>The host of heaven, planets, Zodiac,
<lb/>The bright moon in whatever Sign soe’er,
<lb/>And all the bodies, fixed or wandering,
<lb/>Were visible to the astronomer,
<lb/>Who saw what portion of dark night had passed,
<lb/>And how much sky had moved athwart the earth.
<lb/>Among these tables some were made of gold,
<lb/>And what a wealth of jewels was therein!
<lb/>Not e’en an expert could compute their tale.
<lb/>The cheapest ran to some three score dinars
<lb/>And ten; seven hundred would not purchase some,
<lb/>So strike an average. Full many a ruby
<lb/>Was there whose value none could estimate:
<lb/>They lit the night like Venus in the sky.
<lb/>Upon the throne-steps were three rows of seats
<pb n="8.395"/>
<lb/>Enriched with gems. From one row to the next
<lb/>There were four steps of gold inlaid with Jewels.
<lb/>One row, whose ornaments were shaped like heads
<lb/>Of rams, took thence its name; the next above
<lb/>Was known as <q>Lapis-lazuli</q> as higher
<lb/>Than wind or dust-clouds, while the third was all
<lb/>Turquoise, and every one that saw it burned
<lb/>With longing. Rural chiefs and underlings
<lb/>Sat on the Rams’ Heads’ row while cavaliers—
<lb/>Men un-affeared upon the day of battle—
<lb/>Sat on the cirque of lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>The turquoise seat was for the minister
<lb/>That was engaged in governing the realm,
<lb/>And he that sat there must be wise and loyal.
<lb/>A fabric was Spread out of cloth of gold
<lb/>Two score and seventeen cubits long, its fringe
<lb/>All strung with jewels held by golden threads.
<lb/>A map of heaven was inscribed thereon
<lb/>Where Saturn, Mars, Sol, Jupiter,<note>Reading with P.</note> and Venus,
<lb/>With Mercury and shining Luna, showed
<lb/>The fortunes of the Shah; there too appeared
<lb/>The Seven Climes, and peers of Pars and Rum;<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The seven and forty Shéhs,<note>Khusrau Parviz himself was only the forty-third Shah. Shah, however, may be used here in a more general sense so as to embrace Siyawush, Asfandiyar, and others. Mohl has <q>quarante-huit.</q></note> their faces, thrones,
<lb/>And crowns, were shown, those of the kings of kings,

<lb/>A man of Chin, unrivalled in such work,
<lb/>Had given seven years to weaving it.
<lb/>One New Year at Urmuzd of Farwardin
<lb/>He came before the monarch of Iran,
<milestone unit="calced" n="2008"/>
<lb/>And brought that royal carpet to the Shah:
<lb/>The nobles let him pass. He laid it down
<lb/>On New Year’s Day. The Shah's joy was complete.

<lb/>That carpet gave an opportunity
<lb/>For mirth: they called for wine and minstrelsy.

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><head>The Story of Sarkash and Barbad, the Minstrel, and Khusrau Parviz</head>
<p>
<lb/>There was a minstrel who was named Sarkash—
<lb/>An expert—who acclaimed the king of kings
<lb/>With all felicitations on the harp,
<lb/>While nobles showered jewels over him,
<lb/>And hailed him as the Grace of majesty,
<lb/>What while the Shah grew greater year by year.
<lb/>Now in the nine and twentieth of his kingship,
<lb/>When none fared ill at court, Barbad heard tell
<lb/>Thereof, for all folk said to him: <q>The world-lord
<lb/>Affecteth minstrelsy in private life,
<lb/>And thou, if thou wert introduced to him,
<lb/>Wouldst overtop Sarkash.</q>
<lb/>Thereat the man
<lb/>Became ambitious and though well to do
<lb/>Departed to the Shah's court from his province,
<lb/>And noted all the minstrels there. Sarkash,
<lb/>On hearing him perform, was vexed at heart,
<lb/>And, all confounded at such minstrelsy,
<lb/>Approached the audience-chamberlain, bestowed
<lb/>A present on him of dinars and drachms,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is a minstrel at the gate,
<lb/>Who is my better both in years and skill.
<lb/>He must not come before Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>For I am waxing old and he is young.</q>
<lb/>The keeper of the door, on hearing this,
<lb/>Refused the new musician audience,
<lb/>And so Barbad, whenever he approached,
<pb n="8.397"/>
<lb/>Found his employment and his profit nil.
<lb/>When he despaired of being heard he sought
<lb/>The royal pleasance with his harp. The gardener,
<lb/>A man by name Mardwi, revived his hopes,
<lb/>Because at the New Year the Shah was wont
<lb/>To hold a two weeks’ feast within that pleasance.
<lb/>Barbad approached Mardwi forthwith, became
<lb/>Friends that same day and said: <q>Thou wouldest say
<lb/>That we are soul and body. I desire
<lb/>A boon—the merest trifle. When the world-lord
<lb/>Shall come to revel hither give to me
<lb/>The means of seeing him, myself unseen.</q><note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="2009"/>
<lb/>Mardwi replied: <q>I will; my love for thee
<lb/>Shall oust reflection.</q>
<lb/>When the Shah took order
<lb/>For visiting the garth the gardener’s heart
<lb/>Was like a shining lamp. He went and told
<lb/>Barbad: <q>The Shah is coming to the pleasance.</q>
<lb/>Barbad dressed all in green and took his harp,
<lb/>Prepared to sing of glory and of war,
<lb/>And went to where the Shah would be who had
<lb/>Each Spring a fresh spot for his festival.
<lb/>There was a verdant cypress full<note>Gashan. Firdausi might have used this adjective as a thymeword in his alleged competition with the three poets (see Vol. iii. p. 15) but preferred the more erudite Pashan.</note> of leaf,
<lb/>Whose branches, like the battle of Pashan,
<lb/>Extended far and wide. With harp on breast
<lb/>The minstrel climbed it and abode until
<lb/>The king came from his palace to the pleasance;
<lb/>The gardener had the spot in readiness.
<lb/>There came a fay-faced reveller with wine
<lb/>While in the monarch’s hand there was a cup;
<lb/>The world-lord took the liquor from the youth;
<lb/>Its crimson made the crystal disappear.
<lb/>Now when the sun turned sallow, but abode
<pb n="8.398"/>
<lb/>Until night turned to lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>The minstrel in that cypress took his harp,
<lb/>And sang a royal ditty. In that tree
<lb/>He sang a lay so charming that the Shah,
<lb/>That man of wakeful fortune, was amazed.
<lb/>The melody which that sweet voice gave forth
<lb/>Was that which now thou callest Dadafrid.<note><q>The Source of Justice.</q></note>
<lb/>The company were in astonishment,
<lb/>And everyone had his own view thereon.
<lb/>The playing made Sarkash like one insane;
<lb/>He recognised the source, but held his peace,
<lb/>And thought: <q>None but Barbad can play like this,
<lb/>Or knoweth thus the song of paladins.</q>
<lb/>The Shah gave orders to his lords: <q>Search all
<lb/>The pleasance.</q>
<lb/>They searched long and came again,
<lb/>While shrewd Sarkash observed: <q>No marvel 'tis,
<lb/>So fortune-favoured is the Shah, that rose
<lb/>And cypress-tree should serve him as musicians.
<lb/>For ever may his head and crown endure.</q>
<lb/>Then the cup-bearer brought another cup,
<lb/>And as the king received it from the youth,
<lb/>So fair of face, the minstrel preluded
<lb/>In other fashion and forthwith began
<lb/>A different song—that called Paikar-i-Gurd,<note><gloss>The Battle of the Brave.</gloss> This and the preceding are musical terms.</note>
<lb/>A name suggested by the words. The minstrel
<lb/>Sang and the Shah gave ear, drank to the voice,
<lb/>And bade: <q>Produce this man and all within
<lb/>The garden.</q>
<lb/>So they searched the garden through,
<lb/>And carried lights beneath the trees, but saw
<milestone unit="calced" n="2010"/>
<lb/>Naught but the willows and the cypresses,
<lb/>And pheasants pacing underneath the rose.
<pb n="8.399"/>
<lb/>The king of kings called for another cup,
<lb/>And raised his head to hear the voice. Again
<lb/>There came the singing to another tune
<lb/>Upon the harp—the tune called Sabz dar sabz,<note><q>Green on green,</q> anticipating Marvell's <q>green thought in a green shade.</q> Also a musical term.</note>
<lb/>A melody employed in magic arts.
<lb/>On hearing it Khusrau Parviz arose,
<lb/>And that adorner of the garth demanded
<lb/>A cup of wine that held a man.<note>See Vol. i. p. 290 note.</note> He drank
<lb/>The sparkling wine off at a draught and cried:—
<lb/><q>An angel this, all musk and ambergris,
<lb/>For if he were a div he would not sing,
<lb/>Or know to play the harp!<note>In the earlier parts of the Shahnama divs sometimes are represented as being accomplished. See Vol. i. p. 127, Vol. ii. p. 31.</note> Find out the player.
<lb/>Search all the garden and the flower-beds
<lb/>To left and right, for I will fill his mouth
<lb/>And lap with gems, and he shall be chief minstrel.</q>
<lb/>Now when the singer heard the monarch’s voice,
<lb/>And speech so kind and welcome, he descended
<lb/>The branches of the straight-stemmed cypress, fared
<lb/>Glad and triumphant, came and laid his face
<lb/>Upon the dust. Khusrau Parviz said: <q>Speak.
<lb/>What man art thou?</q>
<lb/><q>O Shah! a slave am I,</q>
<lb/>He answered, <q>and live only by thy voice.</q>
<lb/>He told all that had happened from the first,
<lb/>And who had been his friend. The king rejoiced,
<lb/>Like roses in the Spring-tide to behold him,
<lb/>Then spake thus to Sarkash: <q>Unskilful one,
<lb/>Like colocynth while he is sugar-like!
<lb/>Why didst thou bar his access to me thus?
<lb/>Thy harp is banished from this company.</q>
<lb/>Then while Barbad sang on the monarch quaffed,
<lb/>And drained the jewelled cup until his head
<pb n="8.400"/>
<lb/>Inclined to sleep, whereat with watered pearls
<lb/>He filled the singer’s mouth. Barbad became
<lb/>Chief minstrel and renowned among the great.
<lb/>The epoch of Barbad hath past and gone:
<lb/>May ill be never thy companion,
<lb/>For since the day will pass alike of chief,
<lb/>And underling, why should the sage eat grief?
<lb/>Full many have gone—both chief and underling—
<lb/>And I from slumber wish no wakening.
<lb/>When six and sixty years have passed of life
<lb/>It is not good for one to be at strife.
<lb/>When I have ended these my famous lays
<lb/>The country-side will echo with my praise.
<lb/>Thenceforth for me not death but life shall last,
<lb/>For I have flung the seed of words broad-cast,
<lb/>And all of Faith, of counsel, and sound lore
<lb/>Will sing my praise when I shall be no more.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><head>How Khusrau Parviz built the Palace<note>City in text</note> of Madāin</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="2011"/>
<lb/>I will retell the tale of Madāin,
<lb/>Tell of the palace of Khusrau Parviz.
<lb/>A Persian shrewd of heart, o’er whom had passed
<lb/>Years four times thirty, said: Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>Sent men to Rum, Hind, Chin, and other lands
<lb/>Inhabited, and from all climes there came
<lb/>Three thousand famed artificers, of whom
<lb/>He chose two hundred—masters of their craft,
<lb/>Who knew the use of bricks and mortar well—
<lb/>Out of Iran, Ahwaz, and from the Rumans.
<lb/>Of these he next chose thirty and from them
<pb n="8.401"/>
<lb/>Two Rumans and one Persian, from which three
<lb/>They chose a Ruman matchless in the world.
<lb/>That expert came before Khusrau Parviz,
<lb/>And held discourse of plan and elevation.
<lb/>That Ruman worshipful, that scientist
<lb/>Surpassed in speech the Persian. Said the Shah:—
<lb/><q>Accept this contract at my hands and heed
<lb/>These mine instructions: I require a building
<lb/>Such that although my sons and race shall dwell
<lb/>Therein for many a year it will not fall
<lb/>To ruin through the rain or snow or sun.</q>
<lb/>The expert undertook the Shah’s commission,
<lb/>And said: <q>For this thing I am competent.</q>
<lb/>Ten royal cubits deep he excavated,
<lb/>(A royal cubit is five common ones)<note>Reading with P. and T.</note>
<lb/>And laid foundations made of stone and mortar
<lb/>To form a solid basis. When the walls
<lb/>Belonging to the palace had been reared
<lb/>He came before the master of the world,
<lb/>And said: <q>Let now the Shah appoint a man,
<lb/>Exceeding wise and well advanced in years,
<lb/>And send out to the works this man approved
<lb/>Together with some trusty archimages.</q>
<lb/>The Shah appointed men as he was asked,
<lb/>Who went and made inspection of the walls.
<lb/>The artist brought silk which the company
<lb/>Turned to a slender cord by twisting it.
<lb/>Then from the wall-top of the royal palace
<lb/>He measured to the level of the ground,
<lb/>And after measuring the twisted cord
<lb/>In presence of the Shah’s commissioners
<lb/>He took it to the royal treasury,
<lb/>And having sealed it gave it to the keeper;
<lb/>Then going to the court said to the Shah:—
<lb/><q>The palace-walls have risen to the moon,
<pb n="8.402"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="2012"/>
<lb/>But though the Shah bade: <q>Haste!</q> I will not urge
<lb/>The work for forty days but let it settle.
<lb/>The Shah selected me, and when the time
<lb/>Is ripe the palace-wall shall be as Saturn.
<lb/>Let not the Shah’s wrath aggravate my toils.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz replied: <q>Why askest thou
<lb/>Such a delay from me, thou malcontent?
<lb/>Thou must not stop the work but shalt not want
<lb/>For gold or silver.</q>
<lb/>By the Shah’s command
<lb/>They gave the artist thirty thousand drachms
<lb/>Lest he should take it ill. That honest workman
<lb/>Knew that experts would blame him when he built
<lb/>The palace hastily and, if it fell,
<lb/>That he himself would lose his livelihood.
<lb/>That night he disappeared; none saw him more.
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz when told: <q>Farghan hath fled,</q>
<lb/>Poured out upon the speaker all his wrath,
<lb/>And said: <q>How could a dullard give himself
<lb/>Such airs before me?</q>
<lb/>Then he bade: <q>Survey
<lb/>The work and put in prison all the Rumans.</q>
<lb/>He said moreover: <q>Bring artificers,
<lb/>And gather mortar, stones, and massive bricks.</q>
<lb/>Albeit those that viewed the walls took flight
<lb/>Both from the Shah and realm, and he was forced
<lb/>To leave the work alone and turned his thoughts
<lb/>Upon Ahwaz if haply he might find
<lb/>An architect that such an enterprise
<lb/>Might not continue headless very long.
<lb/>He sought for one for three years but they found
<lb/>None of surpassing worth, and people still
<lb/>Talked much about the former architect,
<lb/>Who in the fourth year reappeared. A man
<lb/>Of prudence and of Grace divine informed
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz and presently the Ruman
<pb n="8.403"/>
<lb/>Himself came swift as dust.
<lb/><q>Thou criminal!</q>
<lb/>The Shah said, <q>say what disability
<lb/>Was in the work to make thee lose both wealth
<lb/>And Paradise?</q>
<lb/>The Ruman said: <q>If now
<lb/>The king will send me with a trusty man
<lb/>I will explain to him about my doings,
<lb/>And pardon will ensue on explanation.</q>
<lb/>The Shah dispatched them and they left the palace,
<lb/>The noble artist and king’s confidant.
<lb/>The clever Ruman took the measuring-line,
<lb/>And with the Shah’s own representative
<lb/>Tried the wall’s height and found that it had sunk
<lb/>Seven cubits. Then they carried to the Shah
<lb/>The line. The expert’s comrade made report.
<milestone unit="calced" n="2013"/>
<lb/>The Ruman then spake thus: <q>If I had carried
<lb/>The buildings to their height no wall, O Shah!
<lb/>No vaulting and no work had stood, and I
<lb/>Could not have stayed at court.</q>
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>Saw that he spake, as all should do, the truth,
<lb/>Freed those in prison, whether ill-disposed
<lb/>Or innocent, and gave the architect
<lb/>Ten purses of dinars and to the imprisoned
<lb/>Full many a gift. Thus much time passed away.
<lb/>The Shah was eager for the work’s completion,
<lb/>And after seven years it was achieved,
<lb/>And was approved by wise Khusrau Parviz,
<lb/>Who gave the architect much honour, land,
<lb/>Dinars and drachms and praise. All went to view
<lb/>That palace, and the Shah was wont to spend
<lb/>His New Year there. None ever saw a structure
<lb/>Like that or heard from famous architects
<lb/>Of such. A ring of gold cast for the purpose
<lb/>Hung from the ceiling of the cupola,
<pb n="8.404"/>
<lb/>And from the ring a chain of ruddy gold
<lb/>With jewelled links. Whene’er the king of kings
<lb/>Ascended to his throne of ivory
<lb/>They used to hang the crown upon this chain,
<lb/>And when he took his seat on New Year’s Day
<lb/>The nearest were the favoured archimages,
<lb/>The next below the chiefs, the mighty men,
<lb/>And commissaries, lower down the merchants
<lb/>And other traders, lower still the poor,
<lb/>And those that laboured for their daily bread,
<lb/>And, lowest, many maimed in hand or foot,
<lb/>Or cast down mangled at the palace-gate.
<lb/>Then from the hall would proclamation come
<lb/>That used to stir all hearts: <q>All ye that are
<lb/>The subjects of the monarch of the world!
<lb/>Be not heart-darkened and dispirited.
<lb/>The cares of all that look up to this height
<lb/>Shall end, but look beyond the royal throne,
<lb/>And take ye all the lieges in account.</q>
<lb/>Then no one, whether innocent or not,
<lb/>Was still retained in bondage by the Shah,
<lb/>Who used to clothe his prisoners withal
<lb/>From head to foot and give to them dinars
<lb/>And gifts of all kinds, while all mendicants
<lb/>Within the city that received no share
<lb/>On New Year’s Day he seated at his gate,
<lb/>And flung drachms to them from the treasury.
<lb/>Ill-doers used to fear him, drowsiheads
<lb/>Grew vigilant while proclamation issued,
<lb/>Whenas the time for leaving had arrived:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="2014"/>
<lb/><q>Famed, high-born chiefs! why seek so for addition?
<lb/>Your first concern should be your health and safety.
<lb/>Consider what ye do and ne’er distress
<lb/>The diffident, reflect then act, and heed
<lb/>The sayings of the wise. Regard inferiors,
<lb/>For those of luckless lives demand our tears.
<pb n="8.405"/>
<lb/>A man may slumber at my very throne
<lb/>Unharmed by me if he shall keep the path,
<lb/>But those that clutch at others’ goods, on all
<lb/>That do such things our anger shall befall.</q>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><head>Discourse on the Splendour and Greatness of Khusrau Parviz</head>
<p>
<lb/>The greatness of the Shah I next display,
<lb/>And give new freshness to a bygone day,
<lb/>Such majesty that mid the small and great
<lb/>There is no memory of equal state.
<lb/>Well may the reader of the roll of kings
<lb/>Shake from his skirts all transitory things,
<lb/>And well may I too say a word for I
<lb/>Am well assured of sages’ sympathy.
<lb/>Be not at home in this world for its bane
<lb/>Is greater than its antidote; refrain
<lb/>From greed and strife; make not life’s stage to be
<lb/>Thy home, ’tis but a wayside inn for thee.
<lb/>Fare on. Thou agest and the young anon
<lb/>Arrive; this cometh, that one passeth on:
<lb/>Awhile they strut or batten and are gone,
<lb/>For lion’s head and elephant’s both must,
<lb/>The signal given, come alike to dust.
<lb/>When thou hast heard from me the wondrous tale
<lb/>About Khusrau Parviz keep it in mind.
<lb/>He had such puissance and eminence,
<lb/>Such majesty, such Grace, such throne and crown,
<lb/>That, though thou ask of experts, thou wilt hear
<lb/>Of no one greater. From Turan and Hind,
<lb/>From Chin and Rum and every peopled clime
<pb n="8.406"/>
<lb/>They brought him tribute night and day alike—
<lb/>Boy-slaves and girl-slaves out of every court,
<lb/>And pearls and gems. His treasures and dinars
<lb/>Were infinite; there was no king like him.
<lb/>The wingéd eagle, royal falcon, hawk,
<lb/>Pard, lion, and stream-haunting crocodile
<lb/>Submitted to him willingly: his mind
<milestone unit="calced" n="2015"/>
<lb/>Was bright as Sol. The first of all his treasures,
<lb/>Amassed from Chin, Bulghar, from Rum, and Rus,
<lb/>Was called <q>'Arūs</q>;<note>The Bride.</note> the next of watered pearls,
<lb/>And in an edifice a bowshot high,
<lb/>Was named <q>Khazra</q><note>The Green.</note> by chiefs and Arab sages;
<lb/>The next was known as <q>Bar</q><note>Perhaps <quote>The Spring... (of Khusrau).</quote></note> and lord and liege
<lb/>Have never looked upon its like; the next
<lb/>Was great Shadward<note>The Throne</note> which minstrels celebrate;
<lb/>The next was that which men called <q>Bad Awar</q>;<note>Windfall, i.e., composed of jetsam. Cf. ZT, it. 305.</note>
<lb/>They strove to estimate it but they failed.
<lb/>The next whereof thou hearest speak thou callest
<lb/><q>Diba-i-Khusraui,</q><note>Brocade of Khusrau.</note> and next the famed
<lb/>Hoard of Afrasiyab; none hath possessed
<lb/>Its like by sea or land; another hoard
<lb/>Was that entitled <foreign>Sukhta</foreign><note>Weighed.</note> and its lustre
<lb/>Illumed the realm. Sarkash was of his minstrels;
<lb/>So was Barbad; that market never failed 
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz, and in his golden bower
<lb/>There were twelve thousand girls like jocund Spring.
<lb/>He had twelve hundred elephants of war;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>‘Earth hath not room for them.</q>
<lb/>The war-steeds in the stables of the king
<lb/>Were six and forty thousand, while of camels
<lb/>Red-haired<note>The best sort.</note> there were ten thousand, and none then
<pb n="8.407"/>
<lb/>Possessed one like to them. Twelve thousand more
<lb/>Were beasts of burden, sixty-six were swift
<lb/>For litter-bearing; none had seen or heard
<lb/>Of such from white-haired veterans. Of troopers
<lb/>There were a thousand thousand—men of Rum,
<lb/>Of Chin and Turkistan. He had withal
<lb/>Shabdiz, the charger that ne’er failed in fight,
<lb/>While in his women’s bower there was Shirin
<lb/>To add her lustre to his Rosary.
<lb/>Since he was ruined by a servitor
<lb/>Be not solicitous in quest for more,
<lb/>But rather choose a life exempt from care
<lb/>If thou wouldst have just praises for thy share,
<lb/>For good and evil pass away with death,
<lb/>And time is counting up our every breath.
<lb/>What though thou gainest as thy portion here
<lb/>Throne, crown, and treasury, though thy career
<lb/>Be ever so laborious, yet at last
<lb/>Thy lot among the bricks and dust is cast,
<lb/>So sow but seed of good. Khusrau Parviz
<lb/>Should furnish thee with ample instances:
<lb/>When thou shalt read the roll ’twill startle thee.
<lb/>The famous throne, the seat of sovereignty,
<lb/>Might and the diadem of empiry,
<lb/>Were not sufficient for him but he must
<lb/>Raise from Iran and from Turan the dust!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><head>How Khusrau Parviz turned from Justice, how the Chiefs revolted, and how Gurdz called in Caesar</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="2016"/>
<lb/>The Shah, who had been just, became unjust,
<lb/>Joyed in the injustice of his underlings,
<pb n="8.408"/>
<lb/>Robbed all men of their goods and stirred up strife
<lb/>'Twixt man and man. That which had been a blessing
<lb/>Turned to a curse because the Shah grew like
<lb/>A tyrannous Wolf. He undertook new toils,
<lb/>His one desire was to increase his hoards,
<lb/>Until the folk, who lacked both bread and water,
<lb/>And had not e’en their bodies for their own,
<lb/>Betook them to the country of the foe;
<lb/>The oppressed although unwilling left the land.
<lb/>There was a worthless man by name Gurdz,
<lb/>Through whom the Shah enjoyed both ease and pleasure.
<lb/>He kept a constant surveillance o’er Rum,
<lb/>And was div-headed, tyrannous, accursed.
<lb/>Now when the once just Shah became unjust
<lb/>This man was first to turn against Iran.
<lb/>Another was the favourite, Farrukhzad;
<lb/>None could approach Khusrau Parviz unless
<lb/>Through him, and as the king of kings drew near
<lb/>His end this man too grew corrupt. He came,
<lb/>This offspring of Azar Makdén, a man
<lb/>Of louring face and gruff with underlings,
<lb/>And grew confederate with old Gurdz
<lb/>Till province after province was involved.
<lb/>Gurdz, who was the general, wrote to Caesar,
<lb/>And stirred him up to mischief, saying thus:—
<lb/><q>Arise and seize Iran. I will be first
<lb/>In aiding thee.</q>
<lb/>Then Caesar mustered troops
<lb/>For battle, beat the tymbals, paid his host,
<lb/>And marched like wind toward the Iranian coast.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><head>How Cesar withdrew through an Expedient of Khusrau Parviz and how the Chiefs released Shirwi from Bonds</head>
<p>
<pb n="8.409"/>
<lb/>The king, on hearing, took this grave case lightly.
<lb/>He recognised the practice of Gurdz
<milestone unit="calced" n="2017"/>
<lb/>In prompting warlike Caesar and recalled him,
<lb/>But he excused himself and disregarded
<lb/>The royal letter, for the villain feared
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz, the court, and all the chiefs.
<lb/>The king of kings sat with the Great and all
<lb/>That were the men of leading in Iran.
<lb/>He plunged his heart in thought and sought at large
<lb/>Among all manner of expedients,
<lb/>And when a bright thought came to him he wrote
<lb/>Thus to Gurdz: <q>I quite approve thy conduct,
<lb/>And have commended thee before the lords.
<lb/>This artifice surpasseth all, for thou
<lb/>Hast caused the fall of Caesar. When they bring thee
<lb/>This letter set thy sharpest wits to work,
<lb/>Wait till I make a move, then move thyself
<lb/>That Caesar being placed between our hosts
<lb/>May have his purpose foiled. We will convey him,
<lb/>And all his Rumans, captives to Iran.</q>
<lb/>Then from his court he chose one of resource,
<lb/>Informed and eloquent, as there was need,
<lb/>And said: <q>Convey this letter secretly,
<lb/>As if thou wert a spy, but so contrive
<lb/>That Rumans may observe thee on the road,
<lb/>Interrogate and carry thee to Caesar,
<lb/>Or else before the captain of the host.
<lb/>He will inquire: <q>Whence art thou? Speak.</q>
<lb/>Reply:—
<lb/><q>A subject and in straits. I have been facing
<pb n="8.410"/>
<lb/>Toil and the longsome road to bear Gurdz
<lb/>A letter.</q> Have this bound to thy right hand,
<lb/>And if he take it from thee it is well.</q>
<lb/>The courier went forth from Khusrau Parviz,
<lb/>And made the letter fast to his right arm.
<lb/>A scout descried him as he drew anear,
<lb/>And carried him to Caesar with his head
<lb/>All dust, with wan cheeks, and with livid lips.
<lb/>Then Caesar asked: <q>Where is Khusrau Parviz?
<lb/>Thou must declare the truth.</q>
<lb/>The embarrassed liege,
<lb/>O’erwhelmed with fear, replied with favour changed.
<lb/>Said Caesar: <q>Search this wretch malevolent,
<lb/>Ill-purposed and ill-faced.</q>
<lb/>Shrewd, skilful men
<lb/>Searched him and took the letter from his arm,
<lb/>Then sought a learned chieftain of that march,
<lb/>One who could read aright the ancient tongue.
<lb/>Now when that scribe had read the letter over
<lb/>The monarch’s countenance became like pitch,
<lb/>And thus he said in private to his troops:—
<lb/><q>Gurdz intended to destroy us all!
<milestone unit="calced" n="2018"/>
<lb/>The king of kings with countless elephants
<lb/>And treasure, and three hundred thousand men,
<lb/>Was minded to involve me in his net:
<lb/>God grant his heart and policy be darkened!</q>
<lb/>He dropped his purpose and withdrew his host.
<lb/>Gurdz, informed that Caesar had returned
<lb/>To Rum, grew pale and sorrowful. He chose
<lb/>A horseman from his troops and wrote this letter
<lb/>With sighs and loud complainings: <q>Why is Caesar
<lb/>Displeased with me? Say wherefore hast thou quitted Iran and made me shift thus for myself?
<lb/>The king of kings, informed of what I did,
<lb/>In pain and vengeance is estranged from me.</q>
<pb n="8.411"/>
<lb/>When Caesar was aware of this and saw
<lb/>That letter he selected from his host
<lb/>A noble and dispatched him to Gurdz
<lb/>In haste to say: <q>Hath God so furnished thee
<lb/>That thou shouldst desolate my crown and throne,
<lb/>And burn my troops with fire? Thy former letter,
<lb/>Thou miscreant! came but to consign to wind
<lb/>My treasure, and the purpose was to give me
<lb/>Up to Khusrau Parviz. May good estate
<lb/>And greatness ne’er be thine! Thou shouldst have known
<lb/>That while they see a Shah of royal race
<lb/>The Iranians will desire no alien,
<lb/>None born of Caesar, none however wise.</q>
<lb/>Gurdz protested unto Caesar much,
<lb/>But failed to gain an access to his ear.
<lb/>Khusrau Parviz then chose as messenger
<lb/>A Persian who was learned and eloquent,
<lb/>And sent him with this letter to Gurdz:—
<lb/><q>Thou worthless villain, worker for the Div!
<lb/>These many times I summon thee to Court,
<lb/>But thou art far from loyalty and right.
<lb/>Now all the army that thou hast with thee,
<lb/>For many years thy fortune’s fosterers,
<lb/>Are backing Caesar both in heart and will,
<lb/>And privily are not as they appear.
<lb/>Dispatch to me the disaffected rebels.</q>
<lb/>When this arrived the wary chieftain mused.
<lb/>He chose twelve thousand valiant cavaliers,
<lb/>And thus addressed them: <q>Be ye one in heart,
<lb/>And heed ye not what any one may say.
<lb/>Abide awhile on this side of the stream,
<lb/>And hurry not at all upon the march.
<lb/>If ye are one in tongue and confidence
<lb/>Ye may uproot a mountain.</q>
<lb/>Young and old
<pb n="8.412"/>
<lb/>Advanced as far as Khurra-i-Ardshir,<note>Khurra-i-Ardshir was a district in Pars. Bih-Ardshir (Seleucia) must be meant.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="2019"/>
<lb/>Advanced until they reached the river-bank,
<lb/>Expectant of the bidding of the king,
<lb/>Who, hearing, was not anxious to behold them,
<lb/>But ordered Farrukhzad to go and say:—
<lb/><q>Till now ye have been loyal; wherefore then
<lb/>Allowed ye Caesar to invade us thus?
<lb/>Who hath transgressed the way of God and quitted
<lb/>The path of duty and of loyalty?</q>
<lb/>The faces of the soldiers at that message,
<lb/>Sent by Khusrau Parviz, grew dark with fear.
<lb/>None dared to speak but tarried pained and pale.
<lb/>The messenger was with Gurdz at heart,
<lb/>But kept his secret both from wind and dust.
<lb/>He then approached the leaders privily,
<lb/>And threw some light upon their darkened minds.
<lb/><q>Fear not,</q> he said, <q>ye chieftains! for the Shah
<lb/>Hath not detected you in open fault.
<lb/>Be of one heart and tongue, and say to him:—
<lb/><q>What disaffected person is with us?
<lb/>And if there be one cloak is over all;
<lb/>We stand by one another lustily.</q></q>
<lb/>The chiefs all heard him, understood, rose up,
<lb/>And framed their answer on the lines proposed.
<lb/>Then Farrukhzad returned like flying dust,
<lb/>And told the Shah their words, who said: <q>Go back,
<lb/>And say: <q>Which of you seeketh his own hurt?
<lb/>The man that hath been duped by luckless Caesar
<lb/>With gifts of treasures, weapons, crowns, and thrones,
<lb/>That man is guilty in respect to us—
<lb/>A traitor to this crown and majesty.
<lb/>Dispatch ye to my court without delay
<lb/>All that are disaffected in this wise,
<lb/>Else all of you that have transgressed shall see
<pb n="8.413"/>
<lb/>The gibbet and the dungeon.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>Farrukhzad
    <lb/>Went with these words, and in the soldiers’ hearts
    <lb/>Old grievances revived. None dared to speak,
    <lb/>But kept a mournful silence. Thereupon
    <lb/>Spake Farrukhzad and in unseemly words :—
    <lb/><q>In all this young and valiant host I see
    <lb/>None inefficient; why then fear the Shah,
    <lb/>Whose troops are scattered through Rum? I note
    <lb/>At court no great man to illuminate
    <lb/>His star and moon. Despise my words and fear not
 
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2020"/>
    <lb/>My threats, but curse me and the exalted Shah.</q>
    <lb/>The hearers knew: <q>The fortune of the king
    <lb/>Hath aged,</q> and framed their lips for malisons,
    <lb/>While Farrukhzad went to Khusrau Parwiz,
    <lb/>And said: <q>The troops all stand by one another,
    <lb/>And if thou sendest me again I fear
    <lb/>For mine own life.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz perceived :—
    <lb/><q>This knave will cause both blood and tears to flow,</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>But fearful of his brother<note n="1">Rustam, the brother of Farrukhzad not of Khusrau Parwiz as given in the Genealogical Table of the Sasanians in Vol. vi. p. 3.</note> answered not,
    <lb/>And hid the truth; for Rustam had revolted
    <lb/>Where he was stationed with ten thousand swordsmen,
    <lb/>And holding Farrukhzad disloyal too
    <lb/>Caused his own soldiers to revolt withal,
    <lb/>While Farrukhzad was ware too that the Shah
    <lb/>Knew him as author of the host’s default;
    <lb/>So when that malcontent had left the presence
    <lb/>He dared not to return but kept without,
    <lb/>And tampered there with all the folk, for ever
    <lb/>Attempting to pervert them, man by man,
    <lb/>From their obedience to the Shah. He told
  
    <lb/>Them all and they agreed: <q>Another Shah
        <pb n="8.414"/>
    <lb/>Should sit upon the throne for this hath lost
    <lb/>The Grace, the royal usages, and fortune.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>There was with Farrukhzad an ancient man,
    <lb/>Skilled in affairs, who said: <q>The Shah imputeth
    <lb/>The army’s fault to thee. Thou must produce
    <lb/>A new king soon because our fertile land
    <lb/>Is growing waste, its tumult as destructive
    <lb/>As was Piran. We needs must ascertain
    <lb/>Which of the Shah’s sons hath most modesty,
    <lb/>And will cause least dispute. He must be seated
    <lb/>Upon the throne as Shah and o’er his crown
    <lb/>Dinars be showered. Then we shall fare anew;
    <lb/>We have drunk bitter and we shall drink sweet,
    <lb/>For since Shirwi,<note n="2">Cf. p. 193.</note> the shrewd and eldest-born,
    <lb/>Is now in prison we shall need no other.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>They all agreed thereto. But few elapsed
    <lb/>Of days and nights before Talikan’s host raised
    <lb/>The dust and slighted all the Shah’s affairs.
    <lb/>Then Farrukhzad went out to meet Talikan
    <lb/>With many troops. They met and much talk passed
    <lb/>In public and in private. Farrukhzad,
    <lb/>Moreover, loosed his tongue and told the ills
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2021"/>
    <lb/>Wrought by Khusrau Parwiz. He said: <q>The host
    <lb/>By valour and by counsel will restore
    <lb/>The sovereignty.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>The general replied :—
    <lb/><q>I am not one for words but when I come
    <lb/>To battle with my troops I make things strait
    <lb/>For this world’s warriors. This king when young
    <lb/>Was loved by chief and paladin, and since
    <lb/>The days of such an one as he grow dark
    <lb/>I would that none should look on crown and throne.
    <lb/>The fatal time was when he grew unjust,
    <lb/>And joyed in the injustice of his slaves.</q>

<p>
    <lb/>When Farrukhzad heard this<note n="3">Reading with P.</note> he chose Talikan,
    <pb n="8.415"/>
    <lb/>And said to him: <q>Now go we to the prison,
    <lb/>To those unfortunates, and boldly bear
    <lb/>Shirwi, the brave, the atheling, away.
    <lb/>The captain of the host, whose brain and skin
    <lb/>Thou wilt take sooner, watcheth o’er his prison,
    <lb/>And with six thousand proven cavaliers
    <lb/>Is keeper of those wretched prisoners.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>Talikan thus answered: <q>We have overlooked
    <lb/>This matter of the captain of the host,
    <lb/>For if the fortune of Khusrau Parwiz
    <lb/>Revive there will not be a paladin
    <lb/>Left in Iran, and what with gibbet, bonds,
    <lb/>And dungeon, none will ’scape calamity.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>He spake and urged his charger, speeding like
    <lb/>Azargashasp, and led his powers to battle.
    <lb/>The captain of the host encountered him
    <lb/>Forthwith. Those famous troops were overthrown,
    <lb/>The captain of the host himself was slain
    <lb/>In fight, the forces of the king were scattered,
    <lb/>The day was one of gloom and all was lost.
    <lb/>By that expedient and in war-array
    <lb/>Talikan made entry of that narrow prison,
    <lb/>And called exult Shirwi. The prince replied
    <lb/>Forthwith, well knowing why that chief had come.
    <lb/>His heart throbbed, laughing after care, when he
    <lb/>Beheld that cheerful face, but still he wept,
    <lb/>And asked: <q>Where is Khusrau Parwiz? Is’t thine
    <lb/>To free me?</q>
    <lb/>Said Talikan: <q>As thou’rt a man
    <lb/>Be not perverse, for if thou wilt consent not,
    <lb/>And lettest go this opportunity,
    <lb/>One in sixteen may fail us, but thou hast
    <lb/>Still fifteen brothers left and each deserving
    <lb/>To be the king of kings: the throne of greatness
    <lb/>Would joy in them.</q>
</p>
<p><pb n="8.416"/>
    <lb/>Shirwi remained in tears
    <lb/>And consternation. Should he quit the prison?
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2022"/>
    <lb/>Now Farrukhzad meanwhile was at the gates,
    <lb/>And suffered none to pass to tell the Shah,
    <lb/>But acted as sole chamberlain. When Sol
    <lb/>Grew wan of face, and all the lords had gone
    <lb/>To seek repose, he bade the watch or them
    <lb/>That were its officers to fare to court—
    <lb/>That place of happiness and royal ease—
    <lb/>And said: <q>Your cry to-night must not be that
    <lb/>Of yesternight: all watchmen every watch
    <lb/>Must in their cries employ the name <q>Kubad.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>They made reply: <q>We will; we will forget
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz.</q>
    <lb/>So when the night resumed
    <lb/>Its pitch-like robe from city and bazar
    <lb/>Arose the cry: <q>For ever live Kubad,
    <lb/>The scion of the great, and may his name
    <lb/>Be promulgate in all the provinces.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>The night was dark; the monarch of the world
    <lb/>Slept but Shirin beside him was perturbed,
    <lb/>On hearing what the watchman said, and grieved.
    <lb/>Her heart beat fast with care. Roused by her voice
    <lb/>The Shah took dudgeon, but she cried: <q>O sire!
    <lb/>What shall we do? How shall we act herein?</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>He said: <q>O moon-face! why dost chatter so
    <lb/>When I am sleeping?</q>
    <lb/>She replied: <q>Give ear,
    <lb/>And listen to the watch.</q>
    <lb/>He heard; his cheeks
    <lb/>Became like flowers of fenugreek; he said: —
    <lb/><q>What time three watches of the night have passed
    <lb/>Consult the astrologers for when this knave
    <lb/>Was born I named him privily Kubad,
    <pb n="8.417"/>
    <lb/>But I have spoken of him as Shirwi,
    <lb/>And kept his other name concealed. In public
    <lb/>Shirwi hath always been his name, so why
    <lb/>Is this vile fellow calling him Kubad?
    <lb/>We must depart while it is night toward Chin,
    <lb/>Machin or else Makran, and I will ask
    <lb/>Faghfur for troops, and make our way to them
    <lb/>By some device.</q>
    <lb/>But as his star was dark
    <lb/>In heaven so on earth his words were wild:
    <lb/>His scheme of night-departure came to naught.
    <lb/>He took a hard case easily and told
    <lb/>Shirin: <q>The time hath come; our foes prevent
    <lb/>Our schemes.</q>
    <lb/>She answered him: <q>For ever live:
    <lb/>Far from thee ever be the evil eye.
    <lb/>Plan in thy wisdom something for thyself:
    <lb/>Ne’er may the foeman have of thee his will.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2023"/>   
    <lb/>As soon as it is light that ruseful one 
    <lb/>Will turn toward the palace past all doubt.</q>


</p>
<p>
    <lb/>He called for armour from the treasury—
    <lb/>Two Indian scimitars and Ruman casque,
    <lb/>A quiver, arrows, and a golden shield—
    <lb/>And for a valiant slave who loved the fight.
    <lb/>He went forth to the garden in the dark,
    <lb/>What time the crow awakeneth, hung up
    <lb/>His golden buckler on a bough where none
    <lb/>Was like to pass and with a heavy sword
    <lb/>Beneath his knee sat on the flowery sward.

    <p>
    <lb/><pb n="8.418"/>When Sol shot down its rays the enemy—
    <lb/>That doer of div’s work—approached the palace,
    <lb/>And went about it, but that splendid seat
    <lb/>Was void of Shah. They gave to spoil his treasures,
    <lb/>None recking of his travail, and then all
    <lb/>Withdrew in tears and wroth at fortune’s doings.
    <lb/>What of yon swiftly turning sky say we,
    <lb/>Which never resteth from its instancy ?
    <lb/>It giveth unto one the royal crown,
    <lb/>Another to the fishes in the sea.
    <lb/>One man hath head and feet and shoulders bare,
    <lb/>No peace, no food, no shelter anywhere ;
    <lb/>It giveth to another drink of milk
    <lb/>And honey ; furs, brocade, and silks to wear !
    <lb/>Dust and the darkness of the grave await
    <lb/>Them both. To be unborn would best abate
    <lb/>The sage’s cares for never to have been
    <lb/>Is better than to be for small and great.
    <lb/>Now for fresh toil upon Khusrau Parwiz
    <lb/>To give reciters novel histories.
    <lb/>The Shah bode in that mead, a lofty tree
    <lb/>O’ershadowing him. When half the longsome day
    <lb/>Had passed he hungered. Now within the pleasance
    <lb/>There was a man employed who did not know
    <lb/>The king by sight. The Sun-faced bade his slave :—
    <lb/><q>Cut off a cantle from this costly belt.</q>
    <lb/>That cantle had on it five studs of gold
    <lb/>Enriched with jewelry. The king then spake
    <lb/>Thus to the gardener: <q>These studs will prove
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2024"/>
    <lb/>Of use to-day. Go thou to the bazar,
<pb n="8.419"/>
    <lb/>Buy meat and bread, and shun frequented paths.</q>
    <lb/>Those jewels would have cost a purchaser
    <lb/>Some thirty thousand drachms. Immediately
    <lb/>The gardener sought a baker and asked bread
    <lb/>In change for that gold cantle but the baker
    <lb/>Said: <q>I have not its worth and cannot pass it.</q>
    <lb/>The two conveyed it to a jeweller,
    <lb/>And said: <q>Price this according to thy knowledge.</q>
    <lb/>The expert, when he looked upon the studs,
    <lb/>Said: <q>Who will dare to buy, for this should be
    <lb/>Within the treasury of Khusrau Parwiz,
    <lb/>Who hath a hundred new like this each year ?
    <lb/>Whom didst thou steal these jewels from, or didst
    <lb/>Thou cut them off a slave who was asleep ?</q>
    <lb/>The three men went to Farrukhzad and took
    <lb/>The jewels, gold and all, and he on seeing
    <lb/>Ran to the new-made king and showed the gems,
    <lb/>And cantle severed from the golden girdle.
    <lb/>Shirwi said to the gardener: <q>If thou
    <lb/>Show’st not to me the owner of these jewels
    <lb/>I will behead thee and thy kith and kin
    <lb/>Forthwith.</q>
    <lb/><q>O Shah!</q> he answered, <q>in the garden
    <lb/>There is a man in armour, bow in hand,
    <lb/>In height a cypress and with cheeks like Spring,
    <lb/>In all points like a king; he brighteneth
    <lb/>The garden everywhere, and in his mail
    <lb/>Is like the shining sun. His golden shield
    <lb/>Is hanging from a bough. Before him standeth
    <lb/>A slave with loins girt up who cut for him
    <lb/>This jewelled cantle, handed it to me,
    <lb/>And told me: <q>Hence away and from the market
    <lb/>Buy bread and relish.</q> Swift as wind I left him
    <lb/>But now.</q>
    <lb/>Shirwi knew: <q>'Tis Khusrau Parwiz,
    <lb/>His features are the age’s cynosure,</q>
</p>
<pb n="8.420"/>
<p>
    <lb/>And sent three hundred horsemen from the court,
    <lb/>Like rushing wind, down to the river-bank.
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz, perceiving them afar,
    <lb/>Grew pale and drew his scimitar, but when
    <lb/>They saw the king of kings they all returned
    <lb/>In tears. They went to Farrukhzad and said :—
    <lb/><q>We are but slaves; he is Khusrau Parwiz—
    <lb/>A Shah to whom the evil day is new.
    <lb/>None either in the garden or the fray
    <lb/>Would dare breathe cold on him.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>Then Farrukhzad
    <lb/>Went to the Shah with troops from court, advanced
    <lb/>Alone and spake at large. Khusrau Parwiz
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2025"/>
    <lb/>Gave ear to him. He said: <q>If now the Shah
    <lb/>Will grant me audience, and will excuse
    <lb/>My conduct, I will come and tell the truth
    <lb/>To him but otherwise will hie me home.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>Khusrau Parwiz made answer: <q>Say thy say,
    <lb/>For thou art neither friend nor enemy.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>Then said that fluent speaker: <q>View the matter
    <lb/>More wisely and assume that thou hast slain
    <lb/>A thousand warriors, yet thou wilt get
    <lb/>Thy fill of fight at last while all Iran
    <lb/>Is hostile to thee, leagued both heart and body
    <lb/>In opposition. Wait the will of heaven:
    <lb/>Perchance these conflicts may result in love.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/><q>Yea,</q> said Khusrau Parwiz, <q>'tis well. What I
    <lb/>Dread are the vile who may approach and treat me
    <lb/>With all indignities if so they will.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>While he was speaking thus to Farrukhzad
    <lb/>His heart was troubled at his aged fortune
    <lb/>Because astrologers had said to him,
    <lb/>And he had been astonished at their words:—
    <lb/><q>Thy death will come to thee between two heights,
    <lb/>And by a slave’s hand in a lonely spot.
    <lb/>One height will be of gold and one of silver,
<pb n="8.421"/>
    <lb/>And thou with broken heart wilt sit between.
    <lb/>Thy heaven will be golden, thine earth iron,
    <lb/>And fortune will be full of enmity.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>He said: <q>So now this armour is mine earth,
    <lb/>My golden shield my heaven, and the heights
    <lb/>Are my two treasuries within the garden,
    <lb/>Which used to make my heart shine like a lamp.
    <lb/>In sooth my days are coming to an end:
    <lb/>Where is my star that used to light the world?
    <lb/>Where are the satisfaction and the peace
    <lb/>Of me who had my name inscribed on crowns?</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>They brought an elephant for him. His soul
    <lb/>Was dark with woe. He mounted, and the troops
    <lb/>Led him away while in the ancient tongue
    <lb/>He cried: <q>O treasure! if thou art my foe
    <lb/>Be not a friend to these mine enemies,
    <lb/>For I am in the hands of Ahriman
    <lb/>To-day. Thou aid’st me not in my distress:
    <lb/>Conceal thyself and show thyself to none.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>Kubad gave orders to his minister:—
    <lb/><q>Remind him not of any evil deed,
    <lb/>But bid them carry him to Taisafun
    <lb/>Away from court with his own counsellor.
    <lb/>There let him bide in peace for many a day
    <lb/>And harmed by none. Let trusty guards
    <lb/>Be made his keeper with a thousand horsemen.</q>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>When thus the sky revolved above his head
    <lb/>His reign had lasted eight and thirty years.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="2026"/>
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>It was the day of Dai of month Azar,
    <lb/>A time for fires and wine and roasted fowls,
    <lb/>When from Khusrau Parwiz the Grace of kingship
    <lb/>Withdrew and he was crownless like a slave.
    <lb/>Kubad acceded and put on the crown,
    <lb/>And sat in peace rejoicing on the throne.
</p>
<p>
    <lb/>The Iranian troops did homage to the Shah,
    <lb/>Who gave one year’s pay from the treasury,
<pb n="8.422"/>
    <lb/>And lived but seven months so call him naught,
    <lb/>Or call him Shah, just as it pleaseth thee.
    <lb/>Such is this tyrant Hostel’s wont! Thou must
    <lb/>Look not upon it with an eye of trust.
    <lb/>Of all things cultivate a generous mood,
    <lb/>And let thy thoughts be ever bent on good.
    <lb/>When thou shalt say: <q>The world hath granted me
    <lb/>My wish</q> then mark! that wish will prove to thee
    <lb/>A bond and snare. If so thou canst abstain
    <lb/>From thought of ill and list this sage’s strain,
    <lb/>Here will thy soul from every fault be freed
    <lb/>When thou dost rightly both in word and deed.
