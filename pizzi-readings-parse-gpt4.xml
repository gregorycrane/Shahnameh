### Line 7: مر او را ز دوشیدنی چارپای

- **مر** (mar) - A variant of "مرا" (mara), often used in classical Persian for "to me" or "for me," but here likely a scribal or transcription error, as it doesn't fit grammatically.

  - **Transliteration:** hezār
- **آمدندی** (āmadandī) - Likely a variant or misspelling influenced by poetic meter or dialectical variation. In standard Persian, "آمدند" (āmadand) would mean "they came," referring to past plural action. The suffix "ی" could be an archaic or poetic form to fit the verse's meter or a scribal error. Considering the context, it indicates a form of arrival or provision.
  - **Transliteration:** āmadandī
- **به** (be) - [Preposition] "To"; indicating direction towards a place or point.
  - **Transliteration:** be
- **جای** (jāy) - [Noun] "Place"; the destination or point of arrival.

This breakdown clarifies the structure and meaning of each word within the context of lines 8 and 9, highlighting the systematic approach to distributing the animals.


Continuing with the grammatical analysis for lines 10-13:

  - **Transliteration:** dāde
- **بد** (bad) - [Adjective] "Bad, ill, poor"; however, in this context, it appears to be a typographical or transliteration error. The correct word might be "به" (to) or another word fitting the context, possibly indicating a quality or attribute. Without further context, the precise meaning is challenging to discern. If considering a common typographical switch, "بد" might be intended as "به", which doesn't fit grammatically. Another possibility is interpreting "بد" as part of a phrase that has been cut off or misinterpreted.
  - **Transliteration:** bad
  ## we needed to add the vocalization "bud" that is in Pizzi to show this is a form of the verb to be.
- **پاک** (pāk) - [Adjective] "Pure, clean"; describing the "دین" (faith) in this context, indicating purity or righteousness.
  - **Transliteration:** pāk

  - **Transliteration:** dīn

**Literal translation:** To the milkmen given [was] pure faith.

**Refined translation:** He gave to the milkmen, embodying pure faith.

Given the potential error with "بد" (bad), a plausible interpretation might focus on the intent to describe an action carried out with pure faith, possibly a charitable or dutiful act towards those who milk animals. The context suggests a virtue or generosity attributed to the subject.
