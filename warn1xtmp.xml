<p>The poet, after invoking the name of God and praising Him and
His wisdom, discourses of the world, of man, of the sun and moon,
of <persName n="Mohammed"><persName n="Mohammed">the Prophet</persName></persName> and his companions, of the compilation of the
<persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName>, of the poet <persName><persName>Dakiki</persName></persName>, and of his own labours in con-

<p>§ 5. We read in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>: <q>It (the sky) looks like a
palace, that stands built of a heavenly substance, firmly estab-
lished, with ends that lie afar, shining with its body of ruby over
the three-thirds (of the earth).</q><ref target="n.1"/></p>
<p>§ 7. For <persName><persName>'Ali</persName></persName> see p. 12, Muhammadans are divided into many
sects. <persName><persName>Muhammad</persName></persName> is referred to as the lord of the sacred law,
i.e. the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Kuran</rs></rs>, of stream, milk, etc. We read there: <q>A picture
of the Paradise which is promised to the God-fearing! Therein
are rivers of water which corrupt not; and rivers of milk whose
taste changeth not ; and rivers of wine delicious to those that
quaff it ; and rivers of honey clarified: and therein are all kinds
of fruit for them, and forgiveness from their lord.</q> <ref target="n.2"/></p>
<p>§ 10. The name of <persName><persName>Firdausi</persName></persName>'s friend who procured for him the
<persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName> of Abi Mansur (see pp. 67-69) is said to have been
<persName><persName>Muhammad</persName></persName> Lashkari.<ref target="n.3"/></p>
<p>§ 11. Abi Manstr, son of <persName><persName>Muhammad</persName></persName>, may have been the son
of the <persName><persName>Muhammad</persName></persName>, son of Abdu'r-Razzak, who had the prose
Shdhnama compiled (see p. 68), if the heading can be trusted.</p>
<p>§ 12. <persName>Abu'l Kasim</persName>, i.e. <persName><persName>Firdausi</persName></persName> himself. The conquest of <placeName><placeName>Kannuj</placeName></placeName>
took place after the completion of the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName> and in days

when <persName><persName>Firdausi</persName></persName> was in exile. The mention of <placeName><placeName>Kannuj</placeName></placeName> appears
to be a flattering anticipation of events on the poet's part.<ref target="n.1"/>

<p>The <q>trusty minister</q> was no doubt Abu'l ’Abbds Fazl.</p>
<p><q>The gardens of Jram </q> were said to have been built by Shaddad,
son of Ad, that he might anticipate on earth the joys promised
him in Paradise by the prophet Hud. After toil extending over
centuries the work was completed, but as Shaddad was on the
point of entering into possession, he and all his host were slain
by a voice from heaven.<ref target="n.2"/>

<p>Nasiru'd-Din, i.e. Subuktigin (see p. 20).</p>
<p>Nast, Mahmiud's youngest brother, acted as commander-in-chief,
and governed the province of <placeName><placeName>Nishapur</placeName></placeName>. After some years of
successful administration he was recalled to court and served his
brother in various capacities. He was a patron of learning and
died young.<ref target="n.3"/>

<p><lb/>In the name of the Lord of both wisdom and mind,

<lb/>The Lord of whatever is named or assigned

<lb/>Him thou canst see not though thy sight thou strain,
<lb/>For thought itself will struggle to attain
<lb/>To One above all name and place in vain,
<lb/>Since mind and wisdom fail to penetrate
<lb/>Beyond our elements, but operate
<lb/>On matters that the senses render plain.

<lb/>None then can praise God as He is. Observe
<lb/>Thy duty: 'tis to gird thyself to serve.
<lb/>He weigheth mind and wisdom; should He be
<lb/>Encompassed by a thought that He hath weighed ?
<lb/>Can He be praised by such machinery
<lb/>As this, with mind or soul or reason's aid ?
<lb/>Confess His being but affirm no more,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="2"/>
<lb/>Adore Him and all other ways ignore,
<lb/>Observing His commands. Thy source of might
<lb/>Is knowledge; thus old hearts grow young again,
<lb/>But things above the Veil surpass in height
<lb/>All words: God's essence is beyond our ken.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>Discourse in Praise of Wisdom</head>
<p><lb/>Speak, sage! the praise of wisdom and rejoice
<lb/>The hearts of those that hearken to thy voice,
<lb/>As God's best gift to thee extol the worth
<lb/>Of wisdom, which will comfort thee and guide,
<lb/>And lead thee by the hand in heaven and earth.
<lb/>Both joy and grief, and gain and loss, betide
<lb/>Therefrom, and when it is eclipsed the sane
<lb/>Know not of happiness one moment more.
<lb/>Thus saith the wise and virtuous man of lore
<lb/>Lest sages search his words for fruit in vain :—
<lb/><q>What man soever spurneth wisdom's rede
<lb/>Will by so doing make his own heart bleed ;
<lb/>The prudent speak of him as one possessed,
<lb/>And <q>he is not of us</q> his kin protest.</q>
<lb/>In both worlds wisdom recommendeth thee
<lb/>When gyves are on the ankles of the mad;
<lb/>It is the mind's eye; if thou dost not see
<lb/>Therewith thy journey through this world is sad.
<pb n="102"/>
<lb/>It was the first created thing, and still
<lb/>Presideth o'er the mind and faculty
<lb/>Of praise—praise offered by tongue, ear, and eye,
<lb/>All causes it may be of good or ill.
<lb/>To praise both mind and wisdom who would dare?
<lb/>And if I venture, who would hear me through ?
<lb/>Since then, O man of wisdom! thou canst do 
<lb/>No good by words hereon, proceed, declare
<milestone unit="vullers" n="3"/>
<lb/>Creation's process. God created thee
<lb/>To know appearance and reality.
<lb/>Let wisdom be thy minister to fend
<lb/>Thy mind from all that self-respect should shun,
<lb/>Learn by the words of sages how to wend
<lb/>Thy way, roam earth, converse with every one;
<lb/>And when thou hearest any man of lore
<lb/>Discourse, sleep not, increase thy wisdom's store ;
<lb/>But mark, while gazing at the boughs of speech,
<lb/>How much the roots thereof are out of reach.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>Of the Making of the World</head>
<p><lb/>The first thing needful for thee is to know
<lb/>The sum of primal elements which He,
<lb/>Who maketh all things, made from naught to show
<lb/>The greatness of His own supremacy.
<lb/>Those elements are fourfold; at their birth
<lb/>No time elapsed and labour had no share;
<lb/>Fire shone above, and in the midst were air
<lb/>And water; underneath was dusky earth.
<lb/>Fire was the first its virtue to unfold ;
<lb/>About it moisture ceased and dryness came ;
<pb n="103"/>
<lb/>Then fire where'er it failed made way for cold,
<lb/>And moisture followed cold.</p>
<p><lb/>Even so the frame
<lb/>Of this our Wayside Hostelry was made.
<lb/>When these four primal elements combined,
<lb/>They wrought, each on the rest, till every kind
<lb/>Of products as we see them was displayed.
<lb/>The turning vault of heaven showed its face,
<lb/>Exhibiting new wonders day by day,
<lb/>The Seven Planets then began their sway
<lb/>In yon Twelve Houses; each one took its place,
<lb/>Foreboding good and ill, and giving fit
<lb/>Return to every one that hath the wit
<lb/>To read. The heavens, fettered sphere to sphere,
<lb/>Moved as their making to completion came,
<lb/>And then this earth, with mountain, desert, mere,
<lb/>And upland, shone as 'twere a lamp aflame.
<lb/>The mountains reared themselves, the streams gushed out,
<lb/>While from the soil the herbs began to sprout.
<lb/>Our earth was not vouchsafed a lofty stead ;
<lb/>Obscurity and gloom prevailed around,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="4"/>
<lb/>But stars displayed their wonders overhead
<lb/>And light grew more abundant on the ground ;
<lb/>Then fire arose and water sank, the sun
<lb/>About the world its course began to run.
<lb/>The herbage and the various kinds of trees
<lb/>Grew up as fortune would. No faculties
<lb/>Have they but growth. Thus fixed they were the prey
<lb/>Of all the animals that passed, while they,
<lb/>The roamers, aim at safety, nourishment,
<lb/>And rest ; with such a life they are content.
<lb/>With sluggish wits and tongues that never spake,
<lb/>They browse upon the briar and the brake,
<pb n="104"/>
<lb/>Acknowledging no end as wrong or right
<lb/>And not required to offer reverence
<lb/>To Him who, having wisdom, justice, might,
<lb/>Hath not withheld one single excellence.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>Of the Nature of Man</head>
<p><lb/>A farther step—man cometh into sight ;
<lb/>Locks had been made; he was the key of each.
<lb/>With head erect and cypresslike in height,
<lb/>Submiss to wisdom and endowed with speech,
<lb/>Possessed of knowledge, wisdom, reasoning,
<lb/>He ruleth other creatures as their king.
<lb/>Observe awhile with wisdom for thy guide:
<lb/>Doth <q>man</q> imply one nature, one alone ?
<lb/>Thou know'st it may be but the feeble side
<lb/>Of mortal man, wherein no trace is shown
<lb/>Of aught beyond, and yet two worlds agree—
<lb/>A mighty partnership—to furnish thee.
<lb/>By nature first, in order last, art thou ;
<lb/>Hold not thyself then lightly. I have known
<lb/>Shrewd men speak otherwise, but who shall trow
<lb/>The secrets that pertain to God alone ?
<lb/>Look to the end, act ever rightfully
<lb/>And toil, since sloth and knowledge ne'er agree ;
<lb/>But if thou wouldst escape calamity,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="5"/>
<lb/>In both worlds from the net of bale be freed
<lb/>And in God's sight a righteous man indeed,
<lb/>Then to yon swiftly turning dome thy gaze
<lb/>Direct, that cause of anguish and relief,
<lb/>A dome not fretted by the lapse of days
<lb/>And unaffected by our joy or grief;
<pb n="105"/>
<lb/>It stayeth not to rest but turneth still,
<lb/>Not perishing like us but undecayed :
<lb/>There both the term and process are displayed,
<lb/>There are revealed to thee both good and ill.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>Of the Nature of the Sun</head>
<p><lb/>Of ruby is yon azure dome, not made
<lb/>Of air and water, dust and smoke; 'tis all
<lb/>With lamp and torch in many a spot arrayed
<lb/>Like gardens for the New Year's festival.
<lb/>Within the dome a gladdening Gem behold
<lb/>Revolving; thence the light of day is spread,
<lb/>And every morning like a shield of gold
<lb/>It raiseth from the East its shining head ;
<lb/>The earth is clad in robes of spreading light,
<lb/>The sun declineth and there cometh night ;
<lb/>Day ne'er o'ertaketh night, nor night the day,
<lb/>Most regular in all their movements they.
<lb/>O thou my Sun! hast thou for me no ray ?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>Of the Nature of the Moon</head>
<p><lb/>Though night be dark there is a light assured:

<p><lb/>Two days and nights its features are obscured,

<lb/>'Tis seen again but pallid, thin, and backed,
<lb/>Like one who by the pangs of love is racked.

<lb/>In fourteen days it waxeth full and bright,
<lb/>In fourteen waneth till its course is run,
<lb/>Diminishing as night succeedeth night
<lb/>And drawing nearer to the blazing sun.
<lb/>Such was the nature given by God's decree
<lb/>And will be, while the moon itself shall be.</p></div>

<lb/>As beauteous as the eye of chanticleer.
<lb/><persName><persName>Muhammad</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>'Ali</persName></persName> are there within

<lb/>A certain paladin, of rustic birth,
<lb/>A man of courage, wisdom, rank, and worth,
<lb/>An antiquary, one who ransacked earth
<lb/>For any legends of the ages past,

<p><lb/>Now, when the readers of the book had brought

<milestone unit="vullers" n="9"/>
<lb/>A brilliant youth well skilled in poetry 
<lb/>Arose, of ardent mind and eloquent ;
<lb/><q>I will retell these tales in verse,</q> said he,
<lb/>And every one rejoiced at his intent ;
<lb/>But vicious habits were his friends, though we
<lb/>Should hold all vices foes that we should dread,
<lb/>And death, approaching unexpectedly,
<lb/>Imposed its gloomy helmet on his head.
<lb/>He gave his life to vice, and earth ne'er gave
<lb/>Him true enjoyment for a single day
<lb/>While fortune quickly turned its face away:
<lb/>He perished by the hand of his own slave.
<lb/>Departing thus he left those tales of yore
<lb/>Untold; their wakened fortune slept once more.
<lb/>O God! forgive his faults, and in Thy grace
<lb/>Assign him at the last an honoured place.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><head>How the present Book was begun</head>
<p><lb/>Mine ardent heart tutned, when <persName><persName>Dakiki</persName></persName> fell,
<lb/>Spontaneously toward the franian throne;
<lb/><q>If I can get the book I will retell,</q>
<lb/>I said, <q>the tales in language of mine own.</q>
<pb n="110"/>
<lb/>I asked of persons more than I can say,
<lb/>For I was fearful.as time passed away
<lb/>That life would not suffice, but that I too
<lb/>Should leave the work for other hands to do.
<lb/>There was besides a dearth of patronage
<lb/>For such a work; there was no purchaser.
<lb/>It was a time of war, a straitened age
<lb/>For those who had petitions to prefer.
<lb/>Much time elapsed. I still concealed from all
<lb/>My secret purpose, for I could not see
<lb/>One who was worthy to partake with me
<lb/>This enterprise. What in this world can be
<lb/>More excellent than noble words? Men call
<lb/>Down blessings on them, men both great and small,
<lb/>Good words had God vouchsafed not to provide,
<lb/>How had <persName n="Mohammed"><persName n="Mohammed">the Prophet</persName></persName> ever been our guide ?
<milestone unit="vullers" n="10"/>
<lb/>I had a dear friend in the city, thou
<lb/>Hadst said: <q>They twain have but one skin.</q> One day
<lb/>He said: <q>I like thy scheme; pursue thy way;
<lb/>Thy feet are in the right direction now.
<lb/>I undertake for my part to procure
<lb/>This ancient <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs></rs> book; but be not slack.
<lb/>Of youth and eloquence thou hast a store,
<lb/>Thy speech possesseth too the ancient smack.

<lb/>And raise thy reputation with the great.</q>
<lb/>He brought the volume to me and anon
<lb/>The darkness of my gloomy soul was gone.</p>

<p><lb/>When I obtained the volume a grandee
<lb/>Of noble lineage and conspicuous worth,
<lb/>Still in his youth, a paladin by birth,
<pb n="111"/>
<lb/>Possessing prudence, wit, and energy, 
<lb/>A lord of counsel and of modesty,
<lb/>To hear whose gentle accents was my joy,
<lb/>Said unto me: <q>What means can I employ
<lb/>To make thee give thy life to poetry ?
<lb/>I will do all and hide thy poverty.</q>
<lb/>He used to tender me as one would tend
<lb/>Ripe apples, lest a breath of wind should spoil;
<lb/>Thus through that noble and kind-hearted friend
<lb/>I soared to <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs></rs> from our grimy soil.
<lb/>In his eyes gold and silver were as dust
<lb/>While rank gained lustre. Earth seemed vile indeed
<lb/>Before him. He was brave and one to trust,
<lb/>And when he perished was as in a mead
<lb/>A lofty cypress levelled by a gust.
<lb/>I see no trace of him alive or dead;
<lb/>By murderous Crocodiles his life was sped.
<lb/>Woe for that girdle and that girdlestead,
<lb/>That royal mien, that high imperial head !
<lb/>Bereft of him my heart's hopes ceased to be,
<lb/>My spirit quivered like a willow-tree ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="11"/>
<lb/>But I bethink me, to redress this woe, 
<lb/>Of counsel which to that great prince I owe;
<lb/>He said: <q>This Tale of Kings, if 'tis thy fate
<lb/>To tell it, to the great king dedicate.</q>
<lb/>Those words gave solace to my heart; there came
<lb/>Thereto a sense of gladness and content ;
<lb/>I took in hand my story in the name
<lb/>Of him who is o'er kings pre-eminent,
<lb/>The lord of earth, the lord of crown and throne,
<lb/>Whose conquering fortune sleep hath never known.

<lb/>By thoughts of this great monarch occupied
<lb/>I fell asleep one night with lips all praise,

<lb/>Shone in the dark. Then I beheld in sleep
<lb/>A dazzling lustre rising from the deep
<lb/>And making by the brightness of its rays
<lb/>The gloom of earth like glittering gems. The waste
<lb/>Grew like brocade beneath that radiant light,
<lb/>And in the midst a turquoise throne was placed.
<lb/>Upon the throne there sat a moon-like king
<lb/>With on his head a crown for covering.
<lb/>His army stretched two miles. To left there were
<lb/>Seven hundred elephants in all their might.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="12"/>
<lb/>Before him stood a trusty minister

<lb/>By that <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>'s <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>, by all those troops outspread
<lb/>And mighty elephants my head was dazed,
<lb/>And as upon his royal face I gazed

<lb/>Are these his soldiers or the stars come down ?</q>
<lb/>One answered: <q>'Tis the king of <placeName><placeName>Rum</placeName></placeName> and <placeName><placeName>Ind</placeName></placeName>,

<lb/>Do thou too tell his praise, for thou canst speak,

<lb/>When I awakened to my feet I sprang,
<lb/>Oh! what a while that night his praise I sang!
<lb/>No drachms had I but poured my soul, and eried
<lb/>To mine own heart: <q>My dream is justified,
<lb/>For his renown is patent far and wide.</q>

<pb n="116"/>
<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>
<p><lb/>The poet tells the history of the first ten <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shahs</rs></rs> of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>, describes the progress of the world from barbarism to culture, and the invention of the arts and sciences, and finally how the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> departed from the Pishdadian Dynasty through the unworthiness and degeneracy of its representatives.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p>The word Pishdadian, the name given to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shahs</rs></rs> of the first
<rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> Dynasty, means those of the old law or original dispensation. Zoroastrianism was built upon an older foundation of nature-worship, to which it bears some such relation as the New
Testament bears to the Old. One of the gods of the elder faith-—
Ahura, the Asura of India—became the supreme deity, Ahura
Mazda, of the new dispensation, and the <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> of the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName>.
Accordingly <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName>, the first <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> in the poem, is expressly recognised in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>, as the first worshipper of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs>.<ref target="n.1"/>
<persName><persName>Hushang</persName></persName>, the second <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, institutes the worship of fire—a characteristic feature of Zoroastrianism. <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> makes a covenant with <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName>, the fourth <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, and tries to persuade him to undertake the part of lawgiver afterwards taken by <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName>, but <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> through modesty declines.</p>
<p>Zoroastrianism therefore in a sense existed before <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName>, with whose advent the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> ends; hence there is less anachronism than might be supposed in the allusions, often made in the earlier parts of the poem, to fire-worship, the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>, and similar matters. <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName> was the first recipient of the complete revelation.

</div>
<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p>The poet in his account of <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName> omits much <rs type="religion"><rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs></rs> lore. In the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs> <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> is represented as first creating two beings—the representatives of mankind, and of the animals and plants, respectively. These were <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName> and the Primeval Ox. For three thousand years they lived happily and unmolested in the world of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs>. At the expiration of this period
<rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> assailed the creation of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs>, and slew both the Ox and <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName>; but the latter survived the former by thirty years, which became the duration of the reign of the first <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> in the poem. The Ox in dying gave origin to the plants and animals, and <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName> to the first human couple—Mashya' and Maéshyoi— who in turn produced offspring among which was <persName><persName>Siyamak</persName></persName>, who is represented as the son of <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName> in the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName>. In the poem, too, the attack on <persName><persName>Gaiumart</persName></persName> is made indirectly by means of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">the Black Div</rs></rs>, not directly by <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> as in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs>.
The reader may be reminded that the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs> is a <rs type="language"><rs type="language">Pahlavi</rs></rs> version of the lost book of the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> known as the Damdad or <q>races produced.</q></p>

<lb/>Who listened eagerly ; his heart seethed up

<p><lb/>He civilised the world,
<lb/>And filled the surface of the earth with justice.
<lb/>He was the first to deal with minerals
<lb/>And win the iron from the rock by craft.
<lb/>He gained more knowledge and, inventing smithing,
<lb/>Made axes, saws, and mattocks. Next he turned
<lb/>To irrigation by canals and ducts ;
<lb/><rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> made the labour short. As knowledge grew
<lb/>Men sowed and reaped and planted. Each produced

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How the Feast of Sada was Founded</head>

<lb/>With eyes like pools of blood and jaws whose smoke

<lb/>Came from its stony hiding-place again
<lb/>When iron knocked. The worldlord offered praise
<lb/>For such a radiant gift. He made of fire

<p><lb/>That night he made a mighty blaze, he stood

<p><persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>, as we have already seen, is the brother, not the son, of <persName><persName>Tahmuras</persName></persName> in the older form of the legends.

Vivasvat, the bright or shining one, i.e. the sun. <persName><persName>Manu</persName></persName> is the progenitor and lawgiver of the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Aryan</rs></rs> race and Yama is a god!
In the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> is the son of Vivanghat, is the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs>
Noah, has a covenant with God, and is offered by Him the post afterwards accepted by <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName>. In the legend of the building
<note n="1">DHA, iv. 31.</note>
<pb n="130"/> 
of his Var, or underground palace, in anticipation of the Flood, we have the origin of <persName><persName>Firdausi</persName></persName>'s account of the architectural achievements of <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>: <quote>Then <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> said within himself: <q>How shall
I manage to make that Vara which Ahura Mazda has commanded me to make?</q> And Ahura Mazda said unto <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName>: <q>O fair
<placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName>, son of Vivanghat! Crush the earth with a stamp of thy heel, and then knead it with thy hands, as the potter does when kneading the potter's clay...</q> And <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> made a Vara, long as a riding-ground, on every side of the square... . There he established dwelling-places, consisting of a house with a balcony, a courtyard, and a gallery. In the largest part of the place he made nine streets, six in the middle part, three in the smallest.</quote> <ref target="n.1"/>
He is described as <q>the bright <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName>, the good shepherd... he ruled over the seven Karshvares (Climes) of the earth, over the Daévas (demons) and men. . . . He who took from the Daévas both riches and welfare, both fatness and flocks, both weal and
<rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Glory</rs></rs>. In whose reign ‘both aliments (food and drink) were never failing for feeding creatures, flocks and men were undying, waters and plants were undrying; in whose reign there was neither cold wind nor hot wind, neither old age nor death, nor envy made by the Daévas, in the times before his lie, before he began to have delight in words of falsehood and untruth. But when he began to have delight in words of falsehood and untruth, the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Glory</rs></rs> was seen to flee away from him in the shape of a bird.
When his <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Glory</rs></rs> had disappeared, then the great <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> ... the good shepherd, trembled and was in sorrow before his foes; he was confounded, and laid him down on the ground.</q><ref target="n.2"/> Elsewhere his being sawn asunder is mentioned, the act not being referred directly to Zahhaék but to Spityura, <q>he who sawed <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> in twain.</q> <ref target="n.3"/>
Spityura was a brother of <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName>'s. He is not mentioned in the
<persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName>; but the enmity between brothers, so characteristic of
Eastern life, crops up again and again in the poem. Thus the two brothers of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> envy and try to murder him, and the incident recurs with more disastrous results in the case of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>'s own sons.</p>
<p>The division into castes also appears in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>, where both the three and the four castes are mentioned, and the first three are there stated to have been instituted by <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName>, who placed his three earthly sons at the head of them.<ref target="n.4"/> In the poem they are the institution of his great predecessor <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>.
<persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName> is a contraction of <placeName><placeName>Yima</placeName></placeName> and Khshaé¢ta (king).<ref target="n.5"/>

<p><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> will be dealt with under his proper head; but it may be pointed out with regard to the strange story of his second fall, owing to the pleasures of the table, that in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs> Mashya and Miishyéi—the original human pair—who apparently at first lived entirely on water, are incited to partake of stronger meats owing to their relish for the weaker sorts being taken from them by the demons.<ref target="n.1"/>
Elsewhere in the same work we read: <q>On the nature of the resurrection and future existence it says in revelation, that, whereas Mashya and Mashyéi . . . first fed upon water, then plants, then milk, and then meat, men also when their time of death has come, first desist from eating meat, then milk, then from bread, till when they shall die they always feed upon water.
So, likewise, in the millennium. ... They will desist from meat food, and eat vegetables and milk; afterwards they abstain from milk food and abstain from vegetable food, and are feeding on water; and for ten years before Sdédshyans comes they remain without food, and do not die.</q><ref target="n.2"/>
Sdéshyans is the third of the divine sons of <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName>, and the
Messiah of Zoroastrianism. There is plenty in the above extract to account for such a legend as that of the text.</p>

<p><lb/>He first wrought arms and oped for warriors
<lb/>The door of fame. His <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> made iron yield ;
<lb/>He fashioned it to helmets, hauberks, breastplates,
<lb/>Ad coats of armour both for man and horse.</p>
<p><lb/>His ardent mind achieved the work and made
<lb/>Good store in fifty years. Another fifty
<lb/>He spent on raiment fit for fight or feast ;
<lb/>And made of spun and floss silk, hair and cotton,
<lb/>Fine fabrics, cloth of hair and rich brocade.
<lb/>He taught to spin and weave, and when the stufis
<lb/>Were made he showed men how to full and sew them
<lb/>Then to the joy of all he founded castes
<milestone unit="vullers" n="24"/>
<lb/>For every craft; it took him fifty years.
<lb/>Distinguishing one caste as sacerdotal
<lb/>To be employed in sacred offices,
<lb/>He separated it from other folk
<lb/>And made its place of service on the mountains
<lb/>That God might be adored in quietude.
<lb/>Arrayed for battle on the other hand
<lb/>Were those who formed the military caste ;
<lb/>They were the lion-men inured to war—
<lb/>The Lights of armies and of provinces—
<lb/>Whose office was to guard the royal throne
<lb/>And vindicate the nation's name for valour.
<lb/>The third caste was the agricultural,
<lb/>All independent tillers of the soil,
<lb/>The sowers and the reapers—men whom none
<lb/>Upbraideth when they eat. Though clothed in rags,
<lb/>The wearers are not slaves, and sounds of chiding
<lb/>Reach not their ears. They are free men and labour
<lb/>Upon the soil safe from dispute and contest.
<lb/>What said the noble man and eloquent ?
<lb/><q><lb/>'Tis idleness that maketh freemen slaves.</q>
<lb/>The fourth caste was the artizans. They live
<lb/>By doing handiwork—a turbulent crew,
<pb n="133"/>
<lb/>Who being always busied with their craft
<lb/>Are given much to thought. <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName> thus spent
<lb/>Another fifty years and did much good,
<lb/>For each man learnt his place and others' too.
<lb/>He bade the foul divs temper earth with water
<lb/>And taught them how to fashion moulds for bricks.
<lb/>They laid foundations first with stones and lime,
<lb/>Then raised thereon by rules of art such structures
<milestone unit="vullers" n="25"/>
<lb/>As hot baths, lofty halls, and sanctuaries.
<lb/>He searched among the rocks for stones whose lustre
<lb/>Attracted him and came on many a jewel,
<lb/>As rubies, amber, silver, gold. <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>
<lb/>Unlocked their doors and brought them forth by spells.
<lb/>He introduced the scents that men enjoy
<lb/>As cainphor, genuine musk, gum Benjamin,
<lb/>Sweet aloe, ambergris, and bright rosewater.
<lb/>Next leechcrait and the healing of the sick,
<lb/>The means of health, the course of maladies
<lb/>Were secrets opened by <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>: the world
<lb/>Hath seen no other such discoverer.
<lb/>He crossed the sea in ships. For fifty years
<lb/>His wisdom brought to light the properties
<lb/>Of things. These works achieved, <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName> ambitioned
<lb/>Rank loftier still, and by his royal <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>
<lb/>Made him a throne, with what a wealth of gems

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>The Story of Zahhadk and his Father</head>
<p><lb/>One of the desert spear-armed Bedouins
<milestone unit="vullers" n="28"/>
<lb/>Of noble birth then lived a virtuous king,
<lb/>Just, highborn, generous, and hight Mardas,
<lb/>Who sought his God with reverence and sighs,
<lb/>He kept a thousand head of all milch cattle,
<lb/>Goats, camels, sheep, and kine—a gentle breed—
<lb/>With <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> steeds, all timid beauties they,
<lb/>And grudged the milk to none. He had a son
<lb/>Whom much he loved—<persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, a gallant prince,
<lb/>But hasty. People called him Biwarasp.
<lb/>Ten thousand is <q>biwar</q> in ancient <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs></rs>,
<lb/>And he possessed ten thousand <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> steeds
<lb/>With golden equipage—a famous stud.
<lb/>Most of his days and nights he spent on horseback
<pb n="136"/>
<lb/>Engaged in superintendence not in war.</p>
<p><lb/>One day <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> approached him as a friend
<lb/>And led his wits astray. The youth gave ear
<lb/>With pleasure and all unsuspectingly
<lb/>Gave to <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> heart, reason, and pure soul,
<lb/>And heaped the dust on his own head. <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs>
<lb/>Exulted seeing that the youth was snared
<lb/>And gulled the simpleton with specious words,
<lb/>Thus saying: <q>I could tell thee many things
<lb/>Known to myself alone.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The youth made answer :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="29"/>
<lb/><q>Tell me at once, my worthy monitor !</q></p>
<p><lb/><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> replied: <q>First promise, then my story.</q>
<lb/>The guileless youth swore as <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> dictated :—
<lb/><q>Thy secret shall be kept, thy bidding done.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then said <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs>: <q>Great prince! shall any rule
<lb/>Here but thyself? What profiteth a sire
<lb/>With such a son? Now hearken to my rede:
<lb/>The lifetime of this ancient potentate
<lb/>Continueth, thou art shelved. Seize on his court
<lb/>And goods. His place will suit thee, thou shalt be
<lb/>King of the world if thou durst do my bidding.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> looked grave ; to shed his sire's blood grieved him.
<lb/>He said: <q>Not so, suggest some other course:
<lb/>This cannot be.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Then thou,</q> <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> rejoined,
<lb/><q>Art perjured and wilt still be despicable,
<lb/>Thy father honoured.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus he snared the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Who asked: <q>What must I do? I will obey.</q></p>
<p><lb/><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> replied: <q>Leave me to scheme. Thy head
<lb/>Shall touch the sun. I only ask thy silence;
<lb/>No help need I, myself am competent,
<lb/>But keep the sword of speech within the scabbard.</q></p>
<pb n="137"/>
<p><lb/>Now in the palace was a jocund garth,
<lb/>And thither used Mardas to go at dawn
<lb/>To bathe him ere he prayed, without a slave
<lb/>To light him on his way. The wicked <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Div</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Intent on ill, dug in the garden-path
<milestone unit="vullers" n="30"/>
<lb/>A deep pit, masked and made it good with boughs.
<lb/>Ere dawn the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> chieftain hied him thither
<lb/>And, as he reached the pit, his fortunes fell;
<lb/>That good man tumbled, broke his back, and died.
<lb/>He ne'er had breathed a cold breath on his son,
<lb/>But cherished him and lavished treasure on him,
<lb/>Yet that abandoned youth respected not
<lb/>His father, but conspired to shed his blood.</p>
<p><lb/>I heard a sage once say: <q>Though fierce in strife
<lb/>No son will dare to take his father's life ;
<lb/>If such a crime should seem to be implied,
<lb/>Seek for the reason on the mother's side.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Vile and unjust <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> thus seized the throne,

<lb/>For good or ill.</p>
<p><lb/><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> encouraged thus

<lb/>Thy word once more to do as I require;
<lb/>And then thy realm shall spread throughout the world,
<lb/>Birds, beasts, and fishes shall be all thine own.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When this was said he set about to use,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> turned Cook</head>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="31"/>
<p><lb/>Then as a youth well spoken, clean, and clever,
<lb/><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> went to <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> with fawning words,
<pb n="138"/>
<lb/><q>Let me,</q> he said, <q>who am a noted cook,
<lb/>Find favour with the king.</q></p>
<p><lb/>By appetite
<lb/>Seduced, <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> received and welcomed him,
<lb/>So that the monarch's faithful minister
<lb/>Gave to <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> the royal kitchen's key.
<lb/>Foods then were few, men did not kill to eat
<lb/>But lived on vegetals of all earth's produce;
<lb/>So evil-doing <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> designed
<lb/>To slaughter animals for food, and served
<lb/>Both bird and beast. He fed the king on blood
<lb/>To make him lion-fierce, and like a slave
<lb/>Obeyed him. First he fed his lord on yelk
<lb/>To make him strong; he liked the flavour much
<lb/>And praised <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs>, who said: <q>Illustrious monarch!
<lb/>For ever live! To-morrow I will serve thee
<lb/>So as to please thee well.</q></p>
<p><lb/>All night he mused
<lb/>What strange repast to proffer on the morrow,
<lb/>And when the azure vault brought back again
<lb/>The golden Gem he hopefully presented
<lb/>A meal of partridges and silver pheasants.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="32"/>
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> monarch ate and his small wits
<lb/>Were lost in admiration. On the third day
<lb/><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> served lamb and fowl, and on the fourth
<lb/>A chine of veal with saffron and rosewater,
<lb/>Musk and old wine. <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> when he had tasted,
<lb/>In wonder at his cook's ability,
<lb/>Said: <q>Worthy friend! ask thou my recompense.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered: <q>Live, O king! in wealth and power.
<lb/>My heart is thine, thy favour my soul's food ;
<lb/>Yet would I ask one boon above my station:
<lb/>'Tis leave to kiss and lay my face and eyes
<lb/>Upon thy shoulders.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Off his guard <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>
<lb/>Replied: <q>I grant it; it may do thee grace.</q></p>
<pb n="139"/>
<p><lb/><rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> received permission, kissed and vanished.
<lb/>A marvel followed—from the monarch's shoulders
<lb/>Grew two black snakes. Distraught he sought a cure
<lb/>And in the end excised them, but they grew
<lb/>Again! oh strange! like branches from a tree.
<lb/>The ablest leeches gave advice in turn
<lb/>And used their curious arts but all in vain.
<lb/>At length <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Iblis</rs></rs> himself came hurrying
<lb/>Dight asa leech. <q>This was thy destiny,</q>
<lb/>He said; <q>cut not the snakes but let them live.

<lb/>Give them men's brains and gorge them till they sleep.
<lb/>It is the only means, such food may kill them.</q></p>

<lb/>Pretenders started up, on every march

<lb/>For they had heard: <q>There is a monarch there—

<lb/>Thus all the discontented cavaliers
<lb/>Went to <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> and offered fealty,
<lb/>Saluting him as monarch of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>The king of dragon-visage came like wind

<lb/>And having seized the throne of <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>
<lb/>Slipped on the world as 'twere a finger-ring.
<lb/>Thus fell <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>. Pressed by the world's new lord
<lb/>He fled, surrendering crown, throne and treasure,
<lb/>Host, power and diadem. The world turned black
<milestone unit="vullers" n="34"/>
<lb/>To him, he disappeared and yielded all.

<lb/>But in the hundredth year the impious <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>Appeared one day beside the sea of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> clutched him forthwith, gave him small respite,
<lb/>And sawing him asunder freed the world
<lb/>From him and from the fear that he inspired.
<lb/>Long was he hidden from the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s breath,
<lb/>But there was no escaping in the end,
<lb/>For fortune whirled him like a yellow straw

<lb/>And yet what profit could he call his own

<p><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>,as we have already seen,<ref target="n.1"/> was originally an evil spirit of the Indo-Iranian nature-worship. In the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> he still occasionally appears in his character of water-stealer. <quote><q>Zarathustra asked Ardvi Sura Andhita</q></quote> (Anaitis, the good genius of the waters): <quote><q>O Ardvi Sura Anahita!

<p>More generally, however, he is represented as a fiend, created by <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> to vex the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> race, and carry off the light of sovereignty ; while in the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName> he loses to a great extent his supernatural character, and is, as already has been pointed out,<ref target="n.3"/> the protagonist of the Semitic race in their dealings with the

people of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>. He is accordingly represented as a native of
<placeName><placeName>Arabia</placeName></placeName>, to have invaded <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>, and to have had his capital at a city which is perhaps best identified with <placeName><placeName>Babylon</placeName></placeName>. We read in the

He begged of her a boon, saying: <q>Grant me this boon, O good, most beneficent Ardvi Sura Anahita! that I may make all the seven Karshvares (Climes) of the earth empty ofmen.</q> Ardvi Sura
Andhita did not grant him that boon. ... . To her did <persName><persName>Thraetaona</persName></persName>
(<persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>), the heir of the valiant Athwya clan, offer up a sacrifice
.... saying: <q>Grant me this, O good, most beneficent Ardvi Sura

<p><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>'s palace is called in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> Kvirinta, which may mean in the Avasta language <q>a stork.</q> There is a legend that the palace was in the form of that bird.<ref target="n.2"/></p>
<p>We learn from the Dinkard that the legend of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> was contained in the Kitradad and Sudkar Nasks of the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>.
The latter Nask contained information <q>About the smiting by
Frédun, for the sake of killing <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs>; the striking of his club upon the nape of the neck, the heart, and even the skull; and
<rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs>'s not dying from that beating. Then smiting him with a sword, and the formation of noxious creatures of many kinds, from the body of <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs>, at the first, second, and third blow.
The exclamation of the creator Auharmazd to Frédtin thus: ‘Thou shouldst not cut him who is <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs>, because if thou shouldst cut him, <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs> would be making this earth full of serpents, toads, scorpions, lizards, tortoises, and frogs ;’ with the mode of binding him with awful fetters, in the most grievous punishment of confinement. This, too, that when Az-i <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs> was bound, the report of the same proceeded thus through all the regions, which are seven, that downstricken is Az-i <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs>, but he who smote him is Frédin the Aspikdn, the exalted and mighty ... and those which are evil do not mention Az, nor demand the virtuous maiden with importunity, nor even coveted wealth. This, too, that when information came to him of women or property, that

<p><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> is looked upon in the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName> as exemplifying in his own person all the chief characteristics of the non-<rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Aryan</rs></rs> peoples with whom the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></rs> came in contact—idolatry, black arts, serpent-worship, and human sacrifice. It is a remarkable fact, as is pointed out by Fergusson,<ref target="n.1"/> that serpent-worship seems always to have been accompanied by human sacrifice. He also appears to consider that the former was essentially <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turanian</rs></rs>, not <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Aryan</rs></rs> or Semitic, and he points out that in the bas-relief at Nakhs-i-
<persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, in which <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> is represented as bestowing the crown on Ardshir Papakan, the first <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> of the Sasanian dynasty, the god is seated on a horse, and beneath his feet lies Ardawan, the last king of the Parthian dynasty, with two serpents round his head.<ref target="n.2"/></p>
<p>In the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName>, however, <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> is essentially Semitic, and his reign of a thousand years may be taken as typifying that race in their relations to the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></rs> from the earliest traditions of Assyrian oppression to the political overlordship of the
Khalifas of Baghdad in the poet's own days.</p>
<p>The reader will notice that <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> is not slain by <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> but imprisoned—a point indicative of his supernatural character; and also that the legend of <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName> the smith is, as one would naturally expect, a West <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> tradition, as shown by its association with the city of <placeName><placeName>Ispahan</placeName></placeName>. The historical flag of the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs></rs> empire, known as the flag of <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName>, the traditional origin of which will be found in the text, fell into the hands of the Muhammadans at the battle of Kadisiyya, a.d. 637.

<p>Some readers may like to see the version of the legend of

<pb n="145"/> to the point where it is taken up in the <persName><rs type="title"><persName><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs></persName></rs></persName> may be briefly summarised as follows. He was the head of a family of <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs></rs> landowners or thanes who dwelt in the <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName> range to the south of the <placeName><placeName>Caspian</placeName></placeName> and claimed to be descended from <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>.
He began the war of independence against <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, but after some success was forced to take refuge with the remnant of his adherents at the court of the king of Ghilan, who received him kindly, but, fearing the vengeance of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, subsequently furnished him with ships and provisions, and dismissed him to seek his fortune elsewhere. After a month's voyage on the
<placeName><placeName>Caspian</placeName></placeName> <persName><persName>Abtin</persName></persName> arrived at the court of the king of the Scythians, whose daughter <persName><persName>Faranak</persName></persName> fell in love with him. Incidents similar to those in the story of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> in the present volume followed. In the end <persName><persName>Abtin</persName></persName> married Fardnak, by whom he had two sons, and lived happily and in high favour with his fatherin-law. He could not rest, however. In dream after dream he was incited to resume the war of independence against Zahhdak, and at length, in spite of the opposition of his father-in-law, set sail with wife, family, and adherents, and after various adventures landed near <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName> in Mézandardn, where he made his home in the surrounding forests. Here he gathered a band of followers and resumed his guerilla warfare against <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, in the midst of which <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> was born, the birth being heralded by many prodigies. At this point the Shahndma takes up the story.<ref target="n.1"/>

<p><lb/><milestone unit="vullers" n="35"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> sat on the throne a thousand years
<lb/>Obeyed by all the world. Through that long time
<lb/>The customs of the wise were out of vogue,
<lb/>The lusts of madmen flourished everywhere,
<lb/>All virtue was despised, black art esteemed,
<lb/>Right lost to sight, disaster manifest ;
<lb/>While divs accomplished their fell purposes
<lb/>And no man spake of good unless by stealth. 
<note n="1">The above is summarised from GHP, i. 171, 211, etc.</note>
<pb n="146"/>
<lb/>Two sisters of <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>, their sex's crown,
<lb/>Were brought out trembling like a willow-leaf.
<lb/>Of those two ladies visaged ike the moon
<lb/>The names were <persName><persName>Shahrinaz</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Arnawaz</persName></persName>.
<lb/>Men bore them to the palace of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>
<lb/>And gave them over to the dragon king,
<lb/>Who educated them in evil ways
<lb/>And taught them sorcery and necromancy.
<lb/>The only teaching that he knew was bad—
<lb/>To massacre, to pillage, and to burn.</p>
<p><lb/>Each night two youths of high or lowly birth
<lb/>Were taken to the palace by the cook,
<lb/>Who having slaughtered them took out their brains
<lb/>To feed the snakes and ease the monarch's anguish.
<lb/>Now in the realm were two good high-born <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persians</rs></rs>—
<lb/>The pious Irma'il and Karmd'il
<lb/>The prescient. Talking of the lawless <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Of his retainers and those hideous meals,
<lb/>One said: <q>By cookery we might approach
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, and by our wits devise a scheme
<milestone unit="vullers" n="36"/>
<lb/>To rescue one from each pair doomed to death.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They went and learned that art. The clever twain
<lb/>Became the monarch's cooks and joyed in secret.
<lb/>The time for shedding blood and taking life
<lb/>Came, and some murderous minions of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>Dragged to the cooks with violence two youths.
<lb/>And flung them prone. The livers of the cooks
<lb/>Ached, their eyes filled with blood, their hearts with wrath,
<lb/>And each glanced at the other as he thought
<lb/>Of such an outrage by the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>. They slew
<lb/>One of the youths and thought it best to mingle
<lb/>His precious brains with sheep's and spare the other,
<lb/>To whom they said: <q>Make shift to hide thyself,
<lb/>Approach not any dwelling-place of man,
<lb/>Thine are the wastes and heights.</q></p>
<pb n="147"/>
<p><lb/>A worthless head
<lb/>Thus fed the serpents, and in every month
<lb/>The cooks preserved from slaughter thirty youths,
<lb/>And when the number reached two hundred saved
<lb/>Provided them, the donors all unknown,
<lb/>With sheep and goats, and sent them desertward.
<lb/>Thus sprang the Kurds, who know no settled home,
<lb/>But dwell in woollen tents and fear not God.</p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> was wont, such was his evil nature,
<lb/>To choose him one among his warriors
<lb/>And slay him for conspiring with the divs.
<lb/>Moreover, all the lovely noble maidens
<lb/>Secluded in their bowers, not tanged of tongues,

<lb/>And saw a vision of three warriors—

<p><lb/>He told them every whit, then said the Fair :-—

<lb/>Thy throne's seat is the signet of the age,

<lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> brought archimages shrewd of heart
<lb/>And told to them the dream that pierced his liver.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="39"/>
<lb/>He said: <q>Expound this dream without delay,
<lb/>And make my soul a pathway toward the light.</q>
<lb/>He asked them privily about the future,
<lb/>Demanding: <q>What will be my latter end,
<lb/>And who succeed me? Tell or hide your heads
<lb/>In shame.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They talked together sad at heart,
<lb/>With parched lips and with sallow countenances:
<lb/>They said: <q>If we tell truly what is fated
<lb/>We shall be tortured, haply lose our lives;
<lb/>And if we do not act straightforwardly
<lb/>As well wash hands of life.</q></p>
<p><lb/>None dared to speak :

<lb/>Upon the fourth the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> was wroth, exclaiming :—
<lb/><q>Foretell the future or be hung alive.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They drooped their heads, their hearts were rent, their eyes
<lb/>Wept tears of blood. Among them was a man,
<lb/>Wise, honest, prescient, by name Zirak— ae
<lb/>The chief of all the band of archimages.
<lb/>Concerned but fearless he addressed <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>Indulge no vapouring for none is born
<lb/>Except to die. There have been kings ere thee
<lb/>Fit for the throne of power. Both griefs and joys
<lb/>Enough they reckoned up yet their time came.
<lb/>If thou wert standing there— an iron wall—
<lb/>Yon heaven would grind thee, thou wouldst not endure.
<lb/>One will hereafter take thy throne and fling
<lb/>Thy fortune to the ground. His name is <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And he will be a royal heaven to earth.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="40"/>
<lb/>As yet he is not born, thy time of woe
<lb/>Hath not arrived, but when his honoured mother
<lb/>Hath borne him he will be a fruitful tree.
<pb n="150"/>
<lb/>At man's estate his head will reach the moon
<lb/>And he will seek thy belt, crown, throne, and casque.
<lb/>In stature a tall cypress, he will shoulder
<lb/>A mace of steel, will smite thy head therewith
<lb/>And drag thee from the palace to the street
<lb/>In bonds.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why bind me,</q> said the impious king,
<lb/><q>In vengeance ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then Zirak: <q>Wert thou but wise...!
<lb/>But all make pretexts for injurious acts.
<lb/>Thy hand will slay his father and that wrong
<lb/>Will fill the son's brains with revengeful thoughts:
<lb/>Besides the nurse of this young atheling—
<lb/>The cow, <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Birmaya</rs></rs> hight—will perish too
<lb/>By thy hand ; so in vengeance he will brandish

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> heard anxiously,
<lb/>And swooned upon his throne. The noble archmage
<lb/>Turned him and fled away in dread of ill.
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> recovered and resumed his seat.
<lb/>He diligently sought throughout the world
<lb/>For traces faint or clear of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> ;
<lb/>No food, no slumber, or repose took he,
<lb/>His daylight turned to lapislazuli.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>The Birth of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>Years passed away, calamity approached

<lb/>Was born, the fashion of the world was changed.
<lb/>Of cypress height he shone forth with the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>
<lb/>Of kings of kings which erst <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName> possessed,

<lb/>Was like the sun, as needful as the rain

<milestone unit="vullers" n="41"/>
<lb/>Revolving heaven loved him tenderly.</p>
<p><lb/>Then lived the cow <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Birmaya</rs></rs>, chief of kine,
<lb/>Born with a coat all bright and peacock-hued.
<lb/>The wise, the archmages, and astrologers
<lb/>Collected round her; none had seen or heard
<lb/>Of such a cow before.</p>
<p><lb/>Meanwhile <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>
<lb/>Was searching everywhere, and filling earth
<lb/>With hue and cry, till <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> became
<lb/>A source of danger to his sire <persName><persName>Abtin</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who fled for life but to the Lion's toils,
<lb/>For certain of the followers of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>,
<lb/>That impious monarch, met <persName><persName>Abtin</persName></persName> one day,
<lb/>Seized him and bore him, like a cheetah bound,
<lb/>Before the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, who had him put to death.</p>
<p><lb/>When Faridiin's wise mother <persName><persName>Faranak</persName></persName>,
<lb/>A glorious dame devoted to her child,
<lb/>Perceived her husband's evil fate she fled ;
<lb/>And came heart-broken weeping to the field
<lb/>Wherein the beautiful <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Birmaya</rs></rs> was.
<lb/>Stull shedding drops of blood she bade the hind :—
<lb/><q>Protect this suckling for me, be a father

<lb/>Ask what thou wilt, e'en to my soul 'tis thine.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The hind replied: <q>I will perform thy bidding

<milestone unit="vullers" n="42"/>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Faranak</persName></persName> resigned the babe to him,
<lb/>With all instructions that were requisite,
<lb/>And that wise guardian like a father fed
<lb/>The child for three years with <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Birmaya</rs></rs>'s milk ;
<lb/>But as <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> ne'er wearied of the search,
<lb/>And as the cow was talked of everywhere,
<lb/>The mother hasted to the field again
<pb n="152"/>
<lb/>And spake thus to the guardian of her child :—
<lb/><q>A prudent thought—a thought inspired by God—
<lb/>Hath risen in my heart. What we must do
<lb/>Is this—there is no remedy, my son
<lb/>And my dear life are one—I must abandon
<lb/>This land of sorcerers, depart unmarked
<lb/>To Hindtstan and bear him to <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then like a roe or one who rideth post
<lb/>She took the young child to that lofty mountain
<lb/>Where dwelt a devotee dead to the world,
<lb/>To whom she said: <q>I am, O holy one!
<lb/>A woeful woman from <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>. Know thou

<lb/>Take thou this child and father him with care.</q>
<lb/>The good man took her child and never breathed
<lb/>One cold breath on him.</p>
<p><lb/>When the rumour reached
<lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> about the cow and field he went,
<lb/>Like some mad elephant, and slew <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Birmaya</rs></rs>,
<lb/>With all the other cattle that he saw
<lb/>Within the field, and harried all the land.

<lb/>Of royal race, discerning mind, wise, brave,
<lb/>And inoffensive, sprung from <persName><persName>Tahmuras</persName></persName> ;
<lb/><persName><persName>Abtin</persName></persName> knew all the pedigree. Thy sire

<lb/>The warlock's shoulders grew two snakes which sucked
<lb/>The life-breath of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>, and thy sire's brains
<lb/>Were taken from his head to feed them. I
<lb/>In course of time came on an open pasture,
<lb/>As yet unknown to fame, and there beheld
<lb/>A cow like jocund spring, well shaped and coloured
<lb/>From head to foot: before her sat her herd
<lb/>Upon his heels as one before a king.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="44"/>
<lb/>I put thee in his charge. For long he nursed thee
<lb/>Upon his breast, the cow of peacock-hues
<lb/>Supplying thee with milk that made thee thrive

<p><lb/>The prince, enraged thereat, mused on revenge,

<lb/>And since the sorcerer hath done his part

<lb/>I have, as sages wot, an enemy

<lb/><q>Illustrious king of earth! may no cold blast
<lb/>From heaven pass o'er thee on the day of battle.
<lb/>Why was this insolent <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName> countenanced
<lb/>As though a friend of thine? He tore the scroll,
<lb/>Refusing to obey thee, and is gone
<lb/>Bent on revenge and leagued, as thou wouldst say,
<lb/>With <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>! A viler deed than this
<lb/>We never saw and marvel such should be.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered quickly: <q>I will tell you wonders.
<lb/>When <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName> entered and I heard his cries,
<lb/>A mount of iron seemed to rise betwixt us;
<lb/>And when he beat his head a strange sensation
<lb/>Convulsed me. How 'twill end I cannot tell;
<lb/>The secrets of the sky are known to none.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName> left the presence of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>A crowd assembled in the market-place.
<pb n="157"/>
<lb/>And still he shouted, crying out for aid
<lb/>And urging all to stand upon their rights.
<lb/>He took a leathern apron, such as smiths
<lb/>Wear to protect their legs while at the forge,
<lb/>Stuck it upon a spear's point and forthwith
<lb/>Throughout the market dust began to rise.
<lb/>He passed along with spear in hand exclaiming :—
<lb/><q>Ye men of name! Ye worshippers of God!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="48"/>
<lb/>Whoe'er would ’scape the fetters of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>
<lb/>Let him resort with me to <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>And shadow in his <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>. Come ye to him;
<lb/>The ruler here is <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>—God's foe.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So that poor leather, worthless as it was,
<lb/>Discriminated friends and enemies.
<lb/>He took the lead, and many valiant men
<lb/>Resorted to him; he rebelled and went
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>. When he arrived shouts rose.
<lb/>He entered the new prince's court, who marked
<lb/>The apron on the spear and hailed the omen.
<lb/>He decked the apron with brocade of <placeName><placeName>Rum</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Of jewelled patterns on a golden ground,
<lb/>Placed on the spearpoint a full moon—a, token
<lb/>Portending gloriously—and having draped it
<lb/>With yellow, red, and violet, he named it
<lb/>The Kawian flag. Thenceforth when any <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>Acceded to the throne, and donned the crown,
<lb/>He hung the worthless apron of the smith
<lb/>With still more jewels, sumptuous brocade,
<lb/>And painted silk of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>. It thus fell out
<lb/>That <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName>'s standard grew to be a sun
<lb/>Amid the gloom of night, and cheered all hearts.</p>
<p><lb/>Time passed and still the world maintained its secret.
<lb/>When <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> saw matters thus, and all men
<lb/>Submiss to vile <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, he came to <persName><persName>Faranak</persName></persName>
<lb/>With girded loins, crowned with a royal casque,
<pb n="158"/>
<lb/>And said: <q>I go to battle, but do thou
<lb/>Devote thyself to prayer. The Maker ruleth.
<lb/>In weal and woe alike clasp hands to Him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With tears and bleeding heart she cried: <q>O God!
<lb/>My trust hath been in Thee. Turn from my son
<milestone unit="vullers" n="49"/>
<lb/>The onslaughts of the wicked on his life,
<lb/>And rid the world of these infatuates.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> gat ready with despatch
<lb/>And secrecy. He had two brothers, both
<lb/>Of noble birth and older than himself,
<lb/>Hight Kaianush and prosperous Purmaya.
<lb/>He said to them: <q>Live, gallant hearts! in joy.
<lb/>Revolving heaven bringeth naught but good ;
<lb/>The crown of power is coming back to us.
<lb/>Provide me cunning smiths and let them make me
<lb/>A massive mace.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They sought the smiths' bazar
<lb/>In haste, whence all the aspiring craftsmen went
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, who taking compasses
<lb/>Showed to the smiths the pattern, tracing it
<lb/>Upon the ground. It had a buffalo's head.
<lb/>They took the work in hand, and having wrought
<lb/>A massive mace they bore it to the hero.
<lb/>It shone as brightly as the noonday sun,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, approving of the work,
<lb/>Bestowed upon the makers raiment, gold,
<lb/>And silver, holding out to them beside
<lb/>Bright hopes and promise of advancement, saying :—
<lb/><q>If I shall lay the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs> in the dust
<lb/>I will not leave the dust upon your heads,
<lb/>But justify the entire world, since I
<lb/>Have Him in mind who judgeth righteously.</q></p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>How <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> went to Battle with <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>With head raised o'er the sun he girt his loins
<lb/>For vengeance for his father, and set forth
<lb/>Upon the day Khurdad right joyfully
<lb/>With favouring stars and splendid auguries.</p>
<p><lb/>The troops assembled at his gate, his throne
<lb/>Was lifted to the clouds. The first to go
<milestone unit="vullers" n="50"/>
<lb/>Were baggage and provisions for the army
<lb/>On buffaloes and high-necked elephants.
<lb/>Purmiaya rode with Kaiantsh beside
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, like younger brothers and true friends.
<lb/>He went like wind from stage to stage; revenge
<lb/>Was in his head and justice in his heart.</p>
<p><lb/>The warriors on their <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> chargers reached
<lb/>A spot where people dwelt who worshipped God,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> dismounting greeted them.
<lb/>When night was darkening one in friendly guise
<lb/>Approached him, walking with a measured tread,
<lb/>With musky hair descending to the feet
<lb/>And favoured like a maid of Paradise.
<lb/>It was <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Surush</rs></rs>, who came thence to advise
<lb/>The king of good and ill, came like a fairy
<lb/>And taught him privily the magic art,
<lb/>That he might know the key of every lock
<lb/>And by his spells bring hidden things to light ;
<lb/>While <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, perceiving that the work
<lb/>Was God's not <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>'s or come of evil,
<lb/>Flushed like a cercis-bloom and joyed to see
<lb/>How lusty he and his young fortune were.</p>
<p><lb/>The cooks prepared a feast—a noble banquet,
<lb/>One fit for mighty men. Now <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The drinking done, being heavy sought repose.
<pb n="160"/>
<lb/>His brothers, seeing that God sped his cause,
<lb/>And that his fortune slumbered not, departed
<lb/>Without delay to compass his destruction.
<lb/>There was above their heads a lofty cliff
<lb/>And underneath the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> slept peacefully.
<lb/>His two abandoned brothers scaled the height
<lb/>That night unseen, and scrupling at no crime
<lb/>Set loose a mighty crag upon the brow
<lb/>To fall directly on their brother's head,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="51"/>
<lb/>And kill him in his sleep. The crashing crag,
<lb/>For God so ordered, roused the slumberer,
<lb/>Who by his magic art arrested it 
<lb/>In mid career: it stopped dead. <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>Went on his way but kept the matter secret.
<lb/>In front marched <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName> with the Kawian standard,
<lb/>Soon to become the ensign of the realm.
<lb/>Thus <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> advanced, as one who sought
<lb/>A diadem, toward the <placeName><placeName>Arwand</placeName></placeName>, or call it,
<lb/>As <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs></rs> do, the Dijla, if thou knowest not
<lb/>The ancient tongue. He marched another stage
<lb/>And came upon the Dijla, at Baghdad.
<lb/>On drawing near he sent to greet the guard
<lb/>And said: <q>Despatch to this side instantly
<lb/>Your boats and vessels, bear me across with all
<lb/>Mine army and let none be left behind.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The river-guard sent not his boats nor came
<lb/>At <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>'s behest, but made reply :—
<lb/><q>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> gave privy orders: <q>Launch no boat
<lb/>Without a passport under mine own seal.</q></q>
<lb/>The prince, enraged and fearless of the stream,
<lb/>Girt like a king and bent upon revenge,
<lb/>Plunged with his rose-red charger in the flood.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="52"/>
<lb/>With one accord his comrades girt themselves,
<lb/>Turned toward the stream, and on their brave, fleet steeds
<pb n="161"/>
<lb/>Plunged over saddle-back. The warriors' heads
<lb/>Reeled while their swift steeds struggled with the tide,
<lb/>And with their necks emerging seemed to be
<lb/>The phantom cohort of adream. The warriors
<lb/>Reached the dry land undamped in their revenge
<lb/>And set their faces toward Bait al Mukaddas.</p>
<p><lb/>This men called when they used the ancient tongue
<lb/>Gang-i-Dizhukht ; to-day 'tis known among
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs></rs> as <q>The Holy Place.</q> The fair
<lb/>Tall palace of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> was builded there.</p>
<p><lb/>When they approached the city that they sought,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> beheld it a mile off,
<lb/>He saw a pile whose building towered o'er <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs></rs>,
<lb/>So that thou wouldst have said: <q>'Twill catch the stars!</q>
<lb/>It shone like <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Jupiter</rs></rs> in heaven; the place i
<lb/>Appeared all peace and love and happiness.
<lb/>The hero recognised that seat of power
<lb/>And springlike beauty as the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s dwelling,
<lb/>And said: <q>The man who reared a pile like that
<lb/>From dust I fear me cottoneth with the world,
<lb/>But still 'tis better to press on than tarry.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This said he grasped his massive mace and gave
<lb/>His fleet steed rein, and thou hadst said: <q>A flame
<lb/>Shot up before the guards.</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="53"/>
<p><lb/>He entered riding— 
<lb/>An inexperienced but valiant youth, 
<lb/>Who called upon the name of God—while they
<lb/>That were on guard fled from him in dismay.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>How <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> saw the Sisters of <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> o'erthrew the talisman,
<lb/>Raised heaven-high by <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, because he saw
<lb/>That it was not of God, with massive mace
<pb n="162"/>
<lb/>Laid low the sorcerers within the palace—
<lb/>All fierce and notable divs—and set himself
<lb/>Upon the enchanter's throne. This done he took
<lb/>Possession of the royal crown and palace,
<lb/>But though he searched he failed to find <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>.
<lb/>Then from the women's bower he brought two Idols
<lb/>Sun-faced, dark-eyed ; he had them bathed, he purged
<lb/>The darkness of their minds by teaching them
<lb/>The way of God and made them wholly clean ;
<lb/>For idol-worshippers had brought them up
<lb/>And they were dazed in mind like drunken folk.
<lb/>Then while the tears from their bright eyes bedewed
<lb/>Their rosy cheeks those sisters of <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>
<lb/>Said thus to <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>: <q>Mayst thou be young
<lb/>Till earth is old! What star was this of thine,
<lb/>O favoured one! What tree bore thee as fruit,
<lb/>Who venturest inside the Lion's lair
<lb/>So hardily, thou mighty man of valour ?
<lb/>What anguish and what bale have we endured
<lb/>All through this dragon-shouldered <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> !
<milestone unit="vullers" n="54"/>
<lb/>Oh! what a miserable world for us
<lb/>Did this infatuated sorcerer make!
<lb/>Yet saw we never here a man so hardy,
<lb/>Bold, and ambitious as to think that he
<lb/>Could take the throne.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered: <q>Throne and fortune
<lb/>Abide with none. My sire was fortune's favourite,
<lb/>But still <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> seized on him in <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>And slew him cruelly, so I have set
<lb/>My face against <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>'s throne in revenge.
<lb/>He slew the cow <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Birmaya</rs></rs> too—my nurse,
<lb/>A very gem of beauty. What could he,
<lb/>That villain, gain by slaughtering that dumb beast ?
<lb/>Now I am ready and I purpose war;
<lb/>I came not from <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> to bring him pardon,
<pb n="163"/>
<lb/>Or good will, but to brain him in revenge
<lb/>With this ox-headed mace.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Arnawaz</persName></persName>
<lb/>Heard this she guessed the secret, and replied :—
<lb/><q>Then thou art <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> and wilt 
<lb/>Abolish necromacy and black art, 
<lb/>For thou art fated to destroy <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> :
<lb/>The binding of thy loins will loose the world.
<lb/>We twain, pure, modest, and of royal seed,
<lb/>Submitted only through the fear of death,
<lb/>Else would we ever sleep or wake, O king!
<lb/>Beside a serpent-spouse ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>If heaven over us shall do me right
<lb/>I will cut off this <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs> from the earth,
<lb/>And purge the world of its impurity.
<lb/>Now speak the truth at once and tell me where
<lb/>That vile one is.</q>
<lb/>Those fair dames told him all ;
<lb/>They thought: <q>The <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s head will meet the shears,</q>
<lb/>And said: <q>He went to <placeName><placeName>Hindustan</placeName></placeName> to practise
<lb/>Some spell-work in that land of sorcerers.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="55"/>
<lb/>He will cut off a thousand innocent heads,
<lb/>For he is terror-struck at evil fortune,
<lb/>Because a seer hath said: <q> Earth will be void
<lb/>Of thee, for <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> will seize thy throne
<lb/>And thy prosperity wither in a moment.</q>
<lb/>Struck by the words his heart is all aflame,
<lb/>And life affordeth him no happiness.
<lb/>Now is he slaughtering beasts and men andwomen
<lb/>To make a bath of blood and thus defeat
<lb/>That prophecy. Those serpents on his shoulders
<lb/>Keep him in long and sore disquietude.
<pb n="164"/>
<lb/>From clime to climne he roveth, for the snakes
<lb/>Give him no rest. 'Tis time for his return,

<p><lb/>Stricken to the heart
<lb/>That lovely pair revealed the mystery:

<lb/>So that his master marvelled at his zeal,
<lb/>One named Kundrav, because he used to limp <ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>Before the unjust king. He came in haste
<lb/>And saw within the hall a stranger crowned,
<lb/>Reposing on the throne, in person like
<lb/>A cypress over which the full moon shineth,
<lb/>On one side <persName><persName>Shahrinaz</persName></persName> the cypress-slim,
<lb/>Upon the other moon-faced <persName><persName>Arnawaz</persName></persName>.
<lb/>The city swarmed with soldiers, and a guard
<lb/>Stood ready armed before the palace-gate.
<lb/>All undismayed, not asking what it meant,
<lb/>Kundrav approached with lowly reverence,
<lb/>Then offered homage, saying: <q>Live, O king!

<lb/>While time shall last. Blest be thy sitting here

<lb/>He told the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> the secrets of his office
<lb/>And was commanded: <q>Serve a royal feast,

<pb n="165"/>
<lb/>To cheer me at the banquet, fill the goblet,
<lb/>Spread out the board, and summon worthy guests.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Kundrav obeyed and brought bright wine and minstrels,
<lb/>And noble guests whose birth entitled them.
<lb/>So <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> quatfed wine and chose the lays
<lb/>And held that night a worthy festival.</p>
<p><lb/>Kundrav at dawn left the new prince in haste
<lb/>And on a swift steed sought <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>. Arrived
<lb/>He told the things that he had seen and heard :—
<lb/><q>O king of chiefs! the token of thy fall
<lb/>Hath come, three men of noble mien arrived
<lb/>With troops; the youngest of the three, in height
<lb/>A cypress and a king in face, is placed
<lb/>Between the other two and hath precedence.
<lb/>His mace is like a mountain-crag and shineth —
<lb/>Amid the host. He entered thine abode
<lb/>On horseback, and the others rode with him—
<lb/>A noble pair. He went and sat upon
<lb/>The royal throne and broke thy charms and spells.
<lb/>As for the divs and warriors in thy palace

<lb/>He struck their heads off as he rode along
<lb/>And mingled brains and blood !</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>'Tis well, guests should enjoy themselves.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Kundrav
<lb/>Retorted: <q>One that hath an ox-head mace!
<lb/>Beware of such in coming and in going;
<lb/>Besides, he sitteth boldly on thy couch,
<lb/>Eraseth from the crown and belt thy name,
<lb/>And maketh thine ungrateful folk his own:
<lb/>If such a guest thou knowest know him such.</q>
<lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> said: <q>Trouble not, it bodeth well
<lb/>When guests are at their ease.</q>
<lb/>Kundrav replied :-—
<lb/><q>Yea, I have heard so; hear thou my rejoinder:
<pb n="166"/>
<lb/>If this great man be any guest of thine
<lb/>What business hath he in thy women's bower ?
<lb/>He sitteth with the sisters of <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>
<lb/>The worldlord, taking counsel, while this hand
<lb/>Is toying with the cheek of <persName><persName>Shahrinaz</persName></persName>
<lb/>And that with <persName><persName>Arnawaz</persName></persName>' carnelian lip.

<p><lb/>Kundrav replied :—
<lb/><q>Henceforth, O king! I deem thy fortune shent.
<lb/>How shouldst thou make me ruler in the city,
<lb/>Or give me even minstrels' work, when thou

<lb/>Now as he neared the city by a byway
<lb/>With valiant divs and warriors, and saw
<lb/>His palace-roofs and gate he vowed revenge.
<lb/>The troops of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> received the tidings
<lb/>And flocked to meet him. Leaping from their steeds
<lb/>They struggled hand to hand. The citizens,
<pb n="167"/>
<lb/>Such as were warlike, manned the roofs and gates
<lb/>For <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>; <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> had maddened them.
<lb/>Bricks from the walls, stones from the roofs, with swords

<lb/>As thick as hail; no place was left to stand.
<lb/>The mountains echoed with the chieftains' shouts,
<lb/>Earth trembled neath the chargers' tramping hoofs,
<lb/>A cloud of black dust gathered, and the flints
<lb/>Were pierced by javelins. From the Fane of Fire
<lb/>One shouted: <q>If some wild beast had been <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>We—young and old—had served him loyally,
<lb/>But not that foul <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> with dragon-shoulders.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The warriors and citizens were blent
<lb/>Together as they fought—a mass of men.
o'er that bright city rose a cloud of dust
<lb/>That turned the sun to lapislazuli.</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="59"/>
<p><lb/>Anon <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> alone in jealous fear
<lb/>Approached the palace, mailed, that none might knowhim.
<lb/>Armed with a lasso sixty cubits long
<lb/>He scaled the lofty edifice in haste
<lb/>And saw beneath him dark-eyed <persName><persName>Shahrinaz</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who toyed bewitchingly with <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>.
<lb/>Her cheeks were like the day, her locks like night,
<lb/>Her lips were opened to revile <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who recognised therein the act of God—
<lb/>A clutch of evil not to be evaded—
<lb/>And with his brain inflamed by jealousy
<lb/>Dropped one end of the lasso to the court
<lb/>And so slid down from that high roof, regardless
<lb/>Of throne and precious life. As he descended
<lb/>He drew a keen-edged poniard from its sheath,
<lb/>Told not his purpose or his name, but clutched
<lb/>The steel-blue dagger in his hand, athirst
<lb/>For blood—the blood of those two beauteous dames.
<pb n="168"/>
<lb/>His feet no sooner rested on the ground
<lb/>Than <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> rushed on him like the wind
<lb/>And beat his helm in with the ox-head mace.
<lb/><q>Strike not,</q> cried blest <persName><persName>Surtish</persName></persName>, who hurried thither,
<lb/><q>His time hath not yet come, but bind him vanquished

<lb/>When <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> heard that he tarried not,
<lb/>But gat a lasso made of lion's hide
<lb/>And bound <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> around the arms and waist
<lb/>With bonds that no huge elephant could snap,
<lb/>Then sitting on <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>'s own golden throne
<lb/>Determined all the evil usages
<lb/>And made a proclamation at the gate :-—

<lb/>Disarm and follow but one path to fame,

<lb/>For citizens and soldiers may not seek

<lb/>Drew near with gladness bringing offerings
<lb/>And heartily accepted <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who graciously received them and discreetly
<lb/>Gave each his rank's due, counselled them at large,
<lb/>And offered up his prayers and thanks to God,
<lb/>Then said: <q>The realm is mine, your fortune's star

<lb/>We ought to walk toward good upon His paths.
<lb/>As king I may not tarry in one place,
<lb/>Else would I pass with you a length of days.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The nobles kissed the ground. Anon the din
<lb/>Of drums rose from the gate whereon all eyes
<lb/>Were fixed, the people yelled against the man,
<lb/>Whose days were almost sped: <q>Bring forth the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>
<lb/>Bound in the lasso's coils as he deserveth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The troops withdrew no wealthier than they came,
<lb/>And took <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, bound shamefully and flung
<lb/>In wretched plight upon a camel's back
<lb/>On this wise to Shirkhan. Call this world old!</p>
<p><lb/>Or ever thou shalt hear this story told.
<lb/>What changes numberless have passed and still

<milestone unit="vullers" n="61"/>
<p><lb/>Thus fortune's favourite bore <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> toward
<lb/>Shirkhan, and driving him among the mountains
<lb/>Was purposing to cast him headlong down,
<lb/>When care the blest <persName><persName>Surtish</persName></persName> and whispered thus
<lb/>The prince in friendly wise: <q>Convey the captive
<lb/>Thus to <placeName><placeName>Mount Damawand</placeName></placeName> with speed, and take
<lb/>No escort, or but what thy safety needeth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bore <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> as one that rideth post
<lb/>And fettered him upon <placeName><placeName>Mount Damawand</placeName></placeName> ;
<lb/>So when new bonds were added to the old,
<lb/>And fate had not another ill in store,
<lb/>The glory of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> became like dust
<lb/>And earth was cleansed froin his abominations,
<lb/>He was removed from kindred and from friends,
<lb/>And bonds alone were left him in the mountains,

<lb/>Bound by the hands upon a crag, that so
<lb/>His anguish might endure. Thus was he left
<lb/>To hang: his heart's blood trickled to the ground.
<lb/>Come let us, lest we tread the world for ill,
<lb/>Be on attaining every good intent ;
<lb/>No good or evil will endure but still
<lb/>Good furnisheth the better monument.
<lb/>A lofty palace, wealth of every kind,
<lb/>Will not avail; thy monument on earth
<lb/>Will be the reputation left behind
<lb/>And therefore deem it not of little worth.
<lb/>No angel was the glorious <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Not musk and ambergris; he strove to win
<lb/>By justice and beneficence the boon
<lb/>Of greatness: be a <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> therein.
<lb/>By godlike travail undertaken he
<lb/>First cleansed the world from its iniquity.
<lb/>The binding of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, that loathly one
<lb/>Devoid of justice, was the chief deed done.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="62"/>
<lb/>He next avenged the murder of <persName><persName>Abtin</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Caused all the world to recognise his sway,

<lb/>O world! how loveless and malign art thou

<lb/>Lo! where is <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> the valiant now,
<lb/>Who took away from old <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> the crown ?
<lb/>Upon this earth five hundred years he reigned

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p>In the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Vedas</rs></rs> we find the expression Trité Aptyd. Tritd is the
ame of a semi-divine personage, who is endowed with the gift
of healing by the gods. Aptyd may be a proper name, a patronymic, or mere epithet. The fact that it is found in connection with
other names besides <persName><persName>Trita</persName></persName>'s rather points to the last. We also
find in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Vedas</rs></rs> a hero named <persName><persName>Traitana</persName></persName>, who is recorded to have
slaina giant. <persName><persName>Trita</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Traitana</persName></persName>, who were probably quite distinct
personages originally, appear to have become confused together
even in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Vedas</rs></rs> themselves, the exploits of each were attributed
to the other also, and the confusion was handed down to later
times. Thus we find <persName><persName>Trita</persName></persName> struggling with the storm-fiend for
the possession of the waters,! and <persName><persName>Traitana</persName></persName> endowed with the gift
of healing. In the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>, Trité Aptyd and Traitand become
three personages—Thrita, Athwya, and <persName><persName>Thraetaona</persName></persName> respectively.
Thrita is there represented as the first healer, and also as the
third who offered the drink-offering of the <rs type="potion"><rs type="potion">Haoma</rs></rs>. The word
Sima is also associated with him, a word which is said to mean
<note n="1">See Introd. p. 7.</note>
<pb n="172"/>
<gloss>appeaser</gloss>, with reference apparently to his medical powers. The
priest and medicine-man were one originally. In reward for
offering the <rs type="potion"><rs type="potion">Haoma</rs></rs> two sons were born to Thrita, of whom one
was the hero <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>, Athwya is represented as being the
second to offer the <rs type="potion"><rs type="potion">Haoma</rs></rs>, and as a reward for so doing a son
is born to him too—<persName><persName>Thraetaona</persName></persName>, whose double character as hero
and physician is clearly indicated. He is described as the smiter
of the dragon Dahaka, and is also worshipped in his capacity as
healer to avert or cure sickness. The word Sama, originally an
epithet applied to Thrita, became applied to his son <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> as
a patronymic. He is thus described as Sama <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>, and a
special epithet is bestowed on him sometimes to the exclusion of
other titles—that of Narimanan, <q>the manly minded.</q></p>
<p>He is described in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs> as <q>the holy <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>, the
Sama, the club-bearer with plaited hair,<ref target="n.1"/> . . . the manly-hearted

accounts of his exploits occur in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>,<ref target="n.3"/> but the fullest
are found in a <rs type="language"><rs type="language">Pahlavi</rs></rs> version of the fourteenth Fargard of the
lost Séidkar Nask. It appears that <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>, great as he was
as a hero, fell a victim to the wiles of one of Abriman's evil
creations—the Pairika Knathaiti, who we are told <q>clave unto
<persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>.</q><ref target="n.4"/> The Pairika is the Pari, our Peri or Fairy, and
symbolises idolatry in <rs type="religion"><rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs></rs> mythology. <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> therefore neglected the worship of fire and became an idolater. For
this he was cast into hell, where he remained till <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs>, having
heard him commended by <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName>, summoned him, and he pleaded
to be released in consideration of the good works achieved by him
while on earth. He urged that he slew the serpent Srovbar,
<q>which was swallowing horses and swallowing men, and its teeth
were as long as my arm, its ear was as large as fourteen blankets,
its eye was as large as a wheel, and its horn was as much as <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dahak</rs></rs> <ref target="n.6"/>
in height. And I was running as much as half a day on its back,
tillzts head was smitten by me at the neck with a club made for
my hand, and it was slain outright by me... by me <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Gandarep</rs></rs><ref target="n.7"/>

were sticking among his teeth ; and my beard was seized by him,

and I dragged him out of the sea; nine days and nights the
conflict was maintained by us in the sea, and then I became more
powerful than <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Gandarep</rs></rs>. The sole of <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Gandarep</rs></rs>'s foot was also
seized by me, and the skin was flayed off up to hes head, and
with it the hands and feet of <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Gandarep</rs></rs> were bound... and
<rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Gandarep</rs></rs> was taken arid slain by me... Grant me, O Auharmazd! heaven or the supreme heaven! for I have slain the highwaymen who were so big in body that, when they were walking,
people considered in this way, that ‘below them are the stars and
moon, and below them moves the sun at dawn, and the water of
the sea reaches up to their knees.’ And I reached up to their
legs, and they were smitten on the legs by me; they fell, and the
hills on the earth were shattered by them.</q> <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> went on
to tell how the demons urged on the wind to attack him, how it
came on in its strength, uprooting every shrub, and tree, and
reducing earth to powder in its path, and how he withstood it
and prevailed. He finally pleaded that when, in the fulness of
time, <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> shall escape from the fetters wherewith <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
bound him to Mount Damdwand, and threaten the world with
destruction, he (<persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>) alone can conquer and finally destroy
that evil spirit. <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs>, in consideration for the outraged spirit
of fire, long remained obdurate to the pleadings of <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName>,
though supported by those of <persName><persName>Zoroaster</persName></persName> himself and others, but
finally yielded, and <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> was admitted into heaven.<ref target="n.1"/></p>
<p>With regard to the final destruction of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> by <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> we
find information in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs> and in the <persName><persName>Bahman</persName></persName> Yast.
Combining the accounts given, we learn that <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> obtained
immortality while on earth, but that owing to his slighting fireworship he was wounded by a Turk named Nihav, and fell asleep
in the valley of Pishin in <placeName><placeName>Kabulistan</placeName></placeName>. He is there watched over
by the divine glory, and by the guardian spirits of the righteous
till the epoch when the powers of evil shall rally for the last
great struggle against good, and <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> summon <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> from
<placeName><placeName>Mount Damawand</placeName></placeName>. <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> will rush forth freed from the fetters
of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, first apparently swallow <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> himself, and then a
third of mankind, cattle, sheep, and other creatures of Urmuad,
smite the water, fire, and vegetation, and commit grievous sin.
Then the water, the fire, and vegetation will lament before
<rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> and, pray that <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> may be revived to slay <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>,

<note n="1">WPT, ii. 369-382.</note>
<pb n="174"/>
At the fourth summons he will wake and go forth to encounter
<persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, smite him on the head with the famous club, and slay

<lb/>In those days, apprehensive of no evil,

<p><lb/>At length news of the happy youth arrived

<lb/>It seemed the time to ope the treasury,

<lb/>Habergeons, helmets, double-headed darts,

<lb/>Art thou ambassador or principal ?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Jandal</persName></persName> replied: <q>May every joy be thine,

<lb/>I come as some poor heathen to convey
<lb/>A message from <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>. Great <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>Saluteth thee by me. Thou ask'st my business:
<lb/>I answer: Mighty <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> applaudeth thee,
<lb/>And great are they whom he despiseth not.
<lb/>He said: <q>Say to the monarch of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName> :—
<lb/>So long as musk hath scent perfume the throne,
<lb/>Be thy griefs scattered and thy wealth amassed,
<lb/>And ever, king of <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs></rs>! mayst thou be
<lb/>Safeguarded by the stars from all mishap.
<lb/>What thing is there more sweet than life and children ?
<lb/>Yea, they are sweeter than all else beside,
<lb/>For none is dearer than a child, that bond
<lb/>Is as no other bond. If any man
<lb/>Hath three eyes I possess them in my sons,
<lb/>But know that they are better still than eyes
<lb/>For those that look on them give thanks. What said
<pb n="179"/>
<lb/>The sage when he defined a proper league ?
<lb/><q>I ne'er ally myself but with my betters.</q>
<lb/>A sage intent on good will seek his friends
<lb/>Among his peers, men may be fortunate
<lb/>But monarchs are not well without a host.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="67"/>
<lb/>My realm is prosperous, I have treasure, might,
<lb/>And daring, with three sons who well deserve
<lb/>To reign—wise, men of knowledge and of prowess,
<lb/>Without a want or wish unsatisfied.
<lb/>For these three princes in domestic life
<lb/>I need three consorts of a royal race,
<lb/>And I have news (whereon I send in haste)
<lb/>By means of mine informants that thou hast
<lb/>Among the ladies that are in thy bower,
<lb/>O honour-loving king! three maiden daughters
<lb/>As yet unnamed, whereat my heart rejoiced,
<lb/>For my three sons of course are nameless still.
<lb/>'Twere surely well for us to intermingle
<lb/>These precious gems of two varieties,
<lb/>Three virtuous maids with three aspiring princes,
<lb/>Fit joined to fit, no room for scandal there.</q>
<lb/>Such is his message; think of thy reply.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The monarch of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName> drooped like the jasmine
<lb/>When out of water, thinking: <q>If these Moons
<lb/>Are taken from me, and I see them not
<lb/>About my couch, my day will turn to night.
<lb/>No need to answer yet; I will consult
<lb/>With those who share with me the consequence.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He first assigned the ambassador a lodging,
<lb/>Then having closed the audience sat and pondered.</p>
<p><lb/>The monarch summoned from the Bedouins
<lb/>Full many a chieftain well approved in war,
<lb/>And made the matter manifest to all :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="68"/>
<lb/><q>I have as only issue of my wedlock
<lb/>Three Lights that are resplendent in mine eyes,
<pb n="180"/>
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> hath sent an embassage
<lb/>To spread a goodly snare before my feet ;
<lb/>He would deprive me of these Eyes of mine,
<lb/>And I would fain consult thereon with you.
<lb/>The ambassador saith thus: <q>Thus saith the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> :—
<lb/><q>I have three princes who adorn my throne
<lb/>And seek for favour and affinity
<lb/>With thee by marriage with thy virtuous daughters.</q></q>
<lb/>If I shall answer, <q> Yes,</q> and mean it not,
<lb/>'Twill be a lie; to le is not for kings;
<lb/>If I shall acquiesce in his request
<lb/>My heart will be on fire, my face all tears ;
<lb/>And if I shall refuse my heart will feel
<lb/>His vengeance—not a matter for a jest
<lb/>From one who is the monarch of the world ;
<lb/>And travellers too have heard of what <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>
<lb/>Hath suffered from him. Now advise me well.</q>
<lb/>The veteran valiant chiefs thus made reply :—
<lb/><q>We disapprove of veering to each gust.
<lb/>Be <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> however great a king
<lb/>No earringed slaves are we, but say our say
<lb/>And take the consequence. 'Tis ours to handle
<lb/>The bridle and the lance; we make the earth
<lb/>A winefat with our swords, we make the air
<lb/>A reed-bed with our spears. If thy three children
<lb/>Are held so dear unlock thy treasury
<lb/>And shut thy lips; or, if thou wilt use craft,
<lb/>But fearest <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, make such demands
<lb/>That none shall ever hear the like again.</q>
<lb/>The king heard while the chieftains said their say,

<p><lb/>At length he called the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>'s ambassador

<lb/><q>I am the servant of thy lord; in all
<lb/>That he commandeth me will I obey.
<lb/>Thus say to him: <q> Exalted as thou art,
<lb/>Still thy three sons are precious unto thee;
<lb/>And kings esteem their own sons very precious
<lb/>When they are such as ornament the throne.
<lb/>I grant what thou hast said, I too have children
<lb/>And judge by them; yet if the mighty <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>Were to require mine eyes of me, or ask
<lb/>The kingdom of Yainan and desert-tribes,
<lb/>It were of lesser moment than for me

<lb/>Still if the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> wish this I may not walk
<lb/>Save as he biddeth me, and my three children,

_ But when shali I behold those princely sons

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Jandal</persName></persName>, the sweet-voiced speaker
<lb/>On hearing kissed the throne with reverence,
<pb n="182"/>
<lb/>Then uttering praises hied him to his lord,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="70"/>
<lb/>To whom he told what he had said and heard.
<lb/>The monarch bade his sons attend, he spake
<lb/>About the mission of <persName><persName>Jandal</persName></persName>, and said :—
<lb/><q>The monarch of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName> is king of peoples,
<lb/><persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> is a cypress throwing lengthy shadows.
<lb/>He hath three daughters—pearls as yet unpierceed—
<lb/>Who are his crown, for he hath not a son.
<lb/>Before all three of them <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Surush</rs></rs> would kiss
<lb/>The ground, I ween, if he might have such brides.
<lb/>These I demanded of their sire for you
<lb/>And took such order as becometh us.
<lb/>Your duty now will be to go to him,
<lb/>But be discreet in all things small and great.
<lb/>Be complaisant but guarded therewithal,
<lb/>Heed what he saith and answer courteously.
<lb/>If he consulteth you advise him well.
<lb/>Now hearken to my words and ye shall prosper :
<lb/>Among the peoples none can equal <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName>,
<lb/>For he is fluent, ardent, shrewd, and pure.
<lb/>Allow him not to find you off your guard,
<lb/>For wise men work with subtilty. The first day
<lb/>He will assign you chief seats at a feast,
<lb/>Bring forth three sun-faced maids like garths in spring,
<lb/>All full of grace, of colour, and perfume,
<lb/>And seat them on the throne, these Cypresses
<milestone unit="vullers" n="71"/>
<lb/>In height and in appearance so alike
<lb/>That none could tell their order as to age.
<lb/>Now of these three the youngest will walk first,
<lb/>The eldest last, the other in the midst.
<lb/>The king will place the youngest maid beside
<lb/>The eldest youth, beside the youngest prince
<lb/>The eldest maid, and pair the mid in age.
<lb/>Know, for 'tis worth your while, that he will ask :—
<lb/><q>How range ye in respect of age these damsels ?</q>
<pb n="183"/>
<lb/>Reply: <q>The youngest hath the highest place,
<lb/>The eldest hath a place below her rank,
<lb/>The mid in age is placed as she should be,
<lb/>And thou hast failed in this attempt of thine.</q></q>
<lb/>The pure and high-born three paid all regard
<lb/>To what their father said, and left his presence
<lb/>Fulfilled with wisdom and with artifice.
<lb/>How should the sons by such a father taught
<lb/>Be ill advised or indiscreet in aught ?</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How the Sons of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> went to the King of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName></head>
<p><lb/>They summoned archimages and made ready ;

<lb/>All men of name with sunlike countenances.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName>, hearing of their coming, decked his host
<milestone unit="vullers" n="72"/>
<lb/>Like pheasant's plumes, and sent to welcome them
<lb/>A. goodly band of kinsfolk and of magnates.
<lb/>As those three noble princes reached <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Both men and women met them on their way,
<lb/>Bestrewing saffron mixed with precious jewels
<lb/>And mingling musk with wine. The horses' manes
<lb/>Were drenched therewith, and underneath their feet
<lb/>Gold coins were flung. A palace was prepared
<lb/>Like Paradise itself; they overlaid
<lb/>The bricks with gold and silver; all the hangings
<lb/>Were of brocade of Rim—a mass of wealth.
<lb/>There <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> disposed his guests and by the morn
<lb/>Had put them at their ease. He brought his daughters,
<lb/>As <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> had said, out of their bowers,
<lb/>Like shining moons too dazzling for the eye,
<lb/>And ranged them just as <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> foretold.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="73"/>
<pb n="184"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> asked the eldest prince: <q>Which is the youngest
<lb/>Of these three Stars, which is the mid in age,
<lb/>And which the eldest? Thus distinguish them.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They answered as they had been taught, and so
<lb/>Sewed up the eyelids of his craft, while he
<lb/>And all his warriors were lost in wonder.
<lb/>He saw that his inversion naught availed
<lb/>And answered, <q>Yea,</q> and paired the pairs aright.
<lb/>The introduction ended in betrothal.
<lb/>The three princesses, blushing for their father,
<lb/>Went from the presence of the three young princes
<lb/>In sweet confusion, blushes on their cheek
<lb/>And many a word of tenderness to speak.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> proved the Sons of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> by Sorcery</head>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> assembled boon-companions
<lb/>And passed the day with minstrels, wine, and talk,
<lb/>But his three sons-in-law—the sons of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>—
<lb/>Drank not except to him. When wine prevailed,
<lb/>And sleep and rest were needed, <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> bade set
<lb/>Some couches by a fountain of rose-water,
<lb/>And there the three illustrious athelings
<lb/>Slept in a garden in a bower of roses,
<lb/>Which scattered blossoms o'er them, but meanwhile
<lb/>The sorcerer-king had thought of a device:
<lb/>He left the royal pleasance and prepared
<lb/>His spells. He brought a frost and mighty blast
<lb/>To slay the princes; over hill and plain
<lb/>It froze so sharply that the crows grew numb.
<lb/>The arch-enchanter <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>'s three sons
<lb/>Leapt from their couches at the grievous cold ;
<pb n="185"/>
<lb/>And by the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> of God and their own skill,
<lb/>By kingly magic and their hardihood,
<lb/>Opposed the spell and kept the frost away.
<lb/>Now when the sun shone o'er the mountain-tops,
<lb/><persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName>, anxious to know all, approached in haste
<lb/>His three exalted sons-in-law in hope
<lb/>To find their cheeks like lapislazuli,
<lb/>Congealed with frost, and their emprise defeated,
<lb/>So that his daughters might remain to him
<lb/>As his memorial; such was his hope,
<lb/>But sun and moon were adverse to his wishes,
<lb/>For he beheld three princes like new moons
<lb/>Fresh-seated on their royal thrones, and knew
<lb/>That spells had failed him and his time was lost.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="74"/>
<lb/>He gave an audience; all the chiefs attended.
<lb/>He opened and brought forth his ancient treasures,
<lb/>Disclosing what had been secreted long,
<lb/>And brought too and committed to their lords
<lb/>Three maids sun-cheeked, like garths of Paradise
<lb/>(No archimage ere planted pines like them),
<lb/>With crowns and trinkets, ignorant of pain,
<lb/>Unless it be a pain to plait the hair:
<lb/>They were three new Moons and three warriorkings.
<lb/>He thought with bitterness: <q>The fault is mine,
<lb/>Not <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>'s, and may I never hear
<lb/>Of female issue from this royal stock ;
<lb/>He hath a lucky star who hath not daughters,
<lb/>But he who hath them hath no star to shine.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then to the assembled sages: <q>Kings may well
<lb/>Wed Moons. Bear witness all! that I have given
<lb/>My three Eyes to these men in lawful marriage,
<lb/>To hold thein dear as their own eyes are dear,
<lb/>And limn them like their own lives on their hearts,</q>
<pb n="186"/>
<lb/>He uttered this aloud and then he bound
<lb/>On many vigorous camels' lusty backs
<lb/>The baggage of the brides. <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName> was bright
<lb/>With gems. The daughters' litters moved in file
<lb/>With parasols and riches fit for kings.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> ordered everything and said farewell.
<lb/>Thus did the youths set out upon their way
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> with hearts alert and gay.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>How <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> made Trial of his Sons</head>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="75"/>
<p><lb/>When tidings that the princes had returned
<lb/>Reached <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> he went to meet them, longing,
<lb/>By trial of their characters, to end
<lb/>His boding fears, so changed him to a dragon—
<lb/>One, thou wouldst say, no lion could escape—
<lb/>Which hissed and bellowed with its jaws aflame.
<lb/>As soon as he perceived his three sons near,
<lb/>Like sombre mountains in a cloud of dust,
<lb/>He too threw dust about and made it fly,
<lb/>While earth re-echoed with his bellowings.
<lb/>He rushed in fury toward his eldest son,
<lb/>That prince of many virtues, who exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>No man of sense and wisdom thinketh good
<lb/>To fight with dragons.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then he showed his back
<lb/>And fled. The father turned toward the next,
<lb/>His second son, who when he saw the dragon
<lb/>Strung up his bow and drew it, saying thus :—
<lb/><q>When fight is toward, what matter if the foe
<lb/>Be roaring lion or brave cavalier ? </q></p>
<p><lb/>But when the youngest son came up he looked
<lb/>Upon the dragon and cried out: <q>Avaunt!
<lb/>Thou art a leopard: ware the lions' path !
<pb n="187"/>
<lb/>If e'er the name of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> hath reached
<lb/>Thine ears contend not with us, for we three
<lb/>Are sons of his, and every one of us
<lb/>A wielder of the mace, and warrior.
<lb/>Unless thou turnest from thy waywardness
<lb/>I will discrown thee of thy loathly face.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The glorious <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> thus heard and saw,
<lb/>And having proved their. mettle disappeared.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="76"/>
<lb/>He went away but came back as their sire
<lb/>With all the pomp and circumstance befitting,
<lb/>With kettledrums and huge fierce elephants
<lb/>And bearing in his hand the ox-head mace.
<lb/>The leaders of the host were at his back,
<lb/>And all the world was his. The noble princes
<lb/>Dismounted when they saw the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, they ran
<lb/>To him and kissed the ground, dazed at the din
<lb/>Made by the elephants and kettledrums.
<lb/>The father grasped their hands and welcomed them,
<lb/>Each to his proper place. On his return
<lb/>He prayed and offered up much thanks to God—
<lb/>The Author of his weal and of his woe—
<lb/>Then summoned his three sons and seating them
<lb/>Upon the throne of majesty spake thus :—
<lb/><q>That loathly dragon which would scorch the world
<lb/>Was your own father, who desired to prove
<lb/>Your mettle, and this known returned with joy.
<lb/>Now in my wisdom I have chosen fit names
<lb/>For you. Thou art the eldest, be thou Salin
<lb/>And have thy wish on earth—thou soughtest safety
<lb/>And didst not shun to flee the monster's maw.
<lb/>The rash man who despiseth elephants
<lb/>Or lions—call him frantic and not brave.
<lb/>My second son, who from the first showed fight,
<lb/>Whose courage is more ardent than a flame,
<pb n="188"/>
<lb/>Him name we <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>—a lion brave; not even
<lb/>A mighty elephant could vanquish him.
<lb/>To dare is all the virtues in his case,
<lb/>For no faint heart is master of a throne.
<lb/>The youngest is a man of sleight and fight,
<lb/>One that can bide his time and yet be prompt.
<lb/>He chose the middle course 'twixt dust and flame,
<lb/>The prudent man's. Brave, young, and sensible
<milestone unit="vullers" n="77"/>
<lb/>He must alone be praised. Be he <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>, 
<lb/>And may his end be all supremacy,
<lb/>Because at first he was not choleric,
<lb/>But at the time of stress his courage grew.
<lb/>I open now my lips with joy to name

<p><lb/>Now when the envoy brought this answer back
<lb/>The face of that veiled secret was laid bare,
<lb/>This brother came from <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName> and that from <placeName><placeName>Rum</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And, poison being mixed with honey thus,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><head>How <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> sent a Message to <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>They chose a priest, a shrewd, bright, heedful man
<lb/>And plausible, and then excluding strangers
<lb/>Concerted plans. <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> put their case in words,
<lb/>Washed off all tilial reverence from his eyes,
<lb/>And thus addressed the envoy: <q>Hence away,
<lb/>In spite of dust and tempest, swift as wind
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> and heed not aught beside.
<lb/>On reaching him greet him in both our names
<lb/>And say: <q>In heaven and earth the fear of God
<lb/>Should equally prevail, the young may hope
<lb/>To see old age, but hoar hairs turn not black.
<lb/>By long abiding in this straitened place
<lb/>Thou straitenest the long home for thyself.
<lb/>All-holy God bestowed the world upon thee
<lb/>From yonder bright sun unto sombre earth,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="81"/>
<lb/>Yet didst thou choose to act in mere caprice,
<lb/>Not heeding His commands, and to entreat
<lb/>Thy sons with scath and fraud instead of justice; _
<lb/>For thou hadst three, wise, brave, and youths no longer,
<pb n="192"/>
<lb/>And though no excellence appeared in one
<lb/>So that the others should bow down to him,
<lb/>Yet one thou blastedst with a dragon's breath,
<lb/>Another's head thou raisedst to the clouds ;
<lb/>On one thine eyes reposed with joy, and he
<lb/>Now hath the crown and is beside thy couch,
<lb/>While we who are as good as he by birth
<lb/>Are deemed unworthy of the royal throne.
<lb/>O upright judge and monarch of the world!
<lb/>May justice such as this be never blessed!
<lb/>If then his worthless head shall be discrowned,
<lb/>Earth rescued from his sway, and thou wilt give him
<lb/>Some corner of the world where he may sit

<p><lb/>The priest at this harsh message kissed the ground,

<lb/>When he approached the court of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>And marked the cloud-capt buildings from afar,
<lb/>Which stretched from range to range, while at the gate
<lb/>Chiefs sat and those of highest rank behind
<lb/>The curtain, on the one side pards and lions

<lb/><q>Tt must be heaven,</q> he thought, <q>and not a court :

<p><lb/>The wary watchman went and told the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> :—
<lb/><q>A man of noble mien and high estate

<p><lb/>He bade

<lb/>The envoy, when dismounted, to the court,
<lb/>Who when he saw the face of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Saw how the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> engrossed all eyes and hearts,
<lb/>His stature cypress-like, his face a sun,
<lb/>His hair like camphor and his rose-red cheeks,
<lb/>His smiling lips, his modest countenance,
<lb/>And royal mouth, which uttered gracious words,
<lb/>Did reverence and wore the ground with kisses.
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> commanded him to rise and sit
<lb/>Upon the seat of honour due to him,
<lb/>Then asked him first about the noble pair :—
<lb/><q>Enjoy they health and happiness?</q> and next

<p><lb/>He answered: <q>Noble <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>!May none behold the world without thee! Those

<lb/>The message that I bring to thee is harsh

<p><lb/>When he had heard, the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>'s brain seethed with anger.
<lb/><q>Q man of prudence!</q> thus he made reply,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="83"/>
<lb/><q>Thou needest no excuse, for I have eyes
<lb/>And have discerned this for myself already.
<pb n="194"/>
<lb/>Tell mine unholy and abandoned sons—
<lb/>This pair of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahrimans</rs></rs> with dregs of brains :—
<lb/><q>'Tis well that ye reveal your natures thus
<lb/>And send a greeting worthy of yourselves ;
<lb/>For if your brains are empty of my teaching,
<lb/>And ye have no idea what wisdom is,
<lb/>Not fearing God, ye could not well do other.
<lb/>My hair was once as black as pitch, my stature
<lb/>Was cypress-tall, my face was like the moon.
<lb/>The sky which hath bent down this back of mine
<lb/>Is yet unfallen and revolveth still:
<lb/>So time will bend you too, and even that
<lb/>Which bendeth you itself will not endure.
<lb/>Now by the highest name of holy God, ~
<lb/>By yon bright sun, and by the teeming ground,
<lb/>By throne, by crown, by <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs></rs> and the moon,
<lb/>I never cast an evil look upon you.
<lb/>I called the sages into conference,
<lb/>The archimages and astrologers ;
<lb/>Abundant time was spent therein that so
<lb/>We might divide the earth with equity ;
<lb/>I had no object but to deal with fairness ;
<lb/>There was no knavery from first to last ;
<lb/>My secret motive was the fear of God,
<lb/>My longing to fulfil all righteousness ;
<lb/>Since earth was given to me full of men
<lb/>It was no wish of mine to scatter them ;
<lb/>I said: <q>On each of my three lucky Eyes
<lb/>Will I bestow a populous dominion.</q>
<lb/>If <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> hath now seduced your hearts
<lb/>From mine advice to dark and crookéd ways,
<lb/>Consider if the Omnipotent will look
<lb/>With approbation on this deed of yours.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="84"/>
<lb/>One proverb will I speak if ye will hear :—
<lb/><q>The crop that ye have sown that shall ye reap.</q>
<pb n="195"/>
<lb/>He that instructed me was wont to say :—
<lb/><q>Our other home is that which will endure.</q>
<lb/>But your lusts sit where reason should be throned.
<lb/>Why are ye thus confederate with the <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Div</rs></rs>?
<lb/>I fear that in that <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s clutch your bodies
<lb/>And souls will part. Now that I leave the world
<lb/>It is no time for wrath and bitterness ;
<lb/>Yet thus he saith—the man consumed with years,
<lb/>Who had three sons, three men of noble birth :—
<lb/>By hearts released from passions dust is held
<lb/>As precious as the wealth of king of kings;
<lb/>But whoso selleth brother for the dust
<lb/>Men rightly say that he was bastard-born.
<lb/>The world hath seen and will see men like you
<lb/>In plenty; but it cottoneth to none.
<lb/>Now if ye know aught of avail with God
<lb/>To save you on the Day of Reckoning,
<lb/>Seek that, make it the provand for the way
<lb/>And be less careful for the things of earth !</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The envoy hearing kissed the ground and went ;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>His way-mate is the wind.</q> —
<lb/>The envoy being gone the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> resumed
<lb/>His seat, then called his noble son <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>
<lb/>And told both what had chanced and what might be -—
<lb/><q>Those sons of mine with hearts intent on war
<lb/>Have set themselves against us from the West.
<lb/>Their stars dispose them to delight in ill;
<lb/>Besides their troughs are in two provinces,
<lb/>Whose fruit is savagery. They will enact
<lb/>The brother's part while thou shalt wear the crown,
<lb/>And when thy ruddy face is pale in death
<lb/>Will shun thy pillow. If thou puttest love
<lb/>Before the sword thy head will ache with strife,
<lb/>For from both corners of the world my sons
<pb n="196"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="85"/>
<lb/>Have shown their real intent. If thou wouldst fight 
<lb/>Make ready, ope the treasury, bind the baggage ;
<lb/>Secure the cup while thou art breaking fast,
<lb/>For if not they will sup on thee, my son!
<lb/>Thou needst not earthly helpers, thine allies
<lb/>Are truth and mnocence.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The good <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>
<lb/>Gazed on that loving <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, his glorious sire,
<lb/>And said: <q>My lord! consider how time passeth
<lb/>Like wind above us. Why should wise'men fret ?
<lb/>It withereth the cheek of cercis-bloom,
<lb/>It darkeneth the radiant spirit's eyes;
<lb/>It is at first a gain and then a pain,
<lb/>And when the pain is done we pass away.
<lb/>Since then our couch is dust, our pillow brick,
<lb/>Why plant to-day a tree whose roots will ever
<lb/>Be drinking blood, whose fruit will be revenge ?
<lb/>The earth hath seen and will see many lords
<lb/>With scimitar and throne and signet-ring
<lb/>Like us; but they who wore the crown of old
<lb/>Made not a habit of revenge. I too,
<lb/>The king permitting, will not live in ill.
<lb/>I want not crown and throne. I will approach
<lb/>My brothers in all haste and unattended,
<lb/>And say: <q> My lords, dear as my soul and body!
<lb/>Forbear your anger and abandon strife:
<lb/>Strife is unlovely in religious men.
<lb/>Why set your hopes so much upon this world ?
<lb/>How ill it used <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName> who passed away
<lb/>At last, and lost the crown and throne and girdle!
<lb/>And you and I at length must share his lot.
<lb/>Live we in joy together and thus safe
<milestone unit="vullers" n="86"/>
<lb/>From foes.</q> I will convert their vengeful hearts :
<lb/>What better vengeance can I take than that?</q>
<pb n="197"/>
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> replied: <q>Thy brethren, my wise son!
<lb/>Are set on fight while thou wouldst have a feast.
<lb/>I cannot but recall this saw to mind :—
<lb/><q>It is no marvel if the moon is bright.</q>
<lb/>An answer such as thine becometh well
<lb/>Thy virtuous self; thou art for brotherhood
<lb/>And love, but doth a prudent man expose
<lb/>His priceless life and head to dragon's breath,
<lb/>Since naught but biting venom cometh thence
<lb/>By nature? Yet, if such be thy resolve,
<lb/>Take order for thy going and set forth.
<lb/>Select a retinue among the troops
<lb/>To go with thee, and I will write a letter,
<lb/>With sorrow in my heart, to those two men.
<lb/>Oh! may thy safe return rejoice my sight,
<lb/>For when I look on thee my soul is bright.</q></p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><head>How <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> went to his Brothers</head>
<p><lb/>The great <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> wrote a letter to the lord
<lb/>Of all the West and to the king of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Wherein he offered first his praise to God
<lb/>Who is and will be to eternity,
<lb/>And then went on: <q>This letter of good counsel
<lb/>Is for two Suns at their meridian,
<lb/>Two men of weight and courage, kings of earth,
<lb/>One monarch of the West, the other of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>From him who hath surveyed the world throughout,
<lb/>To whom mysterious things have been disclosed,
<lb/>Who brandisheth the sword and massive mace,
<lb/>Who addeth lustre unto famous crowns,
<lb/>Who turneth into night the light of day,
<lb/>Who openeth the hoards of hope and fear,
<pb n="198"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="87"/>
<lb/>To whom all labours have grown easy, one
<lb/>In whom all'splendour hath displayed itself.
<lb/>I do not ask of you your diadems,
<lb/>Your hoarded treasures, thrones, or palaces:
<lb/>My wish is, after all my weary toils,
<lb/>That my three sons should dwell in peace and love.
<lb/>The brother as to whom your hearts are sore
<lb/>(Though none hath felt a chilling breath from him)
<lb/>Doth come in haste because of your chagrin,
<lb/>And of his eagerness to see you both.
<lb/>He hath resigned his kingship for your sakes—
<lb/>An action worthy of the noblest men—
<lb/>And taking to the saddle from the throne
<lb/>Hath girt his loins that he may do you service.
<lb/>Now since he is the youngest of the three
<lb/>He hath a right to love and tenderness.
<lb/>Hold him in honour, and repent yourselves ;
<lb/>As I have fed his body feed his soul,
<lb/>And after he hath been with you awhile
<lb/>Send my beloved one back to me.</q>
<lb/>They sealed
<lb/>The letter with the signet of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>.
<lb/><persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> set forth with such attendants only,
<lb/>Both young and old, as were imperative ;
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>, when he was drawing nigh,
<lb/>Unwitting of their dark design, led forth
<lb/>The troops to meet him as their custom was.
<lb/>When they beheld their brother's face of love
<lb/>They showed to him an altered countenance,
<lb/>And bent on quarrel gave the peaceful one
<lb/>A greeting but not such as he desired.
<lb/>Two hearts were full of vengeance, one was calm:
<lb/>Thus all three brothers sought their royal tents.</p>
<p><lb/>The troops saw, as they looked upon <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>,
<lb/>That he was worthy of the throne and crown,
<pb n="199"/>
<lb/>And could not rest because the love of him
<lb/>Possessed their hearts e'en as his face their eyes ;
<lb/>And when, dispersing, mate went off with mate,
<lb/>Their talk in private was about <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="88"/>
<lb/><q>This is the one to be the king of kings!
<lb/>May none beside him have the crown of might.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> from apart was spying on the troops,
<lb/>Their doings made him heavy, and he sought
<lb/>His royal tent with a revengeful heart,
<lb/>With liver full of blood, and frowning brows.
<lb/>He had the enclosure cleared while he and <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>
<lb/>Sat with their counsellors, and talked at large
<lb/>Of kingship, crown, and all the provinces;
<lb/>And in the midst thereof <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> said to <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>:
<lb/><q>Why have the soldiers scattered into groups?
<lb/>Didst thou not mark how, when we were returning,
<lb/>The soldiers as they passed along the road
<lb/>Could not refrain from looking at <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> ?
<lb/>Our troops when they came back were altered men.
<lb/>He turned my heart to gloom, thoughts thronged, I saw
<lb/>That henceforth they would wish no <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> but him.
<lb/>Unless thou shalt uproot him thou wilt fall
<lb/>From thine exalted throne beneath his feet.</q></p>
<p><lb/>In such a mind they closed the interview

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><head>How <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> was Slain by his Brothers</head>
<p><lb/>Now when the veil was lifted from the sun,
<lb/>As morning dawned and slumber passed away,
<lb/>The hearts of that insensate pair were eager
<lb/>To do their deed of shame; they proudly strode
<lb/>Toward their royal brother's tent. <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who saw them coming, met them tenderly.
<pb n="200"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="89"/>
<lb/>They went with him inside the tent. The talk
<lb/>Ran on the why and wherefore of his coming.
<lb/><persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> said to him: <q>Since thou art youngest born
<lb/>Why shouldst thou take the crown of power? Must thou
<lb/>Possess the throne of princes and <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>While I am bondslave at the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs>'s gate ?
<lb/>Thine eldest brother chafeth in the West
<lb/>While thou art crowned and walkest over treasure,
<lb/>For thus did our aspiring sire apportion
<lb/>The world in favour of his youngest son.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> made answer in a holier strain :—
<lb/><q>O mighty chieftain, lover of renown !
<lb/>Seek peace if thou wouldst have thy heart at ease.
<lb/>I do not want the royal crown or throne,
<lb/>The style of monarch or the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> host ;
<lb/>I do not want <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>, the West, or <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>The kingship or the broad expanse of earth.
<lb/>When majesty produceth naught but strife
<lb/>One needs must weep o'er such supremacy.
<lb/>Although thou ridest on the heaven above,
<lb/>A brick will be thy pillow in the end.
<lb/>For my part, though the master of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>I am aweary both of crown and throne,
<lb/>And yield to you the diadem and signet,
<lb/>So hate me not; there is no feud between us,
<lb/>No heart need ache through me. I will not have
<lb/>The world against your will, and though I dwell
<lb/>Far from your ken I ever act as younger:
<lb/>My Faith is naught without humanity.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> heard the words and little heeded them,
<lb/>But, angry that <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> should speak and caring
<lb/>No jot for peace, he rose up with a cry
<lb/>And then advancing suddenly, and grasping
<lb/>The massive seat of gold, he smote <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>,
<pb n="201"/>
<lb/>Who pleaded for his life: <q>Hast thou no fear
<milestone unit="vullers" n="90"/>
<lb/>Of God, nor any reverence for thy sire ?
<lb/>Is this indeed thy purpose? Slay me not,
<lb/>For in the end my blood will be required.
<lb/>Be not thou reckoned with the murderers,
<lb/>And henceforth thou shalt find no trace of me.
<lb/>Canst thou approve and reconcile these twain—
<lb/>To be a murderer and live thyself?
<lb/>Oh! hurt not e'en the poor grain-dragging ant,
<lb/>For it hath life, and sweet life is a joy.<ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>I will choose some retreat and earn my bread ;
<lb/>Why gird thy loins to take a brother's life ?
<lb/>Why set on fire our agéd father's heart ?
<lb/>Wouldst have the world? Thou hast it. Shed not blood :
<lb/>Provoke not God, the Ruler of the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> heard him speak but answered not a word:
<lb/>His heart was full, his head was vapouring.
<lb/>He drew a dagger from his boot, he robed
<lb/><persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> in blood, and with the keen bright blade
<lb/>Entrenched the royal breast. The lofty Cypress
<lb/>Fell, the imperial girdlestead was broken,
<lb/>The blood ran down that face of cercis-bloom,
<lb/>And thus the young illustrious monarch died!
<lb/><persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> with his dagger cut the prince's head
<lb/>From the elephantine form and all was over.</p>
<p><lb/>O world! since thou hadst nursed him tenderly

<p><lb/>Not who thy secret favourites may be,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>How <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> received Tidings of the Murier of haj</head>
<p><lb/>The eyes of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> were on the road,
<lb/>Both host and crown were longing for the prince ;
<lb/>But when the time arrived for his return
<lb/>How did the tidings reach his father first ?
<lb/>He had prepared the prince a turquoise throne
<lb/>And added jewels to his crown. The people
<lb/>Were all in readiness to welcome him
<lb/>And called for wine and song and minstrelsy.
<lb/>They brought out drums and stately elephants,
<lb/>And put up decorations everywhere
<lb/>Throughout his province. While the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> and troops
<lb/>Were busied thus a cloud of dust appeared,
<lb/>And from its midst a dromedary ridden
<lb/>By one in grief who uttered bitter cries ;
<lb/>He bore a golden casket, and therein
<lb/>The prince's head enwrapped in painted silk.
<lb/>The good man came with woeful countenance
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> and wailed aloud. They raised
<lb/>The golden casket's lid (for every one
<pb n="203"/>
<lb/>Believed the words of him who bore it wild)
<lb/>And taking out the painted silk beheld
<lb/>Within the severed head of prince <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>.
<lb/>Down from his steed fell <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, the troops
<lb/>All rent their clothes, their looks were black, their eyes
<lb/>Blanched with their horror, for the spectacle
<lb/>Was other far than that they hoped to see.
<lb/>Since in this wise the young king came again
<lb/>The troops that went to meet him thus returned—
<lb/>Their banners rent, their kettledruims reversed,
<lb/>The warriors' cheeks like ebony, the tymbals
<milestone unit="vullers" n="92"/>
<lb/>And faces of the elephants all blackened,
<lb/>The prince's <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs></rs> splashed with indigo.
<lb/>Both <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> and warriors fared alike on foot,
<lb/>Their heads all dust ; the paladins in anguish
<lb/>Bewailed that noble man and tore their arms.
<lb/>Be on thy guard as touching this world's love ;
<lb/>A bow is useless if it be not bent.
<lb/>The process of the turning sky above
<lb/>Is, favouring first, to plunder in the event.
<lb/>'Twill countenance an open enemy
<lb/>While those who seek its favour are denied.
<lb/>One goodly counsel I address to thee:
<lb/>Let no love for it in thy heart abide.
<lb/>The troops heart-seared, the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> with cries <q>Alas!
<lb/>Alas!</q> went toward the garden of <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>
<lb/>Where he delighted to hold festival
<lb/>On any royal anniversary.

<lb/>He cried <q>Alas! Alas!</q> plucked out his hair,
<lb/>He poured down tears, he tore his face and girt
<lb/>Around his loins a rope besinirched with blood.
<lb/>He fired the house wherein <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> had dwelt,
<lb/>Destroyed the rose-beds, burnt the cypress-trees
<lb/>And closed up once for all the eye of joy.
<lb/>He placed the prince's head upon his breast,
<lb/>And said with head turned God-ward: <q>Righteous Judge !
<lb/>Look down upon this murdered innocent,
<lb/>Whose severed head is here before me now,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="93"/>
<lb/>Do Thou so burn up those two miscreants' hearts

<p><lb/>He wept thus many days and bitterly.
<lb/>His pillow was the dust, his bed the ground

<lb/>And both those lustrous eyes of his were dimmed.
<lb/>He gave no audience, but without surcease

<p><lb/>A while passed and the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> went in to view
<lb/><persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>'s bower, inspected it and marked
<lb/>The moon-faced beauties who resided there.
<lb/>He saw a slave of lovely countenance,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="94"/>
<lb/>Whose name was Mah Afrid. <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> had loved her,
<lb/>And fate decreed that she should bear him fruit.
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> rejoiced because she was with child,
<lb/>Which gave him hope of vengeance for his son,
<lb/>But when her time was come she bore a daughter,
<lb/>And hope deferred hung heavy on the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>.
<lb/>He nursed the babe with joy and tenderness,
<lb/>And all the folk began to cherish her
<lb/>As she increased in stature and in charms.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said to her the tulip-cheeked :—
<lb/><q>Thou art <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> himself from head to foot.</q>
<lb/>When she was old enough to wed—a Pleiad

<lb/>Her grandsire chose <persName><persName>Pashang</persName></persName> to be her spouse:
<lb/><persName><persName>Pashang</persName></persName> was brother's son to <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,

<lb/>The bearer said: <q>O master of the crown!

<lb/>The world-divider's lips were full of smiles;

<lb/>The slave that carried him upon her breast
<lb/>Trod not the ground, for underneath her feet
<lb/>The purest musk was strewn, and as she walked

<lb/>When <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> had got back sight and heart,

<lb/>And offered homage, showering emeralds

<lb/><q>The throne of king of kings is bright again,</q>
<lb/>They feared their star would sink and sat together

<lb/>And they resolved to send to ask forgiveness.
<lb/>They chose a man persuasive, wise, and modest,
<lb/>To whom they made a passionate appeal,
<lb/>And fearful of a downfall opened wide
<milestone unit="vullers" n="97"/>
<lb/>The treasury of the West. From that old hoard 
<lb/>They chose a crown of gold. They housed the elephants.
<lb/>What wagons did they fill with musk and ambergris,
<lb/>Brocade, dinars, and precious furs and silks!
<lb/>On high-necked elephants the embassage
<lb/>Went from the West in state toward <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>The courtiers added tokens of regard,
<lb/>And when there was as much as heart could wish
<lb/>The envoy came prepared to start. The kings
<lb/>Gave him this embassy to <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Invoking first of all the name of God :—
<lb/><q>May valiant <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> for ever live
<lb/>On whom God hath bestowed the royal <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Be his head flourishing, his person loved,

<lb/>A case committed to me by two slaves
<lb/>At this high portal of the king of kings.
<lb/>Know that two ill-disposed and lawless men,
<lb/>Whose eyes are wet with shame before their sire,
<lb/>Repentant, seared at heart, and much to blame,
<lb/>Now seek how best they may excuse themselves ;
<lb/>Till now they had no hope of being heard.
<pb n="209"/>
<lb/>What do they say ? Their words, wise <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>! are these:—
<lb/><q>Let him that did the evil bear the brunt,
<lb/>And live in pain of heart and self-reproach
<lb/>As we are doing now, O noble <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>!
<lb/>Thus was it written down for us by fate
<lb/>And by decree of fate the sequel came;
<lb/>E'en world-consuming lions and fierce dragons
<lb/>Escape not from the net of destiny.
<lb/>Again—the foul <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Div</rs></rs> bade us put aside
<lb/>All terror of the Worldlord from our hearts,
<lb/>He took possession of two wise men's brains,
<lb/>And mightily prevailed against us both ;
<lb/>And now our hope is that perchance the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>May yet forgive us, and impute the wrong
<lb/>To ignorance in us, next to high heaven
<milestone unit="vullers" n="98"/>
<lb/>That is at once our shelter and our scath,
<lb/>And thirdly to the <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Div</rs></rs> that in our midst
<lb/>Is girded runner-like to work us ill.
<lb/>Now, if the great king's head no longer harboureth
<lb/>Revenge on us, our good faith shall be evident.
<lb/>Let him send <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> and, as an escort,
<lb/>A mighty army to his suppliants,
<lb/>With this intent that we may stand as slaves
<lb/>Before him dutifully ; thus our tears

<lb/>Our offering shall be our tears and groans,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><head>How <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> received his Sons' Message</head>
<p><lb/>Charged with these words, and doubting what would follow,
<lb/>The envoy reached the portal of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>With treasures of all kinds on elephants.
<pb n="210"/>
<lb/>When <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> was told he gave command
<lb/>To spread brocade of <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Ram</rs></rs> upon the throne
<lb/>Of king of kings and have the royal crown
<lb/>Prepared, then took his seat as he had been
<lb/>An upright cypress 'neath a full-orbed moon
<lb/>In fitting state with crown and torque and ear-rings.
<lb/>Blest <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> sat by him crowned, the nobles
<lb/>Stood ranked in double file in robes of gold,
<lb/>With golden mace and girdle, making earth
<lb/>Another sun. On one side pards and lions
<lb/>Were chained, on the other huge war-elephants.
<lb/>Then from the palace issued bold <persName><persName>Shapur</persName></persName>
<lb/>To introduce <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName>'s envoy, who on seeing
<lb/>The palace-gate alighted and ran forward.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="99"/>
<lb/>As soon as he drew near to <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>And saw the diadem and lofty throne,
<lb/>He bent until his visage touched the ground.
<lb/>The noble <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Bade him be seated on a golden seat.
<lb/>He did obeisance to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> and said :—
<lb/><q>O glory of the crown and throne and signet!
<lb/>Thy throne's steps make the earth a rosary,
<lb/>And thy fair fortune brighteneth the age.
<lb/>We serve the dust that is beneath thy feet
<lb/>And only live since thou wilt have it so.</q></p>
<p><lb/>These praises caused the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>'s face to relax,
<lb/>Whereat the envoy spake of clemency
<lb/>With great craft, and the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> gave ear to him
<lb/>While he repeated those two murderers' words,
<lb/>Endeavouring to keep the truth concealed
<lb/>And make excuses for their wickedness,
<lb/>Inviting <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> to visit them
<lb/>When they would wait upon him as his slaves,
<lb/>Give him the crown and throne of majesty
<pb n="211"/>
<lb/>And purchase back from him <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>'s blood
<lb/>With wealth, brocade, dinars, and jewelry.
<lb/>The monarch heard the speech and answered it ;
<lb/>Like key to lock so did the answer fit.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><head>How <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> made Answer to his Sons</head>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, when he had heard the message sent
<lb/>By his two wicked sons, said to the envoy :—
<lb/><q>Canst thou conceal the sun, and clearer still
<lb/>Are shown the secrets of those miscreants' hearts ?
<lb/>I have heard all thy words; now mark mine answer.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="100"/>
<lb/>Tell those two shameless and unholy men,
<lb/>Unrighteous, ill-affectioned, and impure,
<lb/>That their vain words avail them not, and I
<lb/>Have also something that I fain would say :—
<lb/><q>If thus your love for <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> hath grown
<lb/>Where is the body of his famous sire—
<lb/><persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>? The maw of wild beasts hideth it,
<lb/>His head is in a narrow casket laid,
<lb/>And they who made a riddance of <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>
<lb/>Now seek to shed the blood of <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>!
<lb/>Ye shall not see his face but with an army
<lb/>And with a casque of steel upon his head,
<lb/>With mace and Kawian standard while the earth
<lb/>Is darkened by his horses' trampling hoofs ;
<lb/>With leaders like <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, who loveth fight,
<lb/>Shaptir—the valiant backbone of the host—
<lb/>And by his side <persName><persName>Shidush</persName></persName> the warrior,
<lb/><persName><persName>Shirwi</persName></persName> the lion-strong as pioneer,
<lb/>King <persName><persName>Taliman</persName></persName>, and <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName>, king of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>To head the forces and direct the war;
<lb/>And we will drench with blood, both leaf and fruit,
<lb/>The tree sprung out of vengeance for <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>.
<pb n="212"/>
<lb/>No one hath sought revenge for him as yet
<lb/>Because I saw the back of fortune bent:
<lb/>It seemed not good to me to lay my hands
<lb/>In battle on mine own two sons; but now
<lb/>From that same Tree which enemies have felled
<lb/>A fruitful Offshoot hath sprung up; for like
<lb/>An angry lion <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> shall come,
<lb/>With loins girt ready to avenge his sire,
<lb/>Together with the leaders of the troops—

<lb/><persName><persName>Garshasp</persName></persName>, son of <persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName>—and hosts to reach

<lb/>Next for their pleading that <q>the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> must wash
<lb/>His heart from vengeance, and forgive our crime,
<lb/>Because the sky so turned o'er us that wisdom
<lb/>Was troubled, and affection's seat obscured :</q>
<lb/>I have heard all the unavailing plea,
<lb/>And now that patience is fordone I answer :—
<lb/><q>No man that soweth seed of violence
<lb/>Shall see good days or jocund Paradise.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="101"/>
<lb/>If ye are pardoned by All-holy God
<lb/>What need ye fear about a brother's blood ?
<lb/>The wise esteem the self-excuser guilty.
<lb/>Revere ye not the glorious Lord of all ?
<lb/>Your hearts are black, your tongues speak glozing words ;
<lb/>He will requite you for it in both worlds.
<lb/>And thirdly, since ye sent an ivory throne
<lb/>And torquoise crown on mighty elephants,
<lb/>With purses full of divers-coloured gems,
<lb/>Am I to balk revenge, to wash away
<lb/>The blood and sell the prince's head for gold ?
<lb/>Nay! perish first throne, diadem, and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>!
<lb/>Worse than a dragon's offspring is the man
<lb/>Who taketh money for a priceless head.
<pb n="213"/>
<lb/>Shall any say: <q>The sire in his old age
<lb/>Is putting price upon his son's dear life ?</q>
<lb/>As for these gifts of yours—I need them not.
<lb/>But wherefore utter I so many words ?
<lb/>Your hoary-headed sire will not ungird
<lb/>The loins of his revenge while life endureth.</q>
<lb/>Thy message have I heard. Hear my reply,
<lb/>Retain it every whit and get thee gone.</q>
<lb/>The messenger grew pale at this dread speech
<lb/>And at the bearing of prince <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Leapt up in fear and mounted instantly.
<lb/>The noble, youthful envoy shrewdly saw :—

<p><lb/>He sped
<lb/>Like rushing wind, his head full of the message,
<lb/>His heart of bodings. When he saw the West,
<lb/>With camp-enclosures stretched upon the plain,
<lb/>He made his way toward <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName>'s pavilion
<milestone unit="vullers" n="102"/>
<lb/>Of painted silk with other tents around,
<lb/>Where sat both kings in conclave. Word was passed :—

<p><lb/>The chamberlain
<lb/>Approached and took him to the royal presence.
<lb/>They had a special seat prepared for him

<lb/>And of the aspect of the turning sky :—
<lb/><q>What favour showeth it to <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> ?
<lb/>Who are the nobles? Who is minister ?
<lb/>What treasures have they? Who hath charge thereof ?</q>
<lb/>The envoy said: <q>The portal of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>Beholdeth that which bright spring seeth not,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="103"/>
<pb n="214"/>
<lb/>For 'tis the jocund Spring of Paradise
<lb/>Where ground is ambergris and bricks are gold.
<lb/>The roof above his palace is a heaven,
<lb/>And Paradise is in his smiling face.
<lb/>When I approached his lofty residence
<lb/>Its roof was telling secrets to the stars.
<lb/>On this hand there were lions, and on that
<lb/>Were elephants. The world itself was placed
<lb/>Beneath his throne. Upon his elephants
<lb/>Were seats of gold, and round the lions' necks
<lb/>Were jewelled torques. The tymbal-players stood
<lb/>Before the elephants while trumpets blared.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The precincts seethe, earth shouteth
<lb/>To heaven,</q> I came before that well-loved <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>And saw a lofty turquoise throne where sat
<lb/>A monarch hke a moon. Upon his head
<lb/>He wore a sparkling ruby coronet.
<lb/>His hair was white as camphor, and his cheeks
<lb/>Were like the petals of the rose. His heart
<lb/>Is full of clemency, his speech is kind ;
<lb/>He is the hope and fear of all the world.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q><persName><persName>Jamshid</persName></persName> doth live again.</q>
<lb/>A Shoot from that tall Cypress—<persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Like <persName><persName>Tahmuras</persName></persName>, the Binder of the <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Div</rs></rs>,

<lb/><q>He is the heart and soul of that great <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>.</q>
<lb/>There <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName> stood, the skilled among the smiths,
<lb/>With one before him well beseen in war—
<lb/>His son, <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> by name, the warrior,
<lb/>The watchful chief, the conqueror of hosts ;
<lb/>The minister—<persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName>, monarch of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>The treasurer—victorious <persName><persName>Garshasp</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Were there. The sum within the treasuries
<lb/>Appeareth not. None ever saw such greatness.
<pb n="215"/>
<lb/>Around the palace were two lines of troops
<lb/>With golden maces and with golden helms.
<lb/>Before them there were leaders like <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName>, that experienced captain,
<lb/>And warriors—ravening Lions like <persName><persName>Shirwi</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And bold <persName><persName>Shapur</persName></persName>, the elephantine chief.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="104"/>
<lb/>When on the elephants they bind the drums
<lb/>The air becometh ebon with the dust.
<lb/>If these men come to fight us hill and plain
<lb/>Will be confounded ; these men have revenge
<lb/>At heart; their faces frown; they purpose war.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The envoy having further told the message
<lb/>Of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>, those tyrants' hearts grew sore,
<lb/>Their faces blue as lapislazull.
<lb/>They sat consulting, but had naught determined
<lb/>When <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> spake thus: <q>Farewell to peace and joy!
<lb/>We must not let this hardy lion's whelp
<lb/>Grow bold and sharp of fang. Will such a youth

<lb/>When grandson communeth with grandsire thus
<lb/>Some devilry is sure to come of it.
<lb/>Prepare we then for war and that with speed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They hurried out their cavalry and mustered
<lb/>Troops from the West and <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>, whence hubbub rose
<lb/>And all flocked to the kings—a multitude
<lb/>Whose star of fortune was no longer young.

<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> was told, <q>A host hath crossed <placeName><placeName>Jihun</placeName></placeName>,</q>
<lb/>And bade prince <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> to pass the frontier
<milestone unit="vullers" n="105"/>
<pb n="216"/>
<lb/>Toward the desert, thus advising him :—
<lb/><q>A youth predestined to be fortunate
<lb/>May happen to ensnare a mountain-sheep
<lb/>While hunters are before and pards behind ;
<lb/>But having patience, prudence, sense, and wits,
<lb/>He will take savage lions in his toils,
<lb/>And now my fves in these my closing days
<lb/>I would chastise, and wield a sword of fire.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Great <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>!</q> said <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, <q>may fate keep ill
<lb/>For any foe that cometh to attack thee;
<lb/>May he betray himself both soul and body.
<lb/>Lo! I will don a coat of Riman mail
<lb/>To leave no part exposed, and then in quest
<lb/>Of vengeance on the battlefield will send
<lb/>The dust of yon host sunward. None of them
<lb/>Hold I a man: dare they contend with me?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He ordered that <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, who loved the fray,
<lb/>Should cross the frontier to the desert, taking
<lb/>The camp-enclosure and the imperial standard.
<lb/>Then as troop followed troop the hills and plains
<lb/>Heaved like the sea, the day was dark with dust,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>The sun is azure-dim.</q>
<lb/>A clamour rose enough to deafen ears
<lb/>Though keen, the neighing of the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> steeds
<lb/>Rose high above the tymbals' din. Two lines
<lb/>Of mighty elephants stretched from the camp
<lb/>For two miles, sixty carried seats of gold
<lb/>Inlaid with gems, three hundred bore the baggage,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="106"/>
<lb/>Three hundred were in iron panoply
<lb/>That hid all but their eyes.</p>
<p><lb/>They left <placeName><placeName>Tammisha</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>And bore the camp-enclosure to the waste.
<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> the avenger was the general,

<lb/>The men of name marched mailed, with massive maces,
<pb n="217"/>
<lb/>All bold as angry lions and all girded
<lb/>For vengeance for <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> ; their steel-blue swords

<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, went from the forest of <placeName><placeName>Narwan</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Reviewed and ranged his host on those broad plains.
<lb/>He gave the army's left wing to <persName><persName>Garshasp</persName></persName> ;
<lb/>Upon the right was brave <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> with <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who set the battle in array. The prince
<lb/>With <persName><persName>Sarv</persName></persName> was in the centre, whence he shone
<lb/>Moon-like, or as the sun o'er some high hill.
<lb/>Led by <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, with champions such as <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> army fought. <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName> was scout,
<lb/>The heroes of the house of <persName><persName>Taliman</persName></persName>
<lb/>Were ambuscaders, and the host was decked
<lb/>In bridal trim with lion-warriors
<lb/>And din of drums.</p>
<p><lb/>Men bore the news in haste

<p><lb/>That pair of murderers with a huge array
<lb/>Set forth intent on vengeance and drew up

<lb/>While blest <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName> went back to <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>
<lb/>And told the insulting words. The young prince laughed.
<lb/><q>None but a fool,</q> he said, <q>would talk like this.
<lb/>But praise to Him—the Lord of both the worlds—
<lb/>Who knoweth all things secret or revealed !
<lb/>He knoweth that my grandsire was <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>,
<lb/>As blessed <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> assureth me,

<lb/>Gird up your loins, be vigilant, and may

<lb/>Take up your stations and preserve your ranks.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The captains of the host, the valiant chiefs,

<p><lb/>They went back to their tents,

<p><lb/>Now when day broke,
<lb/>Upheaving night's mid gloom, the prince assumed
<lb/>His station at the centre of the host
<lb/>With coat of armour, sword, and Riman helm.
<lb/>The soldiers shouted lifting to the clouds
<lb/>Their spears. He duly ordered all the troops,
<lb/>The left, the right, the centre, and the wings.
<lb/>With heads all anger and with brows all frowns
<lb/>They rolled up earth in marching. It resembled

<lb/><q>It sinketh fast!</q> From his huge elephant
<lb/>He dropped a ball, earth heaved like azure sea,

<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>It is a festival.</q>
<pb n="220"/>
<lb/>The troops moved mountain-like and both hosts shouted.
<lb/>Anon the plain ran blood: thou wouldst have said

<milestone unit="vullers" n="110"/>
<lb/>They fought till night, till <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, who won
<lb/>The love of all, obtained the victory ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="111"/>
<lb/>Yet fortune in one stay abideth not,
<lb/>Now honey and now gall make up man's lot.</p>
<p><lb/>The hearts of <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> were deeply moved
<lb/>By grief. They listened for a night-surprise,
<lb/>But no one came e'en when night turned to day,
<lb/>And they themselves were anxious for delay.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><head>How <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> was Slain by the Hand of Menichihr</head>
<p><lb/>Noon passed. With vengeful hearts the brothers met
<lb/>For consultation ; mid their foolish schemes
<lb/>They said: <q>Let us attempt a night-attack
<lb/>And fill the desert and the plain with blood.</q>
<lb/>That night those miscreants drew their army out,
<lb/>Bent on a camisade. The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> scouts
<lb/>Gat news thereof, and sped to <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>
<lb/>To tell him so that he might post his troops.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="112"/>
<lb/>That shrewd man heard and planned a counter-ruse.
<lb/>He left <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> the host and led himself
<lb/>An ambuscade with thirty thousand warriors,
<lb/>All men of name. <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> came at night and brought
<lb/>One hundred thousand men prepared for fight,
<lb/>But found the foe arrayed with banners flying
<lb/>And saw that battle was his sole resource.
<lb/>A shout rose from the centres of the hosts,
<lb/>The horsemen made the air a cloud of dust
<lb/>And steel swords flashed like lightning: thou hadst said :—
<pb n="221"/>
<lb/><q>They make air blaze, earth gleam like diamonds.</q>
<lb/>The clashing of the steel went through the brain,
<lb/>While flame and blast rose cloudward. <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>
<lb/>Sprang from his ambush and surrounded <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="113"/>
<lb/>Who wheeled and fled mid wailings of despair
<lb/>From his own troops. Prince <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> pursued,
<lb/>Hot for revenge, and cried: <q>Stay, miscreant,
<lb/>Who lovest fight so well and cuttest off
<lb/>The heads of innocents! Know'st not that all
<lb/>Desire revenge on thee ?</q> 
<lb/>He hurled a dart
<lb/>Against <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>'s back, whose sword fell from his grasp.
<lb/>Then <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> like wind unseated him,
<lb/>Cast him to earth, slew him, cut off his head,
<lb/>And left the body for the beasts of prey;
<lb/>Then went back to his camp to contemplate

<lb/>About the war—its fortunes good and ill—
<lb/>And first he spake of Him who made the world—

<lb/><q>Praise to the Worldlord who hath succoured us! 
<lb/>Men find no other helper in their straits.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="114"/>
<lb/>He is the Guide, he maketh hearts rejoice

<lb/>His fortune is the source of righteousness,

<lb/>By virtue of thy <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> I reached <placeName><placeName>Turan</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Arrayed the host and fought by day and night
<lb/>Thrice fiercely in two days. I heard that <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>
<lb/>Designed a night-attack and wanting power
<lb/>Relied on craft; so I arranged an ambush
<lb/>And left him nothing but the wind to clutch.
<lb/>He fled, I followed, and o'ertaking him
<lb/>Pierced through his armour with a javelin,
<lb/>And took him from his saddle like the wind.
<lb/>I flung him as I would a serpent down
<lb/>And from his worthless body smote the head,
<lb/>Which lo! I send my grandsire, and forthwith
<lb/>Will set about a stratagem for <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName>.
<lb/>Since <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> had placed within a golden casket
<lb/>His royal brother's head in foul contempt,
<lb/>And had no ruth or reverence for him, God,
<lb/>Who made the world, delivered <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> to me,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="115"/>
<lb/>And I have slain him as he slew <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName> ;
<lb/>And will lay waste his realm and dwelling-place.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The letter done he sent a cameleer,
<lb/>Who sped like wind with cheeks suffused with shame
<lb/>And hot tears in his eyes for <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> ;
<lb/>How should he like to be the carrier
<lb/>Of <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>'s head to the monarch of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> ?
<lb/>Though dead sons were perverse their fathers mourn them ;
<lb/>But as the crime was great and unprovoked,
<lb/>And as the avenger was both young and brave,
<lb/>The messenger approached with confidence
<lb/>And laid the head of <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> before the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Who prayed to God, the righteous Judge, to pour

<lb/>Upon a lofty castle in his rear ;
<lb/>Such are the ups and downs which fortune hath!
<lb/>Now <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> had thought of this and said :—
<lb/><q>If <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> declineth battle his retreat
<milestone unit="vullers" n="116"/>
<lb/>Will be upon the hold of the Alans,
<lb/>And therefore we must occupy the road,
<lb/>For if he hath the fortress of the sea
<lb/>No one will wrench him from his foothold there.
<lb/>It is a place whose head is in the clouds,
<lb/>'Twas built by cunning from the ocean's depths,
<lb/>Is furnished well with treasures manifold
<lb/>And overshadowed by the eagle's wing.
<lb/>I must make haste to execute my plan
<lb/>And ply both rein and stirrup.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This he told
<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, who, as he knew, would keep the secret.
<lb/>That chief replied: <q>O gracious sovereign !
<lb/>If to the least of all his warriors
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> vouchsafeth to entrust a host,
<lb/>I will secure <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName>'s only gate for combat
<lb/>Or for retreat. For this exploit I need
<lb/>Twur's royal standard and his signet-ring,
<lb/>Then will I make a shift to seize the hold
<lb/>And go to-night; but keep the matter close.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He chose six thousand veterans of name,
<lb/>Who when the sky grew ebon placed the drums
<lb/>Upon the elephants, and full of fight
<lb/>Set forward toward the sea. <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> resigned
<lb/>The army to <persName><persName>Shirwi</persName></persName> and said: <q>I go
<pb n="224"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="117"/>
<lb/>Disguised as envoy to the castellan 
<lb/>To show to him the signet-ring of <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>.
<lb/>When I am in the castle I will raise
<lb/>The standard, and will make the blue swords gleam.
<lb/>Approach ye then the hold, and when I shout
<lb/>Make onset and lay on.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He left the host
<lb/>Hard by the hold while he himself advanced,
<lb/>And when he reached the castle told his tale,
<lb/>Showed to the castellan Tuz's signet-ring
<lb/>And said: <q>I come from <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>, who bade me not
<lb/>Stop to draw breath, and said: <q>Go to the castellan
<lb/>And say to him: <q>Be watchful day and night,
<lb/>Share both in weal and woe, guard well the castle,
<lb/>Be vigilant, and if <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>
<lb/>Shall send his troops and standard 'gainst the hold
<lb/>Assist each other, and put forth your strength ;
<lb/>And may ye overthrow the enemy.</q> </q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The castellan heard this and recognised
<lb/>The signet-ring ; they oped the castle-gates :
<lb/>He saw the seeming, but he saw no more.
<lb/><rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs></rs> here the rustic poet's moralising :—

<lb/>To labour at the duty of the day;
<lb/>So be the good and evil what they may,
<lb/>Mine only duty is to say my say.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The castellan re-entered with <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who loved the fight, the guileless with the guileful.
<lb/>This chieftain, though prepared for stratagems,
<lb/>Sealed friendship with a stranger, and in folly
<lb/>Gave both his head and castle to the winds.
<lb/>He thus addressed his son—a warrior-pard :—
<lb/><q>My son, who art so skilful and adroit !
<milestone unit="vullers" n="118"/>
<lb/>Do nothing rashly and in ignorance,
<pb n="225"/>
<lb/>But ponder well and mark froin first to last
<lb/>The honied words of one that is a stranger,
<lb/>Especially in times of war and strife.
<lb/>Search well and live in dread of ambuscades,
<lb/>Look deeply whatsoe'er the matter be,
<lb/>And how a chieftain shrewd of intellect,
<lb/>By leaving some small detail unexplored,
<lb/>And not considering the foemen's craft,
<lb/>May render up his fortress to the winds.</q>
<lb/>At break of day <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, who loved the fight,
<lb/>Set up a standard like the moon full-orbed ;
<lb/>He shouted and made signals to <persName><persName>Shirwi</persName></persName>
<lb/>And his exalted chiefs. <persName><persName>Shirwi</persName></persName> perceiving
<lb/>The royal standard made toward the hold,
<lb/>Seized on the gate, threw in his troops and crowned

<lb/><persName><persName>Shirwi</persName></persName>, the sword above, the sea below.
<lb/>By noon the castle's form and castellan's
<lb/>Had vanished. Thou couldst see a cloud of smoke,
<lb/>But ship and castle were invisible.
<lb/>Fire blazed, wind blew, rose horsemen's shouts and cries

<lb/>I have not reached him in the combat yet,

<p><lb/>As thus he spake he urged his steed along

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName>'s troops were scattered like a flock by snow

<lb/>Among us there are some possessed of herds,

—period of the poem. We have already seen how the titles bestowed on the great hero <persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> became separate personalities in later times,<ref target="n.2"/> and in this reign we have one of his most

<pb n="235"/> famous feats recorded as an exploit of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, the son of <persName><persName>Nariman</persName></persName>—the slaying of the dragon of the Kashaf. The legend appears to have become localised in the neighbourhood of the poet's own birthplace, <persName><persName>Tus</persName></persName>, by which the Kashaf flows, and the dragon may be typical of the periodical floods the prevention of which is said to have been an object which the poet had at heart.<ref target="n.1"/>. The feature of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s mace is reproduced from the earlier legend, where
<persName><persName>Keresaspa</persName></persName> is described as <q>bludgeon-bearing.</q> <ref target="n.2"/>
The gigantic mythical bird, the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs>, the Roc of the
Arabian Nights, which plays such an important part in the legend of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and of his son <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, is described in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs> as
<q>the griffon of three natures.</q>?<ref target="n.3"/> It appears to have been conceived of as a sort of gigantic bat.<ref target="n.4"/> The <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs>, in its account of birds, says: <q>There are two of them which have milk in the teat and suckle their young, the griffon bird, and the bat which flies in the night; as they say that the bat is created of three races (sardak), the race (ayina) of the dog, the bird, and the musk. anvmal ; for it flies hke a bird, has many teeth like a dog, and is dwelling in holes like a musk-rat.</q><ref target="n.5"/> The <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> was the first bird created,<ref target="n.6"/> and its nest was on the tree of wild vegetable life which grew in the wide ocean near to the tree of immortality. Upon the former tree collect all the seeds which plants have produced during the year, and the office of the
<rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> was to shake the tree and scatter the seeds, which were then collected by another mythical bird, called Chamrosh, which had its nest on the summit of <placeName><placeName>Mount Alburz</placeName></placeName> and protected <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> from invasion. This bird mingled the seeds with the rains, which the good genius Tishtar (Sirius) had rescued from the demons, with a view of pouring them on the earth; the purport of the legend was to account for the rapid vegetation in hot climates.<ref target="n.7"/>
The poet appears to have combined some of the characteristics of several mythical birds—the Chamrosh, the Karshipta, and also of the Varengana or raven in his account of the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs>. The magical or medicinal efficacy of the raven's feathers is recognised in the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs></rs>, where we read: <q>Zarathustra asked Ahura
Mazda... ‘If I have a curse thrown upon me, a spell told upon me by many men who hate me, what is the remedy for it?’ Ahura

The feather of that bird of birds brings him help; it brings unto him the homage of men, it maintains him in his glory.</q> <ref target="n.1"/></p>
<p>With regard to the account of the employment of anesthetics on the occasion of the Cesarean birth of <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, we find another instance of their employment by <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> himself in the account of the Creation in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Bundahish</rs></rs>. When <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> broke into the creation of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs></rs> and attacked the Primeval Ox, we read that

Genesis that the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam.</p>
<p>The earliest reference to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> in literature appears to be an indirect one in the Kur'an.’<ref target="n.3"/> He is also mentioned in the work that passes under the name of Moses of Chorene: <q>Age vero, si placet, vilia vanaque de eo mendacia declarabo, qualia

The ascent is nearly three miles ; for the last five or six hundred
yards the summit is so difficult of approach that the slightest
opposition, if well directed, must render it impregnable... In 1810
it was ,.. in possession of the tribe of Mumasenni, one of the
aboriginal tribes of <placeName><placeName>Persia</placeName></placeName>. Their means of defence were probably
still the same as in the days of Roostum: a line of large stones
ranged in regular order around the edges of the precipice. Each
stone is wedged in by a smaller: when that is removed, the
large stone, or rather rock, is hurled down, and sweeps everything before it.</q> <ref target="n.1"/></p>

<lb/>Uplifteth in the pride of wealth his head,
<lb/>Or causeth sorrow to the suffering,
<lb/>All such are infidels in my regard
<lb/>And worse than evil-doing <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>.
<lb/>All evil-doers that hold not the Faith
<lb/>Are banned by God and us: hereafter we
<lb/>Will put our hand upon the scimitar,
<lb/>And in our vengeance desolate their realm.</q></p>
<p><lb/>All men of name throughout the earth invoked
<lb/>Their blessings on him with one voice, and said :—
<lb/><q>Thy glorious grandsire, O benignant <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>!
<lb/>Taught thee the conduct of the throne and crown.
<lb/>Be ever thine the throne of mighty men,
<lb/>The crown and archimages' <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>. Our hearts
<lb/>Obey thy word, our souls are pledged to thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thereat rose <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, the chief of paladins,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="131"/>
<lb/>And said to <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>: <q>O judge most just!
<lb/>I from the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shahs</rs></rs> have gotten eyes to see,
<lb/>And see thee just: my part is to applaud.
<pb n="239"/>
<lb/><rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> art thou by long descent—
<lb/>The chosen of the Lions and the brave.
<lb/>May God watch o'er thy body and thy soul,
<lb/>Thy heart be glad, thy fortune slurnber not.
<lb/>Thou mindest me of days of yore and art
<lb/>My place of shelter at the royal throne.
<lb/>Thou art a lion steadfast in the fight,
<lb/>Thou art a sun resplendent in the feast.
<lb/>Be time and earth the dust upon thy feet,
<lb/>Thy place upon the turquoise throne. Since thou
<lb/>Hast cleansed earth with thine <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> scimitar
<lb/>Sit at thine ease and take thy pleasure here.
<lb/>Henceforward all the warfare is for us;
<lb/>Thine are the throne, the wine-cup, and the banquet.
<lb/>The fathers of my race were paladins—
<lb/>The shelter of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shahs</rs></rs> and of the great—
<lb/>And from <persName><persName>Garshasp</persName></persName> to famous <persName><persName>Nariman</persName></persName>
<lb/>Were chiefs and swordsmen. I will compass earth
<lb/>And put a scantling of thy foes in bonds.
<lb/>Thy grandsire made me paladin, thy love
<lb/>And counsel made me wise.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> returned
<lb/>His praise, bestowing many a kingly gift,
<lb/>And then <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> with the paladins withdrew
<lb/>And so departed on his homeward way,
<lb/>While all the world conformed to righteous sway.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>The Birth of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>Now will I fashion from the legend-store
<lb/>A tale of wonder from the days of yore;
<lb/>Give me thine ear, my son! and learn from me
<lb/>How <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> became the sport of destiny.
<pb n="240"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="132"/>
<lb/>Now <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> was childless and in that regard
<lb/>In need of solace. One among his wives—
<lb/>A Beauty rosy-cheeked with musky hair—
<lb/>Gave him the hope of offspring, for that Moon
<lb/>Was sun-faced, ripe, and was with child by him,
<lb/>And grievously she suffered with her burden.
<lb/>When many days had passed the babe was born—
<lb/>A Beauty like the world-illuming sun,
<lb/>And like it too in loveliness of face ;
<lb/>But all his hair was white, and since 'twas so
<lb/>They kept the thing from <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> for one whole week:
<lb/>The women of that famous paladin
<lb/>Wept in the presence of the little child,
<lb/>But not one dared to tell the hero <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>That his fair spouse had borne a hoary babe..
<lb/>Anon the infant's nurse, with lion's courage,
<lb/>Came unabashed before the paladin,
<lb/>As one who brought good news, blessed him and said :—
<lb/><q>May <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the hero's days be fortunate,
<lb/>And may his foemen's hearts be rooted out!
<lb/>God hath bestowed on thee what thou didst ask—
<lb/>The very gift whereon thy soul was set:
<lb/>Behind thy curtain, seeker after glory !
<lb/>Thy moon-faced spouse hath borne a stainless son,
<lb/>A paladin, a child of lion-heart,
<lb/>A boy of spirit, fashioned of pure silver,
<lb/>And with two cheeks that favour Paradise.
<lb/>Thou wilt not see a faulty part in him
<lb/>Except this blemish—that his hair is white.
<lb/>So heaven willed, O seeker after glory!
<lb/>Content thee and be not morose and thankless.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The horseman <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> descended from his throne;
<lb/>He went behind the curtain to <q>Young Spring,</q>
<lb/>And saw a goodly boy with hoary head.
<pb n="241"/>
<lb/>None hath beheld or heard of such; his hair
<milestone unit="vullers" n="133"/>
<lb/>Resembled snow and yet his cheeks were ruddy.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> at that sight despaired. Great was his fear
<lb/>Of coming shame; he left the path of wisdom
<lb/>For courses of his own, looked up to heaven
<lb/>And prayed to be forgiven his offence.</p>
<p><lb/><q>O Thou,</q> he said, <q>above all harm and loss!
<lb/>Good ever cometh of Thine ordinance.
<lb/>If I have sinned by any grievous sin,
<lb/>Or yielded to the faith of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Oh! may the Almighty hearken to my prayer
<lb/>And in His secret counsels pardon me.
<lb/>My troubled mind is writhing for sheer shame,
<lb/>The hot blood is a-tingle in my veins
<lb/>For this brat like a brat of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>,
<lb/>With dark eyes and with hair like jessamine.
<lb/>When any nobles come to speak with me,
<lb/>And set their eyes on this ill-omened cub,
<lb/>What shall I say that this div's bantling is—
<lb/>A fay or leopard with its spots? The great
<lb/>Will laugh at me in public and in private
<lb/>Till shame shall make me curse and quit <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>.</q>
<lb/>He spake in wrath with frowns and railed at fortune,
<lb/>Then bade some take the child and carry it
<lb/>Beyond those fields and fells and far away.
» There was a certain mountain named <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Nigh to the sun and far removed from men,
<lb/>Where the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> had nested, for the place
<lb/>Was uninhabited. They left the child
<lb/>Upon the mountain and returned. Time passed,
<lb/>While for no fault the infant paladin,
<lb/>Unable to distinguish black from white,
<lb/>Was outcast from his father's love; but He,
<lb/>Who fostereth all, took up the castaway.
<pb n="242"/></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="134"/>
<p><lb/>Once when the lioness her cub had fed,
<lb/><q>If I should give thee my heart's blood,</q> she said,
<lb/><q>I should not look for thanks. I live in thee;
<lb/>My heart would break if thou shouldst break with me.</q>
<lb/>Throughout the expanse of earth the beasts we find
<lb/>More tender to their young than are mankind.</p>
<p><lb/>The babe remained where thrown, exposed both day
<lb/>And night. He sucked his finger-ends and wailed.
<lb/>Now when the young Simurghs grew ravenous
<lb/>The mother, soaring o'er her nest, beheld
<lb/>Earth like a heaving sea, and wailing there
<lb/>A child rock-cradled with the dust for nurse,
<lb/>His body bare, his lips unwet with milk,
<lb/>The dark drear soil about him and above
<lb/>The noonday sun. Would that he had had pards
<lb/>For dam and sire, he had at least been shaded!
<lb/>The Lord gave loving instincts to that fowl,
<lb/>Which thought not to devour the child herself,
<lb/>But swooped down from the clouds and with her talons
<lb/>Took up the infant from the heated rocks,
<lb/>Then bare him quickly off to <placeName><placeName>Mount Alburz</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Where were her nest and young, for them to tear
<lb/>Regardless of his cries; but God, who giveth
<lb/>All good, had ruth on him, his lot was other ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="135"/>
<lb/>For when the fowl and all her brood beheld
<lb/>That infant, who was weeping tears of blood,
<lb/>They lavished love on him in wondrous wise,
<lb/>Astonied at his goodly face. The bird
<lb/>Chose for him all the tenderest prey, and made
<lb/>Her little guest suck blood instead of milk.
<lb/>Long was he lost to sight; but when he came
<lb/>To man's estate a caravan passed by
<lb/>And saw one like a noble cypress-tree,
<lb/>His breast a silver mount, his waist a reed,
<pb n="243"/>
<lb/>And rumour of him spread, for neither good
<lb/>Nor bad remaineth hid; so <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> in fine
<lb/>Heard of that high-starred youth of <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> divine.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> had a Dream touching the Case of his Son</head>
<p><lb/>One night when <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> was sleeping, seared in heart
<lb/>And overwhelmed by that which time had wrought,
<lb/>He dreamed that from the land of <placeName><placeName>Ind</placeName></placeName> there came
<lb/>A noble rider on an <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> steed
<lb/>Apace, and gave him glad news of his son—
<lb/>That lofty bough of his of fruitful promise.
<lb/>When he awoke he called the archimages,
<lb/>Conversed with them at large, told them his dream
<lb/>And of the gossip of the caravans:
<lb/><q>What say ye,</q> said he, <q>touching this affair ?
<lb/>Is ita fair presumption to your minds
<lb/>That this child liveth, or hath winter's cold
<lb/>Or summer's heat destroyed him ?</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="136"/>
<p><lb/>Old and young 
<lb/>There present answered thus the paladin :—
<lb/><q>Ingrates to God experience good in naught ;
<lb/>For pards and lions on the sands and rocks,
<lb/>And fish and crocodiles in waterways,
<lb/>All cherish their own little ones and give
<lb/>God thanks; but thou didst break the covenant
<lb/>With Him who giveth good, and cast away
<lb/>An innocent because of his white hair,
<lb/>Which shameth not a body pure and bright.
<lb/>Say not, <q>The child is dead,</q> but gird thyself
<lb/>And ever persevere in quest of him,
<lb/>Since one whom God regardeth will not die
<lb/>Of heat or cold. And now in penitence
<pb n="244"/>
<lb/>Incline to Him—the Author of all good,
<lb/>The Guide.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So next day and in sore distress
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> went to <placeName><placeName>Mount Alburz</placeName></placeName>, and when night came
<lb/>Slept ill at ease. He saw a standard raised
<lb/>Above the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> mountains, and a youth
<lb/>Of beauteous visage with a mighty host,
<lb/>Upon his left an archmage, on his right
<lb/>A sage of noble aspect. Of these twain
<lb/>One came to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> and said in chilling tones :—
<lb/><q>Audacious man and impious in thine aims!
<lb/>Is there no fear of God before thine eyes ?
<lb/>If to thy mind a bird is nurse enough
<lb/>What booteth it to be a paladin ?
<lb/>If white hair be a blemish in a man
<lb/>Thy beard and head have grown like willow-leaves !
<milestone unit="vullers" n="137"/>
<lb/>God gave thee such and such things: why hast thou
<lb/>By thine injustice frustrated the gift ?
<lb/>Abhor thy Maker then, for day by day
<lb/>Thy body changeth hue. Thou didst despise
<lb/>Thy son, who is the fosterling of God—
<lb/>The kindliest Nurse for him. As for thyself,
<lb/>Love is not in thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> roared out in sleep
<lb/>As when a mighty lion is ensnared ;
<lb/>He feared that dream portended chastisement
<lb/>From destiny. Aroused, he called to him
<lb/>The men of lore and bade the chiefs to horse.
<lb/>He came in haste toward the mountain-peak
<lb/>To seek his castaway, and there beheld
<lb/>A height whose top was midst the Pleiades:
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>It will obstruct the stars.</q>
<lb/>Upon the top was built a lofty nest,
<lb/>Where <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs></rs>'s influence could not injure it ;
<pb n="245"/>
<lb/>Tall posts of ebony and sandal-wood
<lb/>Laced with lign-aloe stayed it underneath.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> gazed in wonder on that stony peak,
<lb/>On that majestic bird and weird abode.
<lb/>The building reached to Spica, and was raised
<lb/>Without hand-labour, with no stones and earth.
<lb/>A youth stood there—the counterpart of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who watched him as he walked about the nest,
<lb/>Then laid his cheeks upon the ground, and gave
<lb/>Thanks to the Maker, in that He had made
<lb/>Such bird upon the mountain, and had raised
<lb/>Its stony summit to the Pleiades,
<lb/>Acknowledging: <q>He is a righteous Judge,
<lb/>All powerful and higher than the high.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He sought to find a path or any track
<lb/>Whereby the wild beasts scaled the precipice ;
<lb/>And walked around the mountain giving thanks,
<lb/>But saw no way to climb it. He exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>O Thou above all place, o'er sun and moon
<milestone unit="vullers" n="138"/>
<lb/>And shining rainbow! I prostrate myself
<lb/>Before Thee, pouring out my soul in awe.
<lb/>If this youth springeth from my loins indeed,
<lb/>Not from the seed of evil <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Assist thy servant to ascend this height
<lb/>And show me mercy, sinful as I am.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus prayed he to the Just: his prayer was granted.
<lb/>When the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> looked from the height and saw
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> with his company, she knew that they
<lb/>Came not for love of her but for the youth,
<lb/>To whom she said: <q>Thou who bast seen the unease
<lb/>Of nide and nest! Iam the only nurse
<lb/>That fostered thee, the source of all thy weal,
<lb/>And gave to thee the name Dastan-i-Zand,<ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>Because thy sire dealt with thee treacherously ;
<note n="1">I.e. <gloss>much defrauded</gloss>, in allusion to Sim's treatment of his son.</note>
<pb n="246"/>
<lb/>Command thy valiant guide to call thee so
<lb/>When thou returnest home. Thy sire is <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The hero, paladin of paladins,
<lb/>And most exalted of the mighty men.
<lb/>He hath come hither searching for his son,
<lb/>And with him high estate hath come to thee.
<lb/>Now must I take thee up and bear thee back
<lb/>Unscathed to him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He listened while she spake,
<lb/>His eyes were filled with tears, his heart was sad.
<lb/>Though he had seen no man, still he had learned
<lb/>Of her to speak in accents like her own,
<lb/>With much of wisdom and of ancient lore;
<lb/>Thus had he language, wisdom, and right rede,
<lb/>And looked to God for succour. Npw observe
<lb/>His answer to the fowl: <q>Hast thou in truth
<lb/>Become aweary of my company?
<lb/>Thy nest is unto me a shining throne,
<lb/>Thy pinions are my glorious diadem,
<lb/>And next to God I owe my thanks to thee,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="139"/>
<lb/>For thou hast turned my hardship into ease.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The bird replied: <q>If once thou dost behold
<lb/>The crown, the throne, and doings of the court,
<lb/>This nest will seem to thee of small account.
<lb/>Make but one trial of the ways of fate.
<lb/>I do not send thee hence in enmity ;
<lb/>I pass thee to a kingship. I would fain
<lb/>Have kept thee here with me, but for thyself
<lb/>To go is better. Bear this plume of mine
<lb/>About with thee and so abide beneath
<lb/>The shadow of my <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>. Henceforth if men
<lb/>Shall hurt or, right or wrong, exclaim against thee,
<lb/>Then burn the feather and behold my might,
<lb/>For I have cherished thee beneath my plumes
<lb/>And brought thee up among my little ones.
<pb n="247"/>
<lb/>Now like a black cloud will I bear thee off
<lb/>And carry thee to yonder spot uninjured.
<lb/>Let not thy heart forget to love thy nurse,
<lb/>For mine is breaking through my love of thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She thus consoled his heart, then took him up,
<lb/>Bore him with stately motion to the clouds,
<lb/>And swooping down conveyed him to his sire.
<lb/>The youth had hair descending to his breast,
<lb/>An elephantine form and cheeks like spring.
<lb/>His father seeing him groaned bitterly,
<lb/>Then quickly did obeisance to the bird,
<lb/>And offered thanks and praises o'er and o'er.
<lb/><q>Q queen of birds,</q> he said, <q>the righteous Judge
<lb/>Gave thee thy power and might and excellence,
<lb/>That thou shouldst be the helper of the helpless,
<lb/>And in thy goodness justest of the just.
<lb/>May'st thou for ever make thy foes to grieve
<lb/>And always be as mighty as thou art.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With that the bird, watched by the eyes of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>And all his company, soared mountainward.
<lb/>He gazing on the youth from head to foot
<lb/>Adjudged him fit for crown and throne; he had
<milestone unit="vullers" n="140"/>
<lb/>A lion's breast and limbs, a sunlike face,
<lb/>The heart of paladins, a hand to seek
<lb/>The scimitar, white lashes but with eyes
<lb/>Pitch-coloured, coral lips and blood-red cheeks.
<lb/>Except his hair there was no fault at all;
<lb/>None could discern in him another flaw.
<lb/>Sain's heart became like Paradise; he blessed
<lb/>His stainless child. <q>Have no hard thoughts,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Forget the past and warm thy heart with love
<lb/>Toward me—the meanest of the slaves of God.
<lb/>Henceforth since I have thee I swear by Him
<lb/>I will not fail in gentleness to thee,
<pb n="248"/>
<lb/>But will fulfil thy wishes good and bad:
<lb/>Henceforth thy will shall be my rule of right.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He clothed the young man like a paladin
<lb/>And turned to leave the mountain: having reached
<lb/>The plain he chose a charger for his son,
<lb/>As well as royal robes for him to wear,
<lb/>And gave to him the name of Zal-i-Zar,
<lb/>Though the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> called him at first Dastan.
<lb/>Then all the troops with gladness in their hearts
<lb/>Sought <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>. The drummers led on elephants,
<lb/>And dust rose like a mount of indigo.
<lb/>There was a sound of drums and clarions,
<lb/>Of golden gongs and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> bells, while all
<lb/>The horsemen shouted. Thus they journeyed home
<lb/>Until all joyfully they passed within
<lb/>The city, greater by one paladin.

<lb/><q>For ever live glad and of ardent soul!</q>
<lb/>But <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> bade that true-hearted man,

<lb/>They went toward the palace ; <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>
<lb/>Sat down with great rejoicing on the throne,
<lb/>And placed the royal crown upon his head.
<lb/>On this side sat <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, on that side <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Both glad and well content. The chamberlain
<lb/>Approached with stately step and brought in <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,

<lb/>Equipped with golden mace and golden crown.

<lb/>Oft ran I round the Mount but path was none;

<lb/>A slave am I, whose heart is full of sin
<lb/>Before the Master of the sun and moon;

<lb/>I have no other ground of confidence.
<lb/>This slave of Thine—the fostered of the fowl—
<lb/>Brought up in misery and wretchedness,
<lb/>Who hath but skins to wear instead of silk
<lb/>And sucketh raw flesh, not his mother's breast—
<lb/>Restore to me! Disclose for me a way
<lb/>To him and cut this present trouble short.
<pb n="251"/>
<lb/>Sear not my soul for my defect in love;
<lb/>Oh! pardon me this once and cheer my heart.</q>
<lb/>When I had spoken thus, the Lord vouchsafed
<lb/>To grant my prayer immediately: the bird
<lb/>Flew up, and soaring to the clouds wheeled round
<lb/>Above the head of me the infidel ;
<lb/>Then from the mountain like a cloud in spring
<lb/>Came with the form of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> clasped to her breast,
<lb/>And odours that fulfilled the world with musk.
<lb/>Mine eyes were tearless, and my lips were dry ;
<lb/>I feared the bird and yearned upon my son,
<lb/>So that my wits departed clean away.
<lb/>She brought him to me like the kindliest nurse,
<lb/>Whereat my tongue began to utter praise,
<lb/>And strange! I did obeisance to the fowl!
<lb/>She left my son and went, 'twas God's decree,
<lb/>And I have brought him, lord of earth! to thee,
<lb/>And told what heretofore was mystery.</q></p></div>

<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> then ordered the astrologers,

<lb/>And so forecast the prince's destiny :—
<lb/><q>What will he be on reaching man's estate ?
<lb/>Ye must inform me as to this at large.</q>
<lb/>They found the horoscope of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>This youth will be a famous paladin,
<lb/>A noble, shrewd, and valiant cavalier.</q>
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> rejoiced and <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s heart ceased from care.
<lb/>The ruler of the earth prepared a gift

<lb/>With jewelled patterns on a golden ground,
<lb/>Of bowls of emerald and turquoise cups,

<lb/>Containing saffron, musk, and camphor: these
<lb/>The servants brought with suits of mail and casques,
<lb/>Horse-armour, lances, maces, bows and arrows,
<lb/>A throne of turquoise and a crown of gold,
<lb/>A ruby signet-ring and golden girdle.
<lb/>Anon the monarch had a patent drawn,
<lb/>Like Paradise—all praise—investing <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>With Mai of <placeName><placeName>Hind</placeName></placeName>, Danbar, <placeName><placeName>Kabulistan</placeName></placeName>,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="145"/>
<lb/>And from <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName> up to the stream of Bust,
<lb/>Drawn strictly in accord to precedent.
<lb/>The patent written and the gifts prepared,
<lb/>They ordered out the horses for that chief
<lb/>Of paladins, who rising spake and said :—
<lb/><q>O chosen lord of justice and of right!
<lb/>Know that between the Moon and <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Fish</rs></rs> no <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>

<lb/>He then advanced and kissed the throne.</p>
<p><lb/>They bound
<lb/>The kettledrums upon the elephants -
<lb/>And started for <placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>. The towns

<pb n="253"/>
<lb/>Sistin was decked throughout like Paradise ;
<lb/>Its bricks were gold and all its soil pure musk.
<lb/>They flung about dinars, musk, drachms, and saftron,
<lb/>And made a holiday for all alike.
<lb/>The aspiring chiefs from all sides went to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And said: <q>May this youth's steps prove fortunate
<lb/>For thee, blithe-hearted, famous paladin !</q>
<lb/>And as they blessed him showered gems o'er <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>.
<lb/>For each man worthy was a gift prepared,

<lb/>The various virtues that adorn a king,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="146"/>
<lb/>And having called the fathers of the realm
<lb/>Harangued them in set terms at large, and said :—

<lb/>Against the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Kargasars</rs></rs>.<ref target="n.1"/> I take with me

<lb/>What I despised was precious to the fowl,
<lb/>Which reared him till he seemed a lofty cypress,
<lb/>And when the time for pardon came the Lord
<lb/>Of all the world—God—gave him back to me.
<lb/>Regard him as my representative,
<lb/>As mine own self cominitted to your charge ;
<lb/>I leave to you to teach him what is good
<lb/>And kindle every virtue in his breast.
<lb/>Hold him in honour, give him sound advice,

<p><lb/>He turned to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and said: <q>Be peaceful, just,

<lb/>And all things there as subject to thy will.
<lb/>Be thine to make the home more beautiful

<lb/>Was ever born defective it was I,
<lb/>And I have cause to wail. Put me not further
<lb/>Than ever from thee now that peace hath come.
<lb/>While I was neath the talons of the bird,
<lb/>Sucked blood and fared in dust, dwelt in a nest
<lb/>And had a fowl for friend, I was esteemed
<lb/>A fowl myself; but she that fostered me
<lb/>Is far away. Such is fate's fostering!
<lb/>I have no portion of the rose but thorns
<lb/>And must submit.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> answered: <q>Be at ease.
<lb/>Let thy heart rest; command whate'er thou wilt.
<lb/>The astrologers declare a gracious purpose
<lb/>Concerning thee—that here shall be thy home
<pb n="255"/>
<lb/>With host and crown. We cannot thwart heaven's will;

<lb/>The golden necklace and the golden girdle,
<lb/>And called the archmages out of every province
<lb/>In quest of knowledge both of men and things.
<lb/>Astrologers and men of sanctity,

<p><lb/>One day <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> set forth on a royal progress
<lb/>With chiefs attached to him in rede and Faith
<lb/>To view <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>, Dunbar, Margh, Mai and <placeName><placeName>Ind</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>At every stage he set him up a throne
<lb/>And called for wine and harp and minstrelsy.
<lb/>He lavished treasure and indulged in pleasure,
<lb/>As is the fashion in this Wayside Inn,
<lb/>And reached <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> with gladness in his heart.
<lb/>There was a certain monarch hight <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>A wealthy and successful potentate,
<lb/>In stature like a noble cypress-tree,
<lb/>With cheeks like springtide and with pheasant's tread ;
<lb/>He had a sage's heart, a ruler's brain,
<lb/>A warrior's shoulders and archmage's sense.
<lb/>Descended from <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>, he ruled <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>But having not the power to fight with <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Paid yearly tribute. Hearing that Sim's son
<lb/>Had come, he left <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> at dawn with treasure,
<lb/>With steeds caparisoned, slave-boys, dinars,
<lb/>Musk, rubies, spicery, brocade of gold,
<lb/>Silks, beaver-skins, a royal jewelled crown
<lb/>And golden torque with emerald ornaments.
<lb/>He took the chiefs and army of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>As escort. Tidings reached the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>The stately chief is coming in his state.</q>
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> went to meet and greet him courteously
<lb/>With every honour due. In merry mood
<lb/>They came together to the turquoise throne ;
<lb/>A table fit for paladins was spread
<lb/>And all sat down with gladness to the feast.
<pb n="257"/>
<lb/>There, while cup-bearers handed cups and wine,
<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> observed the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, on whom
<lb/>He joyed to gaze, and whom he longed to serve.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="150"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s wit and prudence made <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> exclaim :—
<lb/><q>His mother is immortal !</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>Rose from the board, <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> marked his mien and limbs,
<lb/>And said before the chiefs: <q>Who girdeth him
<lb/>More gracefully? Who hath such mien and carriage ?
<lb/>Men would pronounce him matchless in the fight.</q></p>
<p><lb/>One of the noble chieftains said to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> :-—
<lb/><q>He hath a daughter in his house whose face
<lb/>Is fairer than the sun, like ivory
<lb/>From head to foot, with cheeks like Paradise,
<lb/>And as a teak in height. Two musky ringlets
<lb/>Fall o'er her silvern neck, the ends of them
<lb/>Would serve for ankle-rings. Her cheeks are like
<lb/>Pomegranate-blossoms, she hath cherry lips,
<lb/>Her silvern breasts bear two pomegranate-grains,
<lb/>Her eyes are twin narcissi in a garden,
<lb/>Their lashes blackness rapt from raven's plumes,
<lb/>Her brows are like two bows made at <placeName><placeName>Taraz</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Whipped with the purest musk. If thou wouldst seek
<lb/>A moon, there is her face; if thou wouldst scent
<lb/>The musk, there is her hair. From head to foot
<lb/>She is as Paradise—all music, charm,
<lb/>And beauty.</q> 
<lb/>This raised tumult in the heart
<lb/>Of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, and rest and reason fled from him;
<lb/>He thought: <q>There is no doubt that this fair maid
<lb/>Is like the sun and moon, for since the sire
<lb/>Is comely still, how fair the child must be!</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="151"/>
<p><lb/>Night came; <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> sat in sad and anxious thought, 
<lb/>Concerned for her whom he had never seen,
<lb/>But when the sun's rays struck the mountain-tops
<pb n="258"/>
<lb/>And made the world white crystal he gave audience,
<lb/>And warriors with their golden scabbards came
<lb/>To grace the portal of the paladin.
<lb/>As these great men were calling for their steeds,
<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>, the ruler of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>, approached
<lb/>The tent of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, the ruler of <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>When he arrived the word was: <q>Clear the way.</q>
<lb/>Fresh in his beauty as a laden fruit-tree
<lb/>He came to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, who welcomed him with Joy,
<lb/>Gave him the chiefest room and said: <q>Request
<lb/>Whate'er thou wilt—throne, signet, sword or crown.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> replied: <q>Exalted, conquering king,
<lb/>Whose word is law! But one desire have I,
<lb/>And that an easy one for thee to grant—
<lb/>That thou be pleased to visit me and make
<lb/>My soul bright as the sun.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> said: <q>Not so:
<lb/>Thy palace is not one that I may visit,
<lb/>For <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> would not approve, nor would the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Of us for drinking wine and getting drunk
<lb/>With idol-worshippers. Save this request
<lb/>We grant thee all and joy to see thy face.</q></p>
<p><lb/>On hearing this <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> did reverence,
<lb/>But in his heart called <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> an infidel,
<lb/>Then strode forth blessing much the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who as he went praised him as he deserved.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="152"/>
<lb/>Now no one hitherto had noticed him,
<lb/>For all had thought him an outlandish div,
<lb/>And since his Faith and manners were not theirs
<lb/>Refrained from praising him ; but when <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> spake
<lb/>His admiration with such warmth, the courtiers
<lb/>Began to praise him too, his mien, his stature,
<lb/>His polished manners, tact and courtesy,
<lb/>While as for <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> his heart went clean distraught,
<lb/>His wisdom fled afar and love was lord.
<pb n="259"/>
<lb/>An <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> chief once said in this regard :—
<lb/><q>A horse shall while I live my comrade be,

<lb/>I want no bride to make me delicate,
<lb/>And cause the wise to mock at mine estate.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, who was stricken to the heart by care,
<lb/>Kept brooding o'er the matter, sorely pained
<lb/>For fear lest scandal might result and dim
<lb/>His glory. Thus heaven oft revolved above,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><head>How <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> took Counsel with her Damsels</head>
<p><lb/>It came to pass that at the dawn one day

<lb/>And going toward his women's bower beheld
<lb/>Two Suns within the hall; one was <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The fair of face, the other was <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The prudent and devoted ; both were decked

<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s hoary son? What is he suited for—
<lb/>A nest or throne? Doth he behave as man,
<lb/>And walk in chieftains' steps ?</q> 
<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>O fair-faced Cypress with the silvern breast !
<pb n="260"/>
<lb/>Of all the warrior- paladins of earth
<lb/>Not one can tread his steps; there is no portrait
<lb/>Inside our halls with such a bridle-hand,
<lb/>Or such another cavalier on horseback.
<lb/>He is in heart a lion and in strength
<lb/>An elephant: his hands are like the <placeName><placeName>Nile</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>When he is on the throne he scattereth gold,
<lb/>When he is in the fray he scattereth heads.
<lb/>His cheek is ruddy as the cercis-bloom:
<lb/>Shrewd, young in years and fortune too is he,
<lb/>In battle like the baleful crocodile,
<lb/>On horseback like a dragon with sharp claws.
<lb/>He layeth in the fight the dust with blood
<lb/>And brandisheth his falchion of blue-steel.
<lb/>He hath this one defect—his hair is white ;
<lb/>Fault-finders find in him no other fault ;
<lb/>Yet this white hair of his becometh him,
<lb/>And thou wouldst say: <q>He fascinateth hearts.</q> </q></p>
<p><lb/>On hearing this <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> blushed, with cheeks
<lb/>Red as pomegranate-blossoms, while her heart
<lb/>Became fulfilled with fire for love of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>:
<lb/>She could not eat or rest in peace; a change
<lb/>Came in her disposition and demeanour,
<lb/>For passion had usurped the place of wisdom.</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="154"/>
<p><lb/>How goodly were the teacher's words: <q>Deny

<lb/>The heart of woman is the <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Div</rs></rs>'s abode,
<lb/>If thou suggestest she will find the road.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> had five <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> waiting-maids,
<lb/>Five faithful slaves, all girls of prudent minds;
<lb/>To them she said: <q>I have a secret for you,
<lb/>Since all of you are in my confidence,
<lb/>Attend upon me, and dispel my cares;
<lb/>Know then, all five of you, and understand,
<lb/>And luck go with you all your years, that I—
<pb n="261"/>
<lb/>I am in love, and like a raging sea
<lb/>Whose billows surge to heaven! Mine ardent heart
<lb/>Is full of love for <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, and in my sleep
<lb/>I cannot tear my thoughts from him. His love
<lb/>Possesseth me, heart, mind, and wits; I muse
<lb/>Upon his features day and night; and now
<lb/>Means must be found to free me from my woe.
<lb/>None knoweth of my secret but yourselves,
<lb/>For ye are good and love me.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then the slaves
<lb/>Thought in amaze: <q>The princess doth amiss!</q>
<lb/>Rose at her like so many <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahrimans</rs></rs>
<lb/>And said: <q>O crown of ladies in the world!
<lb/>O daughter eminent among the mighty,
<lb/>Admired from <placeName><placeName>Hindustan</placeName></placeName> to <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>, and like

<lb/>No cypress in the garden equalleth
<lb/>Thy height; thy cheeks outshine the Pleiades.
<lb/>Thy portrait hath been sent out to <placeName><placeName>Kannuj</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>To Mai, and to the monarch of the West.
<lb/>Hath modesty departed from thine eyes
<lb/>And all consideration for thy sire
<lb/>That thou shouldst long to clasp upon thy bosom
<lb/>One whose own father hath rejected him—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="155"/>
<lb/>One fostered on a mountain by a fowl—
<lb/>A spectacle for all the folk? No mother
<lb/>Excepting his hath borne an agéd babe.
<lb/>Such offspring is ignoble. Strange indeed
<lb/>For two such coral lips and musky hair
<lb/>To seek a dotard! Why, all folk love thee;

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> heard, her heart flared up like fire
<lb/>Before a blast of air. She shrieked at them,

<lb/>With frowns that shut her eyes, exclaiming: <q>Bah!
<lb/>Ye strive in vain: it booteth not to hear.
<lb/>If to some star I lost my heart, could I
<lb/>Find any satisfaction in the moon ?
<lb/>Clay-eaters do not gaze upon the rose
<lb/>Although the rose is better than the clay.
<lb/>If vinegar will cure a body's liver,
<lb/>Then honey will but make the anguish worse.
<lb/>I want not Cesar or <persName><persName>Faghfur</persName></persName> of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Or any of the princelings of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>:
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, is tall enough for me
<lb/>And lion-like in shoulder, neck, and arm;
<lb/>For whether people call him old or young
<lb/>To me he giveth peace of soul and mind.
<lb/>Talk not of other men, be his my heart,
<lb/>Bit as it is by love of one whom I

<lb/>I do not love his face and hair but him;
<lb/>Tis for his merits that I seek his love.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The slaves, on hearing her distracted voice,

<p><lb/>One said: <q>O Cypress-stem! let none else know.

<lb/>Should there be need to study grammarye,

<lb/>Then will we fly like an enchanter's bird,
<lb/>Or run along like deer to give thee aid,
<lb/>So we may bring this king to thee our Moon,
<lb/>And lay him at thy feet.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> smiled,
<lb/>Turned safflower cheeks toward the slave and said :—
<lb/><q>If thou canst compass this thou wilt have planted
<pb n="263"/>
<lb/>A tall tree bearing rubies day by day
<lb/>Which wisdom in its breast will bear away.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><head>How <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>'s Damsels went to see Zaél</head>
<p><lb/>The slaves arose and went, remediless
<lb/>Themselves they sought a remedy for her.
<lb/>So donning raiment of brocade of <placeName><placeName>Rum</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And twisting roses in their hair, they went,
<lb/>The five of them, toward the river-side,
<lb/>Like jocund spring—ali colour and perfume.
<lb/>'Twas <rs type="month"><rs type="month">Farwardin</rs></rs>, the first month of the year,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s encampment was beside the stream ;
<lb/>The damsels were upon the farther bank.
<lb/>Their talk was all of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>. They gathered roses
<lb/>Along the river-side. Their cheeks were like
<lb/>A rosary, and roses filled their laps;
<lb/>But still they gathered roaming here and there.
<lb/>When they came opposite the royal tent
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, spying them from his high throne, inquired :—
<lb/><q>Who are these flower-worshippers ?</q>
</p>
<p><lb/><milestone unit="vullers" n="157"/>
<lb/>One said:— 
<lb/><q>The Beauty of <placeName><placeName>Kabulistan</placeName></placeName> hath sent
<lb/>Forth from the palace of bright-souled <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>Her waiting-maidens to the rosary.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s heart beat fast, and being love-distraught
<lb/>He walked attended by a single slave
<lb/>Beside the stream. Upon the further bank
<lb/>He saw the girls, drew himself up and bade
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> slave-boy bring the bow; then looked
<lb/>For game and lighted on a water-fowl.
<lb/>The ruddy <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> slave-boy strung the bow
<lb/>And laid it in the paladin's left hand,
<lb/>Who flushed the fow! and shot it as it rose.
<pb n="264"/>
<lb/>Blood dyed the water. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> said: <q>Go across
<lb/>And fetch yon erippled bird.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The gallant <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs>
<lb/>Crossed in a boat. The slave-girls questioned him
<lb/>About the paladin: <q>This lion-limbed
<lb/>And elephantine-bodied warrior—
<lb/>Who is he? Of what people is he king?
<lb/>What foe could counter him? We never saw
<lb/>A finer cavalier or better shot.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The pretty slave-boy bit his lip and said :—
<lb/><q>Speak not so of the king. The son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Is monarch of <placeName><placeName>Nimruz</placeName></placeName>, and other kings
<lb/>Call him <q>Dastan.</q> The sky revolveth not
o'er cavalier like him, nor will time see
<lb/>His peer.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The damsels laughed and answered thus
<lb/>The moon-faced boy: <q>Say not such things because
<milestone unit="vullers" n="158"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> hath now a Moon within his palace,
<lb/>Who is a whole head taller than thy king,
<lb/>A teak in stature, ivory in hue,
<lb/>Crowned with a crown of musk, a thing divine.
<lb/>Her eyes are pensive and her eyebrows arched ;
<lb/>Their column is a silvern reed. Her mouth
<lb/>Is narrow as the heart of one forlorn,
<lb/>Her tresses' ends are coiled like ankle-rings,
<lb/>Her witching eyes are full of dreamy light,
<lb/>Her cheeks are tulip-like in hue, her locks
<lb/>Like musk ; her soul is breathing through her lips.
<lb/>A matchless Moon is she! We from <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Approach the monarch of <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName> in state,
<lb/>And 'tis our policy to introduce
<lb/>Our lady's ruby lips to those of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Which is but well and seemly, for she is
<lb/>Of equal rank.</q></p>
<p><lb/>On hearing this the slave-boy
<pb n="265"/>
<lb/>Flushed ruby-like. <q>The Sun should wed the Moon,</q>
<lb/>He said. <q>Whene'er the world would make a match
<lb/>The hearts of all concerned find room for love,
<lb/>And when the world would cause a severance
<lb/>It parteth mate from mate without a word.
<lb/>Love's bond is hidden but its rupture seen,
<lb/>And both are common. Still the bachelor
<lb/>Enjoyeth peace at, home, and since he hath
<lb/>No daughter, will not hear reproachful words.
<lb/>Once said the male hawk to his brooding mate :—
<lb/><q>If hen-birds only from these eggs thou bring
<lb/>Thou makest of the sire a sexless thing.</q> </q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="159"/>
<p><lb/>Now when the laughing slave-boy had returned
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> asked: <q>What was it that they said to thee
<lb/>To make thee laugh and show thy silvern teeth ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He told the paladin, whose heart grew young
<lb/>With joy. He bade the moon-faced youth: <q>Return
<lb/>And say thus to yon damsels: <q>Stay awhile
<lb/>Among the roses; ye perchance may take
<lb/>Some gems as well as blossoms from the garden,
<lb/>So go not till ye hear from me.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>He took
<lb/>Gold, jewelry, and drachms, with five rich pieces
<lb/>Of gold brocade and bade his slaves : <q>Convey them
<lb/>To yonder girls, tell none and be not seen.</q>
<lb/>They took the treasures with an ardent message
<lb/>And gave them to the damsels in <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s name.
<lb/>Then said one damsel to the moon-faced page :—
<lb/><q>A matter never can be kept concealed
<lb/>Unless it be confined to only two;
<lb/>Three are no casket, four are all the world.
<lb/>So say to him, shrewd, trusty boy: <q>If thou
<lb/>Hast secret things to say tell us in person.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>'s damsels said to one another :—
<lb/><q>The Lion hath been taken in the toils.
<pb n="266"/>
<lb/>The wishes of <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> and of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>Have been fulfilled, and matters promise well.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The black-eyed youth, who brought the monarch's gifts .
<lb/>And acted for him, went and told his chief
<lb/>In secret what those charming damsels said.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="160"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> went. Those rosy Idols of <placeName><placeName>Taraz</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Drew near and did obeisance. He inquired
<lb/>About that Cypress-stem, her mien and looks,
<lb/>Her speech, her wisdom, and her rede, to see
<lb/>If she were worthy of him. <q>Speak,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Without attempting to prevaricate.
<lb/>If ye speak truth it will advantage you,
<lb/>But if I think that ye impose upon me
<lb/>An elephant shall trample you to death.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With cheeks that had become like sandarac
<lb/>The slave-girls kissed the ground before the chief,
<lb/>And one of them—the youngest of the troop,
<lb/>A girl of tenderness and ready speech,
<lb/>Spake thus to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>: <q>Among the mighty none
<lb/>Hath e'er been born of woman in this world
<lb/>Who could compare with <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> in looks and stature,
<lb/>In purity, in courage, sense, and knowledge ;
<lb/>Or yet with thee, thou valiant cavalier,
<lb/>Of lofty bearing and of lion-limbs!
<lb/>Or with Ruidaba in her loveliness,
<lb/>A silvern Cypress, coloured and perfumed,
<lb/>Compact from head to foot of rose and jasmine,
<lb/>While over it <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Canopus</rs></rs> of <placeName><placeName>Yaman</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Is shining. One would say: <q> Her face distilleth
<lb/>Wine, and her locks are scents.</q> Insidious lassos
<lb/>Fall from her head, that cupola of silver,
o'er cheeks of roses to the very ground.
<lb/>Her head is all a-twine with ambergris
<lb/>And musk, her person all a-shine with jewels.
<pb n="267"/>
<lb/>Her locks and ringlets are like musky mail
<lb/>Where <q>there is link on link</q> as one might say.
<lb/>Thou wilt not see in <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName> so fair an Idol:
<lb/>The moon and Pleiades bow down to her.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The chief on fire rejoined in sugared tones :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="161"/>
<lb/><q>Say, if thou knowest, how I may approach her.
<lb/>I love her, heart and soul, and long to see
<lb/>Her face.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She answered: <q>We, if thou shalt bid us,
<lb/>Will haste back to the palace of our Cypress,
<lb/>And then beguile her, telling all we can
<lb/>About the chief of paladins, his prudence,
<lb/>His looks, his converse, and his ardent soul,
<lb/>And 'tis an honest work. We will ensnare
<lb/>Her musky head and bring her lips to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s. 
<lb/>The paladin, a lasso in his hand,
<lb/>May haply stroll toward our stately home
<lb/>And fling the noose around a pinnacle.
<lb/>The Lion will rejoice to hunt the Lamb.
<lb/>Then gaze thy fill on her. Our talk shall be
<lb/>The earnest of far more felicity.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><head>How the Damsels returned to Riudaba</head>
<p><lb/>The girls departed, and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> thought the night
<lb/>A year. Meanwhile they reached the palace-gate,
<lb/>Each with two sprays of roses, where the porter,
<lb/>On catching sight of them, prepared to chide,
<lb/>And spake with sternness, hardening his heart :—
<lb/><q>A nice time this to be beyond the gates !
<lb/>I marvel at your gadding so about.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The Idols, when they found a word to say,
<lb/>Flew out at him in their embarrassment :—
<pb n="268"/>
<lb/><q>This day is just like any other one:
<lb/>There is no foul div in the rosary.
<lb/>'tis spring. We gather roses in the garden,
<lb/>And spikes of hyacinth upon the ground.
<lb/>Moon-faced Ruiddba bade, and so we went
<lb/>Hence after roses out of love for her;
<lb/>Then wherefore speak to us in such a tone
<lb/>For plucking them ?</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="162"/> 
<p><lb/><q>But this is not the time,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>for pranks like these; for bear in mind
<lb/>That <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> the chieftain now is at <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>:
<lb/>The land is covered with his tents and troops.
<lb/>Do ye not see <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> at early dawn
<lb/>Go from his palace-gate and mount his steed ?
<lb/>Why, every day he goeth to and fro
<lb/>Now he and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> have come to be such friends,
<lb/>And if he saw you carrying your roses —
<lb/>Would have you down upon the ground forthwith.
<lb/>Quit not the Haram more, and would to God
<lb/>That nothing great or small may come of this.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They went within and told the Moon in private :—
<lb/><q>We ne'er saw Sun like this with ruddy cheeks
<lb/>And hair all white.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>'s heart inflamed
<lb/>In expectation of beholding <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>.
<lb/>They laid his jewels and dinars before her,
<lb/>While she minutely questioned them: <q>How found ye
<lb/>The son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>? Doth he deserve his fame?</q>
<lb/>The five, encouraged, chattered on and said :—
<lb/><q><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> is the finest horseman, with such mien
<lb/>And <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>—a lofty cypress of a man.
<lb/>Imperial <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> and dignity are his.
<lb/>What fragrance, colour, stature, limbs, he hath!
<lb/>How slim a waist and what an open chest!
<lb/>His eyes are twin narcissi water-blue,
<pb n="269"/>
<lb/>His lips like coral and his cheeks like blood.
<lb/>His hand and forearm are like lion's paws.
<lb/>A shrewd man he, with an archmage's heart
<lb/>And royal <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>! while as for his white hair
<lb/>It is a blemish—but no cause for shame.
<lb/>This chief of paladins hath downy cheeks,
<lb/>Like cercis-bloom through silver habergeon,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="163"/>
<lb/>Such as.to make one cry: <q> Be ever thus:
<lb/>No change can make thee dearer than thou art.</q>
<lb/>We told him he should see thee; he was hopeful
<lb/>When we departed. Now devise a scheme
<lb/>To entertain him. Tell us what to tell him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She answered: <q>Once ye told a different tale!
<lb/>This <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, who was the nursling of a bird,
<lb/>Was so white-headed and so wizened! Now
<lb/>His cheek is like the cercis-bloom, and he
<lb/>Is tall and handsome, and a paladin !
<lb/>And ye have bragged about my face to him
<lb/>And asked for payment for your gossiping.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She spake with smiles and blushes on her cheeks,
<lb/>As 'twere pomegranate-blooms, then bade one damsel :—
<lb/><q>Be off with you at dawn. Take him good news,
<lb/>Hear what he hath to say and say to him :—
<lb/><q>Thy wish is granted ; be in readiness ;
<lb/>Come and behold thy Moon in all her charms,</q> </q></p>
<p><lb/>The waiting-maid departed, gave the message,
<lb/>And came back to the Cypress of <placeName><placeName>Taraz</placeName></placeName>. 
<lb/><q>Devise some means to compass it,</q> she said,
<lb/><q>For God hath granted thee thy whole desire,
<lb/>And may the ending be a happy one!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> soon made ready, while her kin
<lb/>Suspected naught. She had her own pavilion
<lb/>Like jocund spring and decked with great men's portraits.
<lb/>The servants draped it with brocade of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>,
<pb n="270"/>
<lb/>Set golden trays about as ornaments,
<lb/>Then mingled wine with musk and ambergris
<lb/>And scattered emeralds and carnelians.
<lb/>Here were narcissus, violet, cercis-bloom
<lb/>And rose, there lily and the jasmine-spray.
<lb/>The goblets were compact of gold and turquoise,
<lb/>The viands saturate with clear rose-water ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="164"/>
<lb/>Thus from the chamber of the sun-faced one
<lb/>Rose fragrant odours wafting to the sun.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><head>How <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> went to <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>At dusk they locked the gate and took the key,
<lb/>And then a damsel went to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>All is prepared, so come.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thereat the chief,
<lb/>All wooer-like, set out toward the palace.
<lb/>Meanwhile black-eyed and rosy-cheeked <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>—
<lb/>A cypress over which the full moon shone—
<lb/>Went to the roof, and, when the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>The cavalier appeared, that high-born maid
<lb/>Unlocked her coral lips and cried to him :—
<lb/><q>Thou art well come, O youth of noble birth!
<lb/>The Maker's blessing be on thee, the arch
<lb/>Of circling heaven be underneath thy feet,
<lb/>And may my maid be blithe of heart and glad,
<lb/>For, top to toe, thou art as she described thee.
<lb/>To foot it thus from thy pavilion
<lb/>Must irk thy royal feet.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He heard the voice
<lb/>And saw upon the wall a sun-cheeked damsel,
<lb/>Whose beauty set the roof a-gleam like gems,
<lb/>Whose blushes set the ground a-flush like rubies.
<pb n="271"/>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>O thou moon-faced one!
<lb/>My blessing and the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> of heaven be thine.
<lb/>How many nights with eyes up-turned to Spica
<lb/>Have I entreated Him who ruleth all,
<lb/>To let me privily behold thy face!
<lb/>Now thou dost make me happy with thy voice,
<lb/>Thy tender words and gentleness. Oh! find
<lb/>Some means to let me look on thee! For why
<lb/>Shouldst thou be on the roof and I below ?</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="165"/>
<p><lb/>The fairy-faced one heard the chieftain's words
<lb/>And doffed her scarlet wimple instantly.
<lb/>Then from her lofty cypress-form she loosed
<lb/>A lasso, such as none could plait, of musk:
<lb/>Coil within coil it was, and snake on snake;
<lb/>Strand over strand it lay upon her neck.
<lb/>She loosed her tresses o'er the battlements
<lb/>And when they straightened out they reached the ground.
<lb/>Then spake <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> from the wall above :—
<lb/><q>O paladin! O child of warrior-race!
<lb/>Now speed thee quickly and gird up thy loins,
<lb/>Exert thy lion-breast and royal hands.
<lb/>Seize these black tresses which hang down beside me
<lb/>All dedicate to thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> gazed on her
<lb/>In marvel at her hair and face. She heard
<lb/>Him kiss that musky lasso oft. He said :—
<lb/><q>This is not well; may no sun shine when I
<lb/>Shall lay a wanton hand upon my Life
<lb/>And put a spearpoint to this wounded heart.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He took a lasso from his servant, coiled
<lb/>And lightly flung it in his breathless haste.
<lb/>The noose caught and he mounted. Fairy-face
<lb/>Advanced to welcome him, she clasped his hand,
<lb/>And both intoxicate with love descended,
<pb n="272"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="166"/>
<lb/>Hand clasped in hand, to her pavilion
<lb/>Gold-arabesqued—a meeting-place for kings,
<lb/>A Paradise adorned—a blaze of light.
<lb/>Slave-girls attended on the Houri there,
<lb/>While <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> in rapt astonishment beheld
<lb/>Her face, her hair, her loveliness and grace,
<lb/>Her bracelets, torque, and earrings: her brocade
<lb/>And jewels were like gardens in the spring ;
<lb/>Her cheeks were like twin tulips in a garth ;
<lb/>Her crispy love-locks twisted curl on curl.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> sat in royal grace by that fair Moon,
<lb/>His dagger in his belt and on his head
<lb/>A ruby coronet. <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> looked
<lb/>And looked with stolen glances at him still ;
<lb/>Looked at that form, that neck, that grace, that height,
<lb/>Which used to make rocks brambles 'neath his mace,
<lb/>And at those cheeks whose lustre fired her soul.
<lb/>The more she gazed the more her heart inflamed :
<lb/>They kissed and clung intoxicate with love.
<lb/>What lion hunteth not the onager ?
<lb/>Thus spake the chieftain to the moon-faced maid :—
<lb/><q>O silver-bosomed Cypress, musk-perfumed !
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> will ne'er consent, and <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> will wring

<lb/>That I will never break my troth to thee.
<lb/>Nay I will first hold soul and body cheap
<lb/>And wear ashroud. I will seek God and pray Him,
<lb/>With all the instancy of devotees,
<lb/>To wash all opposition, wrath, and vengeance
<milestone unit="vullers" n="167"/>
<lb/>From both their hearts, and if He hearkeneth
<lb/>Thou shalt become my wife before the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> answered: <q>I too swear by Him—
<lb/>The God of Faith and right—that none but <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>Shall be my lord; the Maker is my witness.</q>
<pb n="273"/>
<lb/>Their love waxed ever as the moments sped,
<lb/>For wisdom was afar and passion near.
<lb/>So fared they till the day began to break
<lb/>And drum-call sounded. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> farewelled his Moon,
<lb/>Embracing her as warp and woof embrace.
<lb/>Both wept and both adjured the rising sun :-—
<lb/><q>O glory of the world! one moment more!
<lb/>Thou needst not rise so soon.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then from aloft
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> dropped his lasso and descending straight

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><head>How <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> consulted the Archimages in the Matter</head>
<p><lb/>- of <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>
<lb/>The warriors, when bright Sol rose o'er the hills,
<lb/>Went to the levee of the paladin,
<lb/>And then dispersed while <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> bade call the sages,
<lb/>They came—the ministers, archmages, heroes
<lb/>And glorious chieftains, men both wise and ardent—
<lb/>Well pleased at being summoned. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, all smiles
<lb/>And yearning, offered first his praise to God,
<lb/>Then roused the archimages to attention
<lb/>By thus addressing them: <q>Let all our hearts
<lb/>Regard with fear and hope the righteous Judge,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="168"/>
<lb/>Who is the Lord of circling sun and moon,
<lb/>And showeth souls the way of righteousness.
<lb/>To give Him all the praise that we can give
<lb/>We must bow down before Him night and day.
<lb/>By Him the jocund world abideth fast,
<lb/>By Him is justice done in heaven and earth.
<lb/>He bringeth summer, spring, and autumn-tide
<lb/>With fruit to fill the branches of the vines;
<pb n="274"/>
<lb/>Youth hath from Him its time of scent and bloom,
<lb/>Age hath from Him its time of saddened looks,
<lb/>None can transgress His will and ordinance :
<lb/>Without Him not an ant can walk the earth.
<lb/>He bringeth increase to the world by pairs,
<lb/>And not by one; there is no One but God,
<lb/>Who hath not any partner, mate, or peer,
<lb/>But all His creatures hath He made in pairs.
<lb/>This was His scheme—earth and its good for man;
<lb/>But save for pairing we had never known
<lb/>Its possibilities. Again, we never
<lb/>See youth unmated stable in the Faith,
<lb/>And thirdly, men though of a mighty stock
<lb/>Unmated lose their vigour. What can show
<lb/>More goodly than a chief of paladins,
<lb/>Whose soul is gladdened by his progeny ?
<lb/>He at life's close will have a New Year's Day
<lb/>In children who will keep his memory thus :—
<lb/><q>This is the son of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>.</q>
<lb/>Thus crown and throne are graced; the father's time
<lb/>Being over fortune resteth with the son.
<lb/>Ail these apply to mine own case, and are
<lb/>The roses and narcissi of my garden.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="169"/>
<lb/>My heart is lost, my wisdom fled! Declare
<lb/>The remedy for this. I have not spoken
<lb/>Before I suffered both in brain and wits.
<lb/>The palace of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>—I love it all!
<lb/>His land is heaven to me forwhy my heart
<lb/>Rejoiceth in the daughter of <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName>,.
<lb/>What say ye now? Will <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> too be rejoiced ?
<lb/>And will <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, if he shall hear,
<lb/>Regard it merely as a youthful error ?
<lb/>All—great and small—in marrying but obey
<lb/>The laws of Faith and custom. No wise man
<lb/>Will bar what honour and religion sanction.
<pb n="275"/>
<lb/>What do the prescient archimages say ?
<lb/>What are the sages' views?</q></p>
<p><lb/>They held their peace
<lb/>Because <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> was grandsire to <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> detested both. None dared
<lb/>To answer, none had heard of antidote
<lb/>And bane combined. Their silence grieved the chief,
<lb/>Who tried another plan: <q>I know,</q> said he,
<lb/><q>That ye will blame the course that I adopt,
<lb/>But every one who chooseth for himself
<lb/>Is certain to incur no lack of blame.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>How <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> wrote to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> to Explain the Case</head>
<p><lb/>The chieftain bade a scribe to come, poured forth
<lb/>His heart and wrote a letter of good cheer,
<pb n="276"/>
<lb/>And first he praised the Maker and the Judge,
<lb/><q>The Source of joy and might, the Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Of Sol and <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs></rs>, of being and not being.
<lb/>We all of us are slaves and God is One.
<lb/>May He bless <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the son of <persName><persName>Nariman</persName></persName>—
<lb/>The lord of mace, of scimitar, and helm,
<lb/>Whose black steed boundeth in the dust of fight,
<lb/>Who glutteth vultures when he maketh war,
<lb/>Who raiseth tempests on the battle-field,
<lb/>Who sheddeth gouts of blood from murky clouds,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="171"/>
<lb/>Who handleth golden belts and diadems
<lb/>And setteth kings upon their thrones of gold.
<lb/>His bravery achieveth feat on feat
<lb/>And they exalt his name. There liveth not,
<lb/>Nor ever will, a cavalier so brave.
<lb/>His thrall am I and love him heart and soul.
<lb/>He saw how I was born, and ills have come
<lb/>Since then upon me from the rolling sky.
<lb/>My father wore luxurious furs and silks;
<lb/>Me the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> bare to a mount in <placeName><placeName>Ind</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>Fain was I that the bird should bring me prey
<lb/>And number me among its little ones.
<lb/>My skin was scorched by blast, mine eyes were stopped
<lb/>With dust. They used to call me son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Though he was on a throne, I in a nest,
<lb/>Since God ordained and made this way for me.
<lb/>None scapeth His ordainment though one fly
<lb/>Among the clouds, gnaw spearheads, rend the hides
<lb/>Of lions with his shouting, yea although
<lb/>His teeth are anvils he is still God's slave.</q></p>
<p><lb/><lb/><q>A thing hath happened which I cannot tell
<lb/>To every one, and I am broken-hearted,
<lb/>Howbeit a sire, though fierce and dragon-like,
<lb/>Should hearken to the secrets of his child.
<lb/>My tears are for the daughter of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>,
<pb n="277"/>
<lb/>I am as if consumed in raging fire,
<lb/>The stars are my companions in the night,
<lb/>My breast is like a sea, I lose my wits
<lb/>So that my people weep; yet though sore troubled
<lb/>I will not draw a breath but at thy word.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="172"/>
<lb/>What doth the chief of paladins command ?
<lb/>Oh! free my mind from this distress and grief !
<lb/>The archimages have advised me thus :—
<lb/><q>Let not the chieftain keep his Jewel hidden
<lb/>But act with loyalty.</q> My sire perchance
<lb/>Will second me herein that I may make
<lb/>The daughter of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> my lawful wife.
<lb/>My father will remember that when God
<lb/>Restored me to him out of <placeName><placeName>Mount Alburz</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>He pledged his word in presence of his men :—
<lb/><q>I will not frustrate one wish of thy heart.</q>
<lb/>Now this it is whereon my heart is set.</q></p>
<p><lb/>A horseman left <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> at lightning-speed
<lb/>To go to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> and took a second horse,
<lb/>For <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> directed: <q>Should one roadster founder
<lb/>Stay not to breathe but lightly mount the other
<lb/>And hurry on to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The messenger
<lb/>Went, like the wind, upon a steed of steel.
<lb/>When he was drawing near the Kargasiars,
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, who was hunting on a range of hills,
<lb/>Beheld him from afar and told his comrades :—
<lb/><q>There cometh from <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> a messenger
<lb/>Upon a white steed of <placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Sent doubtlessly by <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, so let us learn
<lb/>His news.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The man approaching kissed the ground,
<lb/>With many thanks to God. <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> welcomed him
<lb/>And took the letter, while the man discharged
<milestone unit="vullers" n="173"/>
<lb/>His errands. <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> undid and read the letter
<pb n="278"/>
<lb/>While coming from the mountains, paled and halted
<lb/>In wonder not expecting or commending
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s conduct. <q>Yet,</q> he thought, <q>'tis natural :
<lb/>One nurtured by a bird would hanker thus.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When he returned he pondered long and deeply,
<lb/>And said: <q>If I shall say, <q> This is not well,
<lb/>Oppose me not, incline to wisdom's ways,</q>
<lb/>Both God and man will blame my breach of faith.
<lb/>If I say,<q> Yes,</q> and <q>Thy desire is good:
<lb/>Do as thou wilt,</q> what will their offspring be—
<lb/>This nursling of the fowl and that div's child ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He laid him down in grief but could not rest.
<lb/>The harder any servant's task, the more
<lb/>His heart is heavy and his suffering sore,
<lb/>The greater peace and comfort shall he know
<lb/>Within when God Almighty willeth so.</p>

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> when he woke asked the astrologers :—
<lb/><q>How will this end, for these two elements,

<lb/>Such surely on the Judgment Day will be
<lb/>The warfare of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>.

<p><lb/>They spent the day in searching, and then came

<lb/>In his behalf, and an astrologer
<lb/>Said: <q>Hero of the golden belt! we bring
<lb/>Good news about the daughter of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, for they will be a glorious pair,

<lb/>Will gird his loins with valour, overcome
<lb/>The world, will set the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>'s throne on the clouds,

<lb/>Shall grave it on their signets.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> gave ear
<lb/>And smiled as they congratulated him.
<lb/>He gave them gold and silver past all count
<lb/>Since peace had come in time of fear. He called
<lb/>The messenger, conversed with him and said :—
<lb/><q>Speak gently unto <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and say: <q>Thy wish
<lb/>Hath nothing in its favour, but since I
<lb/>Have pledged my word I must not seek a pretext
<milestone unit="vullers" n="175"/>

<p><lb/>He gave a largess to the messenger
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Arise and tarry not.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They bound a thousand of the Kargasdrs
<lb/>And dragged them off afoot in shame and woe.

<lb/>Toward dawn the horsemen's shouts rose o'er the plain,

<p><lb/>The messenger returned to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> in triumph
<lb/>With omens of success, When he arrived

<lb/>And offered praises to Almighty God
<lb/>For this great mercy and his blissful fate.
<lb/>He lavished on the poor drachms and dinars
<lb/>And showed especial kindness to his kindred,
<lb/>Invoking blessings on the chieftain <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>For having sent a gentle answer back.

<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> called this woman, told about his sire,
<lb/>And said to her: <q>Go to <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>. Say:
<milestone unit="vullers" n="176"/>
<lb/><q>O Beauty kind and young! when matters come
<lb/>To grievous straits we quickly find a key
<lb/>For their enlargement. Now the messenger
<lb/>Hath come from <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> rejoicing with good news.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> hummed and hawed but in the end consented.</q> </q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> sent his father's letter by the woman,
<lb/>Who hurried with the good news to <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>.
<pb n="281"/>
<lb/>That fay-faced damsel showered drachms upon her,
<lb/>Placed her upon a gold-embroidered seat
<lb/>And for her news gave her a change of raiment ;
<lb/>Then brought an <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> turban woven so finely
<lb/>That warp and woof were not distinguishable,
<lb/>With patterns wrought thereon in gold and rubies,
<lb/>So that the gold was hidden by the gems.
<lb/>This, and a costly finger-ring to match,
<lb/>As bright as <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Jupiter</rs></rs>, she sent to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,
<lb/>With many greetings, many messages.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> observed the woman in the hall
<lb/>And cried: <q>Whence art thou? Speak! Dissemble not !
<lb/>Thou passest in and out from time to time
<lb/>Without regard to me. I much suspect thee.
<lb/>Wilt thou not say if thou art string or bow?</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="177"/>
<p><lb/>With face like sandarac she kissed the ground
<lb/>And answered thus: <q>A needy woman I,
<lb/>Who have to get my living as I can;
<lb/>I visit houses of the gentlefolk
<lb/>Who purchase clothes of me and jewelry.
<lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> wished to buy rich gems and trinkets ;
<lb/>I brought to her a gold adorned tiara
<lb/>And hoop of royal gems.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> said : <q>Show them
<lb/>And quench my wrath.</q>
<lb/><q>I left them with <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>,</q>
<lb/>The woman answered, <q>and am fetching more.</q>
<lb/><q>Show me the purchase-money,</q> said <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName>,
<lb/><q>And set my heart at rest.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The woman answered :—
<lb/><q>The moon-faced lady told me she would pay
<lb/>To-morrow. Wait until I have the money.</q>
<lb/>Perceiving that she lied <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> used force,
<lb/>Searched up her sleeves and found her knavery.
<pb n="282"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> discovering <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>'s ring
<lb/>And costly stuffs was very wroth, and catching
<lb/>The woman by the tresses flung her down
<milestone unit="vullers" n="178"/>
<lb/>Upon her face, and in a burst of rage
<lb/>Haled her in shameful plight along the ground,
<lb/>Then let her fall, and bound and spurned and smote her.
<lb/>The queen returned in dudgeon to the palace,
o'erwhelmed with disappointment, pain, and grief,
<lb/>Shut herself in and was as one bemused.
<lb/>She sent to call her daughter and the while
<lb/>Kept buffeting her face, and from her eyes—
<lb/>Rhose wet narcissi—bathed her burning cheeks;
<lb/>Then to <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>: <q>O thou noble Moon!
<lb/>Why choosest thou the ditch and not the throne ?
<lb/>In what respect can I have failed to teach thee
<lb/>Propriety in public and in private ?
<lb/>My pretty! wherefore hast thou wronged me so?
<lb/>Tell mother all thy secrets—who despatched
<lb/>This dame to thee and why. What is all this?
<lb/>Who is the man for whom this splendid turban
<lb/>And finger-ring are meant? In that great treasure—
<lb/>The Arabian crown—much good and ill was left us.
<lb/>It had a name. Wilt fling it to the winds?
<lb/>May mother never bear a child like mine!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> looked away and hung her head
<lb/>In overwhelming shame before her mother,

<p><lb/><q>O most wise mother!</q> thus she made reply,
<lb/><q>Love hunteth down my soul, but I had wrought
<lb/>No good or ill hadst thou not borne me first.
<lb/>The chieftain of <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName> is at <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And love of him so fireth me, and things
<lb/>Have come to such a pass within my heart
<lb/>That, if in others' presence or alone,
<lb/>I weep and only live to see his face.
<pb n="283"/>
<lb/>One hair of his is worth the world to me.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="179"/>
<lb/>Know too that he hath seen and sat beside me,
<lb/>And that we hand in hand have plighted troth.
<lb/>We did but see each other—nothing more—
<lb/>And lo! a fire sprang up betwixt us twain.
<lb/>A messenger was sent to mighty <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>And he hath given his valiant son an answer.
<lb/>Though vexed at first he grew amenable
<lb/>And gave large presents to the messenger.
<lb/>By means of her whose hair thou didst pluck out,
<lb/>And whom thou didst fling down and hale along
<lb/>Upon the face, I have read all his letter:
<lb/>This stuff was my reply.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> was lost
<lb/>In wonder, glad that <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> should wed <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>,
<lb/>But said: <q>This is no trifle. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> is peerless
<lb/>Among the chiefs for valour, he is great,
<lb/>Son of the paladin of paladins,
<lb/>With all the virtues, and a single fault
<lb/>Which dwarfeth them—the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> will be displeased
<lb/>And send the dust up sunward from <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>He wisheth not that any of our race

<p><lb/>Then, to make it seem
<lb/>That she had been mistaken, she released
<lb/>The woman and made much of her, and said :-—
<lb/><q>Act ever thus, discreet and clever dame!
<lb/>Shut fast thy lips. God grant they never prove
<lb/>A chink for speech. Now hide this in the dust.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She saw her daughter's secret bent was such

<lb/>Canst thou see one whom heaven hunteth not ?
<lb/>Fret as we will our woes remain; we cannot

<lb/><q>The wise would take a very different view

<p><lb/>She hung her head and bent her cypress-form,
<lb/>Her eyes dropped dew upon her rosy cheeks.
<lb/><q>O full of wisdom,</q> she went on to say,
<lb/><q>The sky must not revolve above us thus.
<lb/>Know that the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> hath striven to snare

<lb/>Now 'tis for us to find a remedy.
<lb/>I have exhorted her without avail ;
<lb/>Her heart I see is troubled, her face wan.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thereat <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> sprang up and seized his sword,

<p><lb/>He shook her off
<lb/>And bellowed like a maddened elephant :—
<lb/><q>I should have cut her head off at her birth.
<lb/>I left her grandsire's way and let her live;
<lb/>Now she hath wrought on me this devilry.
<lb/>The son who walketh not his father's path
<lb/>Is but a bastard in a brave man's eyes.

<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> did reverence, bending to the ground ;
<lb/>Then with her lips all smiles and face that showed
<lb/>The dawn beneath the night went to her daughter
<lb/>With this good news: <q>The warrior-leopard's claws
<lb/>Have spared the wilful onager. Now hasten!
<lb/>Take from thy face thine ornaments and go
<lb/>Before thy father, weeping bitterly.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> answered : <q>What are ornaments ?
<lb/>What are these worthless trinkets to my wealth ?
<lb/>My soul is wedded to the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>;
<lb/>Why hide what is so plain?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then went she in
<lb/>Before her father, like a rising sun,
<lb/>And overwhelmed in gold and jewelry.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="184"/>
<lb/>Her father called on God in mute amaze.
<lb/>She was a Paradise adorned and fair,
<lb/>Like shining Sol in jocund spring. He said :—
<lb/><q>O witless one! would virtuous folk approve
<lb/>That <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> should have a fairy-bride ?
<lb/>May neither crown nor finger-ring be thine.
<lb/>If but a serpent-charmer from Kahtan
<lb/>Turned Magian we should slay him with an arrow.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Whenas <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> heard her father's words
<lb/>Her heart grew full, her face like fenugreek.
<lb/>She let her dark eyelashes droop and veil
<lb/>Her melancholy eyes and scarcely breathed,
<lb/>Her father all the while with furious heart
<lb/>And full of menace roaring like a pard.
<lb/>With blood returning to her pallid cheeks
<lb/>His love-sick daughter went back to her chamber,
<lb/>Where with her mother who had gained the day
<lb/>She prayed Almighty God to be their stay.

<p><lb/>News of the friendship of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>And of that noble ill-matched pair of lovers
<lb/>Reached <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>. The matter was discussed
<lb/>Before him by the archmages. Said the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> :—
<lb/><q>A dismal time will come on us hereby.
<lb/>Did <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> purge this world of <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>
<lb/>That at <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> Mibrab—his seed—might flourish ?
<milestone unit="vullers" n="185"/>
<lb/>This love of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s must not through our neglect
<lb/>Restore the drooping plant to its old vigour.
<lb/>If from the daughter of Mibhrab, and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, a sharp Sword should be drawn,
<lb/>On one side he will be an alien,

<lb/>He will fulfil <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> with strife and travail
<lb/>In hope to win the crown and treasure back.
<lb/>What is your rede? Strive to advise me well.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then all the archimages blessed the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>They hailed him as the king of the Pure Faith,

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName> set forth,

<pb n="289"/>
<lb/>Went with the paladins to welcome him

<milestone unit="vullers" n="186"/>
<lb/>Anon they met and interchanged their greetings.
<lb/>The hero <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> rejoiced to see the prince,

<lb/><q>I will obey and joy to look on him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>For that day they remained the guests of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The sight of whom rejoiced the company ;
<lb/>They spread the board, they took the cup in hand,

<lb/>They went as bidden. When he heard thereof

<pb n="290"/>
<lb/>While <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, encrowned with sparkling gems,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="187"/>
<lb/>Rose from his ivory throne and made <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> sit
<lb/>Beside him, showed the chieftain all observance
<lb/>And questioned him at large and anxiously
<lb/>About the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Kargasars</rs></rs>, about his troops,
<lb/>About the tierce divs of <placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>The chief told all and said: <q>Live happy ever,
<lb/>O <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>! ne'er may foe's malice touch thy life.
<lb/>I marched upon that land of valiant divs,
<lb/>And such divs too, like lions in the fight,
<lb/>More swift than <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> horses and out-daring
<lb/>The warriors of frin! The fierce Sagsérs—
<lb/>Pards in the fray—concerned at mine approach,
<lb/>Sent up the battle-cry within their cities,
<lb/>And all turned out to fight—a mighty host,
<lb/>From mountain unto mountain naught but men,
<lb/>So that the bright day vanished in the dust.
<lb/>All eager for the fray they came upon me,
<lb/>Came with a reckless rush! A panic fell
<lb/>Upon my troops. <q>How shall I bear,</q> I thought,
<lb/><q>This anguish?</q> and I saw not; for the brunt
<lb/>Had fallen then on me. I roared against them,
<lb/>I whirled a mace that weighed three hundred mans<ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>And urged mine iron steed. I came among them
<lb/>And brained them till the foe was panic-stricken.
<lb/>The grandson of the valiant worldlord <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName>,
<lb/>As 'twere a wolf, was foremost of thern all.
<lb/>The youth was named Karkwi, a lofty Cypress,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="188"/>
<lb/>Descended through his mother from <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName>.
<lb/>The heads of nobles were but dust to him.
<lb/>His army thronged like locusts or like ants
<lb/>And hid dale, plain, and mountain. When the dust
<lb/>Rose from that great host, and my troops turned pale,
<lb/>I reared the mace whereof one blow sufiiceth
<note n="1">A <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs></rs> measure of weight varying greatly in different localities.</note>
<pb n="291"/>
<lb/>And led the army on. I raised a shout
<lb/>That made earth seem a millstone to the foe,
<lb/>While all my host was heartened and resolved
<lb/>To battle on. Karkwi, who heard my voice,
<lb/>And blows down-crashing from mine iron mace,
<lb/>Came like a monstrous elephant against me
<lb/>To battle, carrying a mighty lasso,
<lb/>And sought to catch me in its noose, but I
<lb/>Was ware and moved me from destruction's path.
<lb/>I took a royal bow and poplar arrows
<lb/>With points of steel, and urging on my charger
<lb/>To eagle's speed I showered shafts like fire
<lb/>And deemed his helm pegged to his anvil head
<lb/>Until I saw him coming mid the dust,
<lb/>Like some mad elephant, with <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> sword
<lb/>In hand. Methought, O <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>! that e'en the moun- tains
<lb/>Would cry to him for quarter! He pressed on,
<lb/>And I held back to tempt him to come near ;
<lb/>Then, when he closed with me, reached from my grey,
<lb/>Seized on the girdle of that mighty man
<lb/>And like a lion wrenched him from his saddle;
<lb/>Then like a maddened elephant I dashed him
<lb/>Upon the ground so that his bones were shivered.
<lb/>Their prince o'erthrown his soldiers fled the fight ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="189"/>
<lb/>The vales and hills, the deserts and the mountains,
<lb/>Were crowded everywhere, while of the fallen 
<lb/>Upon the field we reckoned up ten thousand
<lb/>Of horse and foot. Troops, citizens, and horsemen
<lb/>Were verily three hundred thousand strong ;
<lb/>But weighed against thy fortune what are foes
<lb/>Confronted by a servant of thy throne?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, on hearing what his chieftain said,
<lb/>Raised to the moon his glorious diadem,
<lb/>Bade hold a festival and saw with joy
<pb n="292"/>
<lb/>The world freed from his foes. The night passed quickly
<lb/>In revelry and praises of the chieftain.
<lb/>At dawn the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> held audience. <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> drew near
<lb/>And having done obeisance sought to speak
<lb/>About <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, but was prevented
<lb/>By <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, who said with angry looks :—

<lb/>The palace of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>, and all <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>.

<lb/>With turmoil. As for his allies and kindred,

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> dared not speak, so wrathful was the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>But kissed the throne, then gently pressed his face

<lb/>With elephants whose backs were draped with banners

<lb/><q>Thy father is displeased with thee,</q> they told him;

<p><lb/>He said: <q>I fear not, for man's end is dust.

<p><lb/>They reached <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s court

<lb/><q>Glad be the paladin's shrewd heart,</q> he said,

<lb/>Thy falchion scorcheth adamant, earth weepeth
<lb/>When thou art fighting. Where thy charger pranceth

<pb n="294"/>
<lb/>Receive it at thy hands. So do not I;
<lb/>I have no share though thine acknowledged kinsman.
<lb/>I am the dust-fed nursling of a bird
<lb/>And know no feud with any, and no fault
<lb/>To give occasion to an enemy
<lb/>Save this, that <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the hero is my sire
<lb/>And mine accomplishment beneath such birth.
<lb/>Or ever I was born thou didst expose me
<lb/>Upon the mountains, harrowing my mother,
<lb/>And giving to the flames a thriving child.
<lb/>I saw no cradle and no breast of milk,
<lb/>IT had no memory of any kindred,
<lb/>For thou didst cast me out, deprive my heart
<lb/>Of peace and tenderness, and strive against
<lb/>The Maker, for who maketh white and black ?
<lb/>Now since the Maker hath provided for me,
<lb/>And looked upon me with a Master's eye,
<lb/>Skill, manhood, and a hero's sword are mine
<lb/>And one friend too, himself the crown of chiefs,
<lb/>The brave, wise, prudent monarch of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>I sojourned at <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> by thy command
<lb/>And mindful of thy counsel and thy pledge.
<lb/>Thou saidst: <q>I ne'er will vex thee, but will bring

<lb/>Yet bringest this gift from <placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And hastest from the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Kargasars</rs></rs> to further

<lb/>Behold, I stand before thee and expose

<lb/>Do as thou wilt; the power is all thine own,

<lb/>The chief attended to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s words, then bowed
<lb/>His head and answered :—<q> 'Tis all true, and I
<lb/>Have dealt with thee unjustly from the first
<pb n="295"/>
<lb/>And given foes occasion to rejoice.
<lb/>What thou hast asked me is thy heart's desire
<lb/>And in thy trouble thou couldst find no rest;
<lb/>Yet be not rash, let me despatch the business.
<lb/>I will indite a letter to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>And send it by thy hand, my loving son!
<lb/>The worldlord will not seek to do thee harm
<lb/>When he shall see thy prowess and thy looks,

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> wrote at large and set forth every plea.
<lb/>The letter opened with the praise of God,
<lb/>Who is established in His seat for ever :—
<lb/><q>From Him are good and evil, life and death:
<lb/>We all of us are slaves and God is One.
<lb/>The process of the sky is over all
<lb/>That He—the Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs></rs>, Sun, and Moon—
<lb/>Hath willed. His blessing be upon the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>—
<lb/>In fight an antidote-consuming bane,
<lb/>In feast a moon that lighteneth the world—
<lb/>Who brandisheth the mace, who stormeth cities,
<lb/>Who giveth unto each his meed of joy,
<lb/>Who marcheth with the flag of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>To war, and slayeth haughty warrior-leopards.
<lb/>The lofty mountain shattered by thy mace
<lb/>Becometh dust upon thy proud steed's hoofs,
<pb n="296"/>
<lb/>While thy pure heart and stainless Faith constrain
<lb/>Both wolf and sheep to water at thy cistern.
<lb/>A slave am I whose race is run, a slave
<lb/>Who hath attained to sixty years twice told.
<lb/>My head is strewn with camphor-dust—a crown
<lb/>That sun and moon have given me. I girt
<lb/>My warrior-loins and slaved. I fought the warlocks.
<lb/>None e'er saw<ref target="n.1"/> horseman rein his steed, fell chiefs,
<lb/>Or wield a mace like ne. My mighty mace
<lb/>Kclipsed the warriors of <placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>Did naught beside exalt me over all—
<lb/>There was a dragon haunting the Kashaf
<lb/>And making earth afoam. It reached from city
<lb/>To city and from hill to hill, the hearts
<lb/>Of all were filled with panic: men kept watch
<milestone unit="vullers" n="195"/>
<lb/>Both night and day. That dragon cleared the sky
<lb/>Of flying fowl and earth of beast of prey.
<lb/>It scorched the vulture's feathers with its blast,
<lb/>Set earth a-blazing where its venom fell,
<lb/>Dragged from the water gruesome crocodiles,
<lb/>And swiftly flying eagles from the air.
<lb/>Men and four-footed beasts ceased from the land ;
<lb/>The whole world gave it room. So seeing that none
<lb/>Dared to lay hand upon it, in God's strength
<lb/>I banished terror from my heart, girt up
<lb/>My loins in His exalted name, and rode
<lb/>Mine elephantine steed. My saddle bore
<lb/>Mine ox-head mace, upon mine arm I carried
<lb/>My bow, and at my neck my shield. I went
<lb/>Forth like a savage crocodile. My hand
<lb/>Was keen, keen too the dragon's breath, and all
<lb/>Farewelled me when they saw me wield my mace.
<lb/>I came. The dragon seemed a lofty mountain
<lb/>And trailed upon the ground its hairs like lassos.
<note n="1">Reading with C.</note>
<pb n="297"/>
<lb/>Its tongue was like a tree-trunk charred, its jaws
<lb/>Were open and were lying in my path.
<lb/>Its eyes were like two cisterns full of blood.
<lb/>It bellowed when it saw me and came on
<lb/>In fury, seeming all afire, O <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>!
<lb/>Within. The world 'gan swim before mine eyes,
<lb/>A black reek went up to the murky clouds,
<lb/>Earth's surface shook beneath the bellowing,
<lb/>The venom seemed to be a sea of <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>Then like a gallant warrior I roared
<lb/>Against that dragon, as a lion roareth,
<lb/>And tarried not, but fitted to my bow
<lb/>A poplar arrow tipped with adamant
<lb/>And shot it at the dragon's jaws, to pin
<lb/>The tongue against the throat; the tongue lolled pinned;
<lb/>The dragon was astound. Again I shot,
<lb/>Again I pierced the mouth; the creature writhed.
<lb/>I shot a third shaft right adown its jaws ;
<lb/>Its heart's blood spouted seething. When it closed
<milestone unit="vullers" n="196"/>
<lb/>And pressed me hard I took mine ox-head mace
<lb/>And in the strength of God, the Lord of all,
<lb/>Urged on mine elephantine steed and smote
<lb/>The dragon's head: thou wouldst have said that heaven
<lb/>Rained mountains down thereon. I smashed the skull,
<lb/>As it had been a mighty elephant's,
<lb/>And venom poured forth like the river <placeName><placeName>Nile</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>So struck I that the dragon rose no more
<lb/>While earth was levelled to the hills with brains.
<lb/>Kashaf was flowing like a stream of gall
<lb/>And all was peace. The mountain-tops were thronged
<lb/>With folk who called down blessings on my head,
<lb/>Because that dragon was a fearful bane.
<lb/>On this account men called me <q>One blow</q> <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And all threw jewels o'er me. I departed
<lb/>With all my shining body bare of mail ;
<pb n="298"/>
<lb/>My charger's armour dropped from him in pieces;
<lb/>I sickened with the venom many days.
<lb/>There was no harvest in those parts for years
<lb/>Nor aught except the ashes of burnt thorns.
<lb/>To tell my conflict with the divs would make
<lb/>The letter tedious, but in that and elsewhere
<lb/>I trampled underfoot the heads of chieftains,
<lb/>And wheresoe'er I rode my wind-foot charger
<lb/>I cleared that region of the rending lion.
<lb/>And now this many a year my saddle's back
<lb/>Hath been my throne, my charger been mine earth.
<lb/>My massive mace hath brought beneath thy sway
<lb/><placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName> and all the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Kargasars</rs></rs> ;
<lb/>I ne'er have asked for field or fell but sought
<lb/>To make thee both victorious and happy.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="197"/>
<lb/>My neck and mace-blows are not what they were,
<lb/>My breast and loins are bent; I used to throw
<lb/>A lasso sixty cubits long, but now
<lb/>Am bent by time and have resigned my duties
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, as worthy of my mace and girdle.
<lb/>Like me he will destroy thy foes and make
<lb/>My heart glad with his prowess. He hath come
<lb/>To ask the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> to grant his secret longing,
<lb/>One excellent in God's sight, apart from Whom
<lb/>There is no excellence, We have not moved
<lb/>Therein as yet but wait the great king's will,
<lb/>For slaves must not presume. My lord the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>The guardian of the world, hath surely heard
<lb/>How once and publicly I promised <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,
<lb/>When I was bringing him from <placeName><placeName>Mount Alburz</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Not to refuse him aught, and he hath come,
<lb/>Besmeared with blood and dust, and bones in bits,
<lb/>With his request. He said: <q>'Twere better far
<lb/>To hang <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName><ref target="n.1"/> than fall upon <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>.</q>

<lb/>But when a fowl-fed outcast on the mountains
<lb/>Seeth in <placeName><placeName>Kabulistan</placeName></placeName> so bright a Moon—
<lb/>A Cypress slim crowned with a rosary—
<lb/>It is no wonder if he goeth mad,
<lb/>Nor ought the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> to visit it upon him.
<lb/>All pity him, his pangs of love are such !
<lb/>His many undeserved afflictions borne
<lb/>Evoked the promise that the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> hath heard,
<lb/>And I have sent him with a heavy heart.
<lb/>When he shall come before thy lofty throne
<lb/>Do that which is most consonant with greatness ;
<lb/>There is not any need to teach thee wisdom.
<lb/>Him and him only have I in the world
<milestone unit="vullers" n="198"/>

<lb/>From <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the son of <persName><persName>Nariman</persName></persName> be blessings
<lb/>A thousand fold upon the king of kings
<lb/>And on the lords.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When all things were prepared
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> took the letter hastily, arose,
<lb/>Went forth and mounted mid the blare of trumpets.
<lb/>A troop of warriors went with him to court

<lb/>He said: <q>The only course for me, since I

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> sank down before him and considered.
<lb/>Then having hit on an expedient,
<lb/>For she was shrewd and subtle, came before
<lb/>The sunlike king with folded arms and said :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="199"/>
<lb/><q>Hear but one word from me, then do thy will.
<lb/>If thou hast wealth to purchase life bestow it,
<lb/>And know thou that this night is big with fate.
<lb/>Yet though night seemeth long 'twill pass, and earth

<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> replied: <q>No old wives' tales to warriors !
<lb/>Say what thou know'st and use all means for life,
<lb/>Or else array thee in the robe of blood.</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>There is no need of that, great king!
<lb/>But I must go to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> to draw this sword
<lb/>And to appeal to him in fitting terms,
<lb/>For wisdom is the cook when speech is raw.
<lb/>To labour for our lives is my part, thine
<lb/>To find the presents and entrust to me
<lb/>Thy hoarded wealth.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Here is the key,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>One must not always grieve at spending treasure.
<lb/>Prepare slaves, horses, thrones, and casques to go.
<lb/>We yet may save our country from the flames
<lb/>To shine though faded now.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>If thou desirest life hold treasure cheap.
<lb/>While I avert the danger thou must use
<lb/>No harshness toward my child. My greatest care
<lb/>Here is her life; give me a pledge for that.
<pb n="301"/>
<lb/>I care not for myself; all my concern
<lb/>And travail are for her.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She took his pledge,
<lb/>Then boldly faced the danger, clad herself
<lb/>All in brocade of gold with pearls and jewels
<lb/>About her head, and from the treasury took
<lb/>Three hundred thousand pieces as a largess.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="200"/>
<lb/>They brought forth thirty steeds of <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> stock

<lb/>And sixty slaves with golden torques, each bearing

<lb/>Gold, turquoises, and jewels of all kinds;
<lb/>One hundred female camels with red hair,
<lb/>One hundred baggage-mules; a crown of jewels
<lb/>Fit for a king, with armlets, torques, and earrings ;
<lb/>A throne of gold like heaven, all inlaid
<lb/>With divers sorts of gems, the width thereof
<lb/>Was twenty royal cubits and the height
<lb/>The stature of a noble horseman; lastly
<lb/>Four mighty <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> elephants to bring

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><head>How Sdém comforted <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>The treasures having been despatched she mounted
<lb/>In warrior-guise, swift as a lightning-flash,
<lb/>Assumed a Ruiman helm and rode a steed
<lb/>As swift as wind, approached <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s court unknown
<lb/>And bade the officers announce her thus :—
<lb/><q>An envoy from <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> hath come to seek

<pb n="302"/>

<p><lb/>The chamberlain

<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> dismounted, hasted to the chief
<milestone unit="vullers" n="201"/>
<lb/>And kissed the ground, with praises of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>And of the chief of paladins. The largess,
<lb/>The slaves, the horses, and the elephants
<lb/>Stretched from the gate two miles. She offered all
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, who sat there dazed, like one bemused,
<lb/>With folded arms and drooping head. He thought :—
<lb/><q>Come female envoys from so rich a country ?
<lb/>If I accept the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> will be displeased ;
<lb/>If I decline then <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> will be chagrined
<lb/>And flap his wings about like the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He raised his head and said: <q>As for these goods,
<lb/>These slaves and elephants caparisoned,
<lb/>Go give them to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s treasurer as presents
<lb/>Sent by the Beauty of <placeName><placeName>Kabulistan</placeName></placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then fairy-faced <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> essayed to speak,
<lb/>Rejoicing that her offerings were accepted
<lb/>And all had ended well. Three of her handmaids,
<lb/>With idol-faces, tall as cypresses
<lb/>And fair as jasmine, bearing each a goblet
<lb/>Which brimmed with pearls and rubies, poured them out
<lb/>In one promiscuous shower before the chieftain.
<lb/>This done and strangers gone she said to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>Thy counsel maketh old folk young. Thou teachest
<milestone unit="vullers" n="202"/>
<lb/>The mighty wisdom, who through thee illume

<p><lb/><lb/><q><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>, if any, was to blame, and he

<lb/>He would not countenance such acts from thee:
<lb/>Gird not thy loins for bloodshed.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Come tell me what I ask and palter not.
<lb/>Art thou the slave or consort of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Whose daughter <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> hath seen? Tell me that I

<lb/>Her face, hair, stature, looks, and understanding—
<lb/>Whatever thou hast noted tell me all.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> replied to him: <q>O paladin,
<lb/>The chief of paladins, the warriors' stay !
<lb/>First swear an oath whereat the land shall quake
<lb/>That thou wilt never injure me or mine.
<lb/>I have a palace, wealth, and mighty kindred.
<lb/>First reassure me and I will reply
<milestone unit="vullers" n="203"/>
<lb/>In hope to win thy favour, and will send

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> grasped
<lb/>Her hand and took the oath, on hearing which,
<lb/>And marking that his speech and pledge were frank,
<lb/>She kissed the ground, then rose and told him all:
<lb/><q>My race is from Zakhak, O paladin!
<lb/>Spouse to <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>, that ardent warrior,
<lb/>Am I, and mother of moon-faced <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Of her o'er whom <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> poureth out his soul.
<lb/>We and our kin before all-holy God
<lb/>Bless all night long the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, and thee, and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>.
<lb/>I come to know thy will, and how thou holdest

<lb/>And sinners all unfit for rule, behold !

<lb/>But as for all the guiltless of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Burn not their hearts nor turn their days to darkness.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The paladin on hearing saw in her
<lb/>A woman of counsel and of ardent soul,
<lb/>With cheeks like spring, in height a cypress-tree,
<lb/>With reed-like waist and pheasant's gait. He said :—
<lb/><q>My pledge shall hold although it cost my life.
<lb/>Live safely and rejoicing at <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>With all thy kindred. I assent that <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>Shall wed <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>. Though our race is other
<lb/>Than yours, yet ye deserve the crown and throne;
<lb/>The world so waggeth and no shame to us;
<lb/>We cannot strive against the Almighty Maker,
<lb/>Who doth whate'er He willeth in such wise
<lb/>That we are ever crying out: <q>Ah me!</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="204"/>
<lb/>One is exalted and another humbled,
<lb/>And while one fareth well another quaketh.
<lb/>The heart of one is furnished by his increase,
<lb/>Another's minished by his poverty,
<lb/>But after all the end of both is dust—
<lb/>The element that slayeth every race.
<lb/>I will exert myself on thy behalf
<lb/>Because of thine appeal and bitter cry,
<lb/>And have already written to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>A letter with the plaint of one in pain,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> hath gone with it. Hath gone! nay rather
<lb/>Hath flown! He saw no saddle when he mounted,
<lb/>And then his roadster's hoofs saw not the ground !
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> will smile and give a gracious answer,
<lb/>For this bird's fosterling is out of heart ;
<lb/>He standeth in the mire made by his tears,
<lb/>And if his sweetheart is as fond as he is
<lb/>Their skins will never hold them. Prithee now
<lb/>Let me behold the <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s child, just once,
<pb n="305"/>
<lb/>On thine own terms. The sight may weigh with me
<lb/>If both her looks and locks commend themselves.</q>
<lb/>She answered: <q>If the paladin will gladden
<lb/>His slave, let him vouchsafe to visit her:
<lb/>Her head will reach high heaven. If to <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>We bring a king like thee, we will present
<lb/>Our lives as offerings.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She saw his smiles
<lb/>And that all hate was rooted from his heart
<lb/>As he replied: <q>Be not concerned ; this matter
<lb/>Will shortly turn out to thy wish.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName>
<lb/>Then asking leave withdrew, and went away

<milestone unit="vullers" n="205"/>
<lb/>She sent a lusty courier like wind
<lb/>To tell <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>: <q>Be easy in thy mind,

<lb/>I follow quickly.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Next day, when the sun

<lb/>Saluted as the Moon of noble dames,
<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> proceeded to the court of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Did him obeisance, spake with him at large,
<lb/>And asked permission to go home rejoicing
<lb/>To tell <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> about the new-made league,
<lb/>And get all ready to receive their guest.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> said: <q>Depart and tell him everything.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They chose choice gifts for her and for <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And for <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> too—that lovesome maid.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> gave <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> withal all that was his

<lb/>Then took her hand, re-swore his oath and said :—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="208"/>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> called <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> to prove him by hard questions.
<lb/>The shrewd archmages and the men of lore
<lb/>Sat in full conclave, and examined him
<lb/>On many matters veiled in mystery.
<lb/>One asked that man of insight, wit, and knowledge :—
<lb/><q>What are the dozen cypresses erect
<lb/>In all their bravery and loveliness,
<lb/>Fach one of them with thirty boughs bedeckt—
<lb/>In <placeName><placeName>Persia</placeName></placeName> never more and never less?</q>
<lb/>The second said: <q>O noble youth! explain—
<lb/>What are those two steeds moving rapidly:
<lb/>As crystal bright is this one of the twain
<lb/>And that one sable as a pitchy sea;
<lb/>They gallop at their utmost speed and strain
<lb/>Each one to catch the other, but in vain ?</q>
<lb/>The third said thus: <q>What are the thirty men
<lb/>Who ride before their king in order meet
<lb/>And seem but twenty-nine to thee, but when
<lb/>Thou countest them their number is complete ?</q>
<lb/>The fourth inquired: <q>What is the meadow-land,
<lb/>Where streams abound and herbage groweth strong,
<lb/>To which a fierce man cometh, in whose hand
<lb/>There is a scythe, a sharp one and a long:
<lb/>He cutteth all the grass both green and dry,
<lb/>And if thou criest heareth not thy cry?</q>
<lb/><q>What are those cypresses—a lofty pair—
<lb/>Like reeds above a sea whose waters heave,</q>
<lb/>Another asked, <q>and what bird nesteth there
<lb/>On this at morning, and on that at eve?
<lb/>The bird departeth and the leaves turn pale,
<lb/>The bird arriveth and they musk exhale.
<pb n="309"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="209"/>
<lb/>In all their verdure both are never seen
<lb/>Together, but one sere, the other green.</q>
<lb/>The sixth said: <q>On a mountain I descried
<lb/>A city that was strongly fortified.
<lb/>The citizens, those men exceeding wise,
<lb/>Preferred thereto a thornbrake on the waste;
<lb/>And there as monarchs or as subjects placed
<lb/>A town with buildings lifted to the skies.
<lb/>The memory of the city now hath gone,
<lb/>'tis not accounted of by any one;
<lb/>But some day suddenly the earth will quake,
<lb/>The country vanish from the sight of men,
<lb/>Remembrance of the city will awake,
<lb/>And long regret possess the citizen.
<lb/>Now look behind the veil, explore the words,
<lb/>And if thou canst the secret sense unfold,
<lb/>Declare it here in presence of the lords, .
<lb/>And make the purest musk from grimy mould.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><head>How <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> answered the Archmages</head>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> for a while remained absorbed in thought,
<lb/>Then shook his plumage, spread his wings, and answered :—
<lb/><q>First as to those twelve cypresses which rear
<lb/>Themselves, with thirty boughs upon each tree:
<lb/>They are the twelve new moons of every year,
<lb/>Like new-made monarchs, throned in majesty.
<lb/>Upon the thirtieth day its course is done
<lb/>For each; thus our revolving periods run.
<lb/>Thou speakest of two chargers, black and white,
<lb/>Which like <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs></rs> go flashing by:
<lb/>These too are periods, and in their flight
<lb/>Pursue each other unremittingly.
<pb n="310"/>
<lb/>The two that pass along are night and day,
<lb/>The pulses of the sky are reckoned so;
<lb/>They never catch each other as they go,
<lb/>But follow as a hound pursueth prey.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="210"/>
<lb/>Again, thou askest of the thirty men
<lb/>That ride before their king in order meet,
<lb/>And seem to thee as twenty-nine, but when
<lb/>Thou countest them their number is complete.
<lb/>They are the phases of the moon; one night
<lb/>A phase from time to time eludeth sight.
<lb/>Unsheathe we now the hidden sense expressed
<lb/>By two tall cypresses, a bird and nest.
<lb/>The darker limb of heaven is opposed
<lb/>With Aries to Libra in the height;
<lb/>Thence till the reign of <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Pisces</rs></rs> hath been closed
<lb/>The ascendant limb is that of gloom and night.
<lb/>Each lofty cypress-tree denoteth one 
<lb/>Of these two limbs which cause our smiles and tears,
<lb/>The bird which flieth 'twixt them is the sun—

<lb/>Again, the city built upon the mount
<lb/>Is our long home, the scene of our account.
<lb/>This Wayside Inn is meant by Thornbrake town,
<lb/>At once our pleasure, treasure, pain and woe:
<lb/>It reckoneth each breath drawn here below
<lb/>And both exalteth us and casteth down.
<note n="1">Putting aside modern astronomical notions the idea seems some- what as follows: the sky, as represented by the Signs of the Zodiac, is divided into a lighter and a darker portion or <term>limb</term>; the lighter,
<lb/>Spring and Summer, being represented by the Signs from Aries to
<lb/>Virgo; and the darker, Autumn and Winter, by those from Libra to
<lb/><rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Pisces</rs></rs>. The <term>limbs</term> are alternately more or less in evidence, while the sun is continually journeying from one <term>limb</term> to the other. The double alternation of light and darkness is thus accounted for; that of the lighter and darker seasons of the year by the movements of the sky, and that of day and night by the movement of the sun. The former rules man's destiny, the latter chiefly influences his daily life.</note>

<lb/>A storm ariseth, earth's foundations quake,

<lb/>We leave our toils behind us in the brake
<lb/>And seek the city that is built on high.
<lb/>Where we have toiled another hath the gain,
<lb/>But not for ever: he will not remain.
'Twas always so; to look for change is vain.
<lb/>If our provision be an honoured name
<lb/>Our souls will be on that account held dear,

<lb/>But if we do the deeds of greed and shame

<lb/>Our mansion we shall have a shroud instead,

<lb/>Who cutteth all alike, both dry and green,
<lb/>And if thou criest heareth not thy cry—
<lb/>Time is the mower; we are like the swath;
<lb/>The grandsire and the grandson are the same

<lb/>The use and process of the world are so:

<lb/>He had forthwith a banquet-hall prepared,
<pb n="312"/>
<lb/>As 'twere the moon at full, and there they quaffed
<lb/>Wine till the night fell, and the revellers' heads
<lb/>Became bemused. Then at the portal rose
<lb/>Shouts for the steeds, and glorious in their cups
<lb/>The warriors grasped hands and went their ways.</p>

<lb/>And when the chiefs awoke, <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, ready-girt
<lb/>And lion-like, approached the royal presence
<lb/>For leave to hie him home, and thus he said :—
<lb/><q>My gracious lord! I long to see <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s face.
<lb/>Since I have kissed the footings of thy throne
<lb/>Of ivory thy <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> and crown illume

<p><lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> said: <q>Youthful warrior!
<lb/>Thou must bestow upon us still one day.
<lb/>Thou yearnest for the daughter of <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>And not for <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade to carry gongs
<lb/>With <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> bells and clarions to the ground,
<lb/>And all the warriors went forth rejoicing
<lb/>With lances, maces, and artillery.
<lb/>They took their bows and poplar shafts and let
<lb/>A mark stand for the foe. They wheeled and showed
<lb/>Their horsemanship with mace, sword, shaft, and lance,
<lb/>While from a height the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, seen or unseen
<lb/>By them, observed their skill, but never saw
<lb/>Or heard of horsemanship like <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s. There stood
<lb/>Upon the ground an ancient tree. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> took
<lb/>His bow, urged on his steed, and raised his name
<lb/>By striking that tall tree and piercing it
<lb/>Full in the centre with the royal shaft.
<lb/>Then certain of the javelin-men took bucklers
<lb/>And exercised with double-headed darts.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> bade his <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> slave bring shields of hide,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="213"/>
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> said to the chiefs: <q>What mighty man
<lb/>Will challenge him to prove his weight in combat ?
<lb/>He hath knocked dust out of two-headed darts
<lb/>And arrows.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then the warriors donned their mail
<lb/>With wrathful hearts and curses on their tongues.
<lb/>They pricked forth to the combat bearing spears
<lb/>With heads of tempered steel. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> urged his steed,
<lb/>Made the dust fly, and, when the battle joined,
<lb/>Selected from the rest a cavalier
<lb/>Of fame and high estate at whom he charged,
<lb/>The warrior turned and fled. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, leopard-like,
<lb/>Emerging from the dust, seized on his belt
<lb/>And took him from his saddle with such ease
<lb/>That both the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> and army were astound,
<lb/>The chiefs exclaiming: <q>None will see his peer.</q>
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> said: <q>May he ever be thus ardent.
<lb/>The mother of the man that dareth him
<lb/>To battle will wear mourning for her son.
<lb/>The lionesses bear not one so brave,

<p><lb/>He praised the youth,

<lb/>The kindness of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> which had produced

<p><lb/>The messenger sped forth. <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> on hearing
<lb/>So joyed to make <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>'s Sun his affine

<pb n="315"/>
<lb/>With smiling lips and joyful heart he called
<lb/>High-born <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> and beaming said to her :—

<lb/>Thy counsel hath illumed our gloomy dwelling.
<lb/>Thou hast laid hand upon a sprout whereto
<lb/>The monarchs of the world will do obeisance.
<lb/>Since thou hast ordered matters from the first

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> on this withdrew and gave her daughter

<lb/>She said: <q>Thy choice of partner is most fit,
<lb/>And men and women, howsoever strict,
<lb/>Will see good cause to let their strictures cease.
<lb/>Thou hast sped quickly to thy heart's desire.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> answered: <q>Consort of the king!
<lb/>Thou meritest the praise of every one.
<lb/>I make the dust upon thy feet my pillow,
<lb/>And order my religion by thy teaching.
<lb/>May eyes of <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahrimans</rs></rs> be far from thee,
<lb/>And be thy heart and soul the house of feasting.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> on hearing this bedecked the palace,

<lb/>Arrayed the hall like jocund Paradise,
<lb/>Mixed wine and musk and ambergris and spread
<lb/>Gold-broidered carpets, some inwoven with emeralds
<lb/>And others patterned out in lustrous pearls ;
<lb/>Each several pearl was like a water-drop.
<lb/>She placed a golden throne within the hall,
<lb/>So do they use in <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>. The tracery
<lb/>Was all of gems with carvings interspersed,
<lb/>The feet were jewelled: 'twas a royal throne

<lb/>Blithe-hearted and in great content, began

<lb/>And kept his countenance: <q>A woman named

<lb/>And made me promise not to be her foe.

<lb/>Shall have the Beauty of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> to wife,

<lb/><q>All things are ready, scented and adorned.</q>
<lb/>What answer shall we send high-born <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> blushed ruby-red from head to foot
<lb/>With sudden joy, and said: <q>O paladin!
<lb/>If it seem good to thee send on the troops
<lb/>And let us follow and discuss the matter.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> smiled at <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, aware of his desire,
<lb/>For he could talk of nothing but <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And got no sleep at nights for thinking of her.</p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> bade to sound the gongs and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> bells
<lb/>And have prepared the royal tent-enclosure.
<lb/>He sent a cameleer, a valiant man,
<lb/>To advertise the lion-like <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>The chieftain is upon his way with <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>And elephants and troops escorting them.</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="218"/>
<p><lb/>He went with speed and told <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>, who joyed;
<lb/>His cheeks grew ruddy as the cercis-bloom.
<lb/>He sounded trumpets, mounted kettledrums,
<lb/>And furnished forth his army like the eye
<lb/>Of chanticleer. Huge elephants and minstrels
<lb/>Made earth a Paradise from end to end.
<lb/>What with the many flags of painted silk
<lb/>Of divers colours, sound of pipes and harps,
<lb/>The blast of trumpets and the din of gongs,
<lb/>One would have said: <q>It is a festival,
<lb/>The Resurrection or the Last Great Day.</q>
<lb/>Thus went <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> till he encountered <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>He then dismounted and approached on foot.
<lb/>That paladin of paladins embraced him
<lb/>And asked if all were well. Muihrab began
<lb/>To compliment both <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, then like
<lb/>The 1.ew moon rising o'er the mountain-tops
<lb/>He riounted his fleet steed and set a crown
<lb/>Of gold and jewels on the head of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>.

<lb/>What with the clang of <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> bells, the sounds

<lb/><q>The roofs and doors make music, Times are changed !</q>
<lb/>The horses' manes and forelocks ran with saffron
<lb/>And musk. Then with three hundred female slaves
<lb/>With girded loins, each with a cup of gold
<lb/>Which brimmed with musk and gems, <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> approached,

<lb/><q>How long wilt thou conceal <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> thus?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> replied: <q>If thou wouldst see the Sun
<lb/>What is my fee?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> answered: <q>What thou wilt:
<lb/>My treasures, crown, throne, country—all are thine.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They sought the chamber arabesqued with gold,
<lb/>Where all was jocund Spring, and <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, entranced,
<lb/>Struck dumb, and dazzled, viewed the moon-faced maid.
<lb/>At last he said to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>: <q>Thou lucky youth!
<lb/>God greatly helped thee when this glorious Sun
<lb/>Set her affections on thy face. Thy Choice
<lb/>Is choice indeed!</q></p>
<p><lb/>By <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s desire <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>Approached to execute the legal contract.
<lb/>They placed the happy couple on one throne
<lb/>And scattered emeralds and carnelians.
<lb/>Her coronet was wrought of gold and his

<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> was confounded when he realised

<lb/>Then going to the palace from the hall
<lb/>They spent three weeks in joy, while all the nobles

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><head>The Story of the Birth of <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/>Ere long the noble Cypress was in bearing,
<lb/>Delightsome Spring grew sere, her heart was sad,
<lb/>She wept blood for the burden that she bore.
<lb/>Gone was her cercis-bloom, her cheeks were saffron.
<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> said unto her: <q>Life of thy mother!
<lb/>Why hast thou grown so wan?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> answered :—
<lb/><q>By night and day I cry for help. I lie
<lb/>Sleepless and withered like a living corpse.
<lb/>My time hath come but not deliverance.</q>
<lb/>Until that came she lacked both rest and sleep.
<lb/>One would have said: <q>Her skin is stuffed with stones
<lb/>Or iron.</q> Now one day she swooned, and shrieks
<lb/>Rose from the halls of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>. <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> bewailed,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="222"/>
<lb/>Plucked out her raven tresses musk-perfumed
<lb/>And tore her face. Then one announced to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>The leaves have withered on thy lofty Cypress,</q>
<lb/>And he with tearful cheeks and stricken heart
<lb/>Approached the couch whereon <persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName> lay.
<lb/>The female slaves were tearing out their hair
<lb/>Unveiled with tearful faces. Then occurred
<lb/>A thought to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> which eased him of his anguish—
<lb/>The plume of the <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs>.<ref target="n.1"/> He smiling told
<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName>, then brought a censer, kindled fire
<lb/>And burnt some of the plume. The air grew dark
<lb/>And that imperious bird swooped down—a Cloud
<lb/>Whose drops were pearls . . . pearls, say I, rather peace.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> did obeisance long and praised her much.
<lb/>She thus addressed him: <q>Wherefore is this grief,
<lb/>This moisture in the mighty Lion's eye ?
<note n="1">Cf. pp. 235, 246.</note>
<pb n="321"/>
<lb/>From this moon-faced and silver-bosomed Cypress
<lb/>Will come a noble babe. The mighty lion
<lb/>Will kiss the dust upon his feet. No cloud
<lb/>Will dare to pass above him. When he shouteth
<lb/>The pard will split its skin and gnaw its paws.
<lb/>The warriors that see his whizzing mace,
<lb/>His chest, his arms and neck, will hear his voice
<lb/>With quaking hearts, steel-eaters though they be
<lb/>And gallant fighters; for this child will prove
<lb/>In counsels and in rede a weighty <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,

<lb/>Two miles. His birth will not be natural,
<lb/>So willeth He who giveth good. Bring thou
<lb/>A blue-steel dagger, seek a cunning man,
<lb/>Bemuse the lady first with wine to ease
<lb/>Her pain and fear, then let him ply his craft
<lb/>And take the Lion from its lair by piercing
<lb/>Her waist while all unconscious, thus imbruing
<lb/>Her side in blood, and then stitch up the gash.
<lb/>Put trouble, care, and fear aside, and bruise
<lb/>With milk and musk a herb that I will show thee
<lb/>And dry them in the shade. Dress and anoint
<lb/><persName><persName>Rudaba</persName></persName>'s wound and watch her come to life.
<lb/>Rub o'er the wound my plume, its gracious shade
<lb/>Will prove a blessing. Let this gladden thee.
<lb/>Then go before the Lord who hath bestowed
<lb/>This royal Tree which ever blossometh
<lb/>Good fortune. Be not troubled for this matter,
<lb/>Because thy fertile Bough will yield thee fruit.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She spake, and plucking from her wing a plume
<lb/>Dropped it and flew aloft. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> picked it up
<lb/>And did, O marvel! as the bird had said,
<lb/>While every one looked on amazedly
<lb/>With wounded spirit and with bloodshot eyes.
<pb n="322"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName> wept tears of blood in torrents, asking :—
<lb/><q>How shall the infant come forth through the side?</q></p>
<p><lb/>There came an archimage, one deft of hand,
<lb/>Who made the moon-faced dame bemused with wine,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="224"/>
<lb/>Then pierced her side while she was all unconscious,
<lb/>And having turned the infant's head aright
<lb/>Delivered her uninjured. None had seen
<lb/>A thing so strange. The babe was like a lion,
<lb/>A hero tall and fair to look upon,
<lb/>Both men and women wondered at hitn, none
<lb/>Had heard of such an elephantine child.
<lb/>A day and night the mother lay asleep,
<lb/>Bemused, unconscious. They the while sewed up
<lb/>The wound and eased the anguish with the dressing.
<lb/>When she awoke and whispered to <persName><persName>Sindukht</persName></persName>
<lb/>They showered gold and jewels over her
<lb/>And praised the Almighty. Then they brought the babe
<lb/>To her, extolling him as heavenly,
<lb/>The first day thou hadst called him twelve months old—
<lb/>A very heap of lilies mixed with tulips.
<lb/>The lofty Cypress smiled upon the babe,
<lb/>Perceived in him the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> of king of kings,
<lb/>And, <q>I am magnified,</q> she said, <q>and grief
<lb/>Is over.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So they named the infant <q><persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>.</q> <ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>They made of silk a herolet the size
<lb/>Of that unsuckled Lion, stuffing it
<lb/>With sable's hair and limning Sol and <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs></rs>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="225"/>
<lb/>Upon the cheeks, with dragons on the arms,
<lb/>And on the hands a lion's claws. Beneath
<lb/>The arm there was a spear, mace in one hand
<lb/>And bridle in the other. They set the puppet
<lb/>Upon a chestnut horse with great attendance.
<note n="1"> The word in the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs></rs> may also mean <q>Je suis délivrée</q> (Mohl), or <gloss>I bear fruit</gloss>, lit., <gloss>There is fruit to me</gloss>.</note>
<pb n="323"/>
<lb/>This done they sent on first a cameleer
<lb/>Apace, showered drachms on those who were in charge,
<lb/>And took the puppet mace in hand to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>In all the country round they held high revel,
<lb/>The desert was supplied with pipe and wine.
<lb/>Inside <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName> <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> enjoyed the tidings
<lb/>And showered dinars upon the mendicants,
<lb/>While in <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName> the revellers sat together
<lb/>Without distinction as to high and low,
<lb/>But mixed like warp and woof.</p>
<p><lb/>They brought the puppet
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the cavalier, who looked thereon,
<lb/>Grew glad and well content. That hero's hair
<lb/>Stood up on end. <q>This silken thing,</q> said he,
<lb/><q>Is just like me. If he is half this size
<lb/>His head will touch the sky, his skirt the ground.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He called the messenger and poured drachms o'er him
<lb/>Until the heap was level with his head.
<lb/>The drums beat in the court for joy, <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> decked
<lb/>The champaign like the eye of chanticleer
<lb/>Aud bade adorn the land of the Sagsars
<milestone unit="vullers" n="226"/>
<lb/>And all <placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName>. He had wine brought,
<lb/>Called minstrels and showered drachms on mendicants,
<lb/>A week passed and the famous chieftain wrote
<lb/>A letter like the meads of Paradise
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>. He offered praises first to God
<lb/>That matters had turned out so happily,
<lb/>Praised <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> the lord of mace and scimitar,
<lb/>Then coming to the effigy of silk,
<lb/>Which had a hero's neck and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> of kings,
<lb/>Enjoined: <q>So cherish him that not a breath
<lb/>May hurt him. I have prayed by day and night
<lb/>In secret to Almighty God to show me
<lb/>A son born of thy seed and of my type.
<pb n="324"/>
<lb/>Now that the backs of both of us are straightened
<lb/>We only need to pray that we may live.</q>
<lb/>Came like a rushing wind the messenger
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> of ardent and exulting heart,
<lb/>Told him of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s delight and gave the letter.
<lb/>As soon as <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> had heard those pleasant words,
<lb/>Which caused the clear-brained hero added joy,
<lb/>He raised his neck to touch the azure sky.
<lb/>Thus went the world with <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and showed its purpose.
<lb/>Ten nurses suckled <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, for from milk
<lb/>Are strength and constitution. Being weaned
<lb/>He lived on bread and flesh. He ate as much
<lb/>As five, and people turned from such repasts.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="227"/>
<lb/>When <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> had attained the height of eight <ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>And grown a noble Cypress or bright Star—
<lb/>A Star whereat the world was all agaze—
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>'Tis valiant <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> indeed
<lb/>In stature, wisdom, countenance, and rede.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><head>How <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> came to see <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName></head>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> heard: <q>The son of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> is like a lion,
<lb/>None ever saw a child so fierce and stalwart.</q>
<lb/>His heart was stirred in him, and he resolved
<lb/>Himself to see the boy. He left in charge
<lb/>The captain of the host and went with escort,
<lb/>Drawn by his love, toward <placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>Then earth grew ebon, for <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> heard the news,
<lb/>Bound on the drums and went with brave <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>To welcome <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>. When <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> had dropped the ball
<lb/>Shouts of departure rose on every side.
<note n="1"><persName><persName>Firdausi</persName></persName> does not specify the measure. Mohl translates <gloss>huit palmes</gloss>.</note>

<lb/>The mass of men stretched out from hill to hill,
<lb/>With buckler after buckler red and yellow.
<lb/>Then trumpeted the elephant and neighed
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> steed, five miles that din resounded.
<lb/>They had one mighty elephant caparisoned
<lb/>And furnished with a golden throne, whereon
<lb/>The son of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> sat with his cypress-form,
<lb/>And what a neck and shoulders! crowned and girt,
<lb/>With bow and shafts in hand, and shield before him.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="228"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> saw and ranked his troops upon each side.
<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> dismounted, and the elders
<lb/>Fell prostrate, calling blessings down on <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Whose face bloomed like a rose. With gladdened heart
<lb/>He smiled to see the child so strongly built—
<lb/>A lion's whelp upon an elephant.
<lb/>He had them brought just as they were, surveyed
<lb/>The boy thus crowned and throned, and blessed him, saying :—
<lb/><q>Live long and happily, thou matchless Lion.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> kissed <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s throne and, wonderful
<lb/>To tell! saluted him in this new fashion :—
<lb/><q>Great paladin! rejoice. I am thine offshoot:
<lb/>Be thou my root. The slave of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> am I,
<lb/>But am not one for banquet, dream, and ease,
<lb/>I would have steed and saddle, mail and helm,
<lb/>Despatch my compliments by bolt and arrow,
<lb/>And by God's bidding trample on foes' heads.
<lb/>My face is like to thine, so be my courage.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He lighted. <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the chieftain grasped his hand
<lb/>And kissed his head and eyes. Meanwhile the tymbals
<lb/>And elephants were still. Then full of glee
<milestone unit="vullers" n="229"/>
<lb/>And talk they all betook them to the palace
<lb/>And revelled merrily on golden seats,
<lb/>Thus resting for a month with harp and song.
<lb/>Upon the throne there sat victorious <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<pb n="326"/>
<lb/>An eagle's feather drooping from his crown,
<lb/>Flanked by his son and <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> mace in hand,
<lb/>On whom the grandsire gazed amazedly,
<lb/>Invoked o'er him the name of God and thought :—
<lb/><q>With such aneck and arms, such thews and shoulders,
<lb/>Such reed-like waist, such ample chest and breast,
<lb/>Such thighs like those of mighty dromedaries,
<lb/>Such lon's heart and lion-tiger might,
<lb/>Such goodly features, neck, and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>, he hath
<lb/>No peer on earth,</q> then said to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>: <q>Although
<lb/>Thou question back a hundred generations,
<lb/>No one would know of babe delivered thus.
<lb/>How could they do the thing successfully ?
<lb/>A thousand times may that <rs type="title"><rs type="title">Simurgh</rs></rs> be blest
<lb/>To whom God showed the way. Now let us revel on
<lb/>And put to flight with wine the soul of care,
<lb/>For this world is a caravanserail,
<lb/>Old guests depart and new ones take their places.</q>
<lb/>They put the wine about and grew bemused,
<lb/>They drank the chieftain's health, then that of <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>.
<lb/><persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName> kept quaffing till he thought himself
<lb/>The one man of the world. <q>Ido not care

<lb/>I, <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, and my steed Shabdiz, and sword...

<lb/>And make the dust beneath my feet pure musk.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="230"/>
<lb/>And now to find him arms.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He spake in jest,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> were merry at his words.</p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, when the month was o'er, one day at dawn
<lb/>Returned to his own throne. He said to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>My son! be just and loyal to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shahs</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Preferring wisdom over wealth, refraining
<lb/>Thy hands from evil all thy years, and seeking
<pb n="327"/>
<lb/>God's way from day to day. Know that in public
<lb/>And private also 'tis the one thing needful
<lb/>Because the world will not abide with any.
<lb/>Observe my rede and walk in righteous ways.
<lb/>My heart forebodeth that my time hath come.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade his children both farewell and said :—
<lb/><q>Forget not mine advice.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then in the palace
<lb/>The bells rang out, and on the elephants
<lb/>The clarions blared, as with his gentle tongue
<lb/>And kindly heart <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> journeyed toward the west.
<lb/>His children bore him company three stages
<lb/>With minds instructed and with tearful cheeks,
<lb/>Then <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> went on while <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> marched to <placeName><placeName>Sistan</placeName></placeName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="231"/>
<lb/>And there in lion <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s company
<lb/>Spent day and night in bout and revelry.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><head>How <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> slew the White Elephant</head>
<p><lb/>It came to pass that as they spent a day
<lb/>In revel in a garden with their friends,
<lb/>While harp-strings ran the gamut of sweet sounds
<lb/>And all the chiefs were one in merriment,
<lb/>They quafted red wine from crystal cups until
<lb/>Their heads were dazed, and then <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> bade his son :—
<lb/><q>My child of sun-like <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>! make ready robes
<lb/>Of honour for thy warriors, and steeds
<lb/>For those of high degree.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> gave
<lb/>Gold, many <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> steeds caparisoned
<lb/>And other gifts, and all went richer home,
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, as his wont was, sought the bower, while <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Reeled to his chamber, laid him down and slept.
<pb n="328"/>
<lb/>Shouts rose outside his door: <q>The chief's white elephant
<lb/>Hath broken loose, and folk are in its danger!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He heard, and urged by hardihood ran forth,
<lb/>Snatched up <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>'s mace and made toward the street.
<lb/>The keepers of the gate opposed him, saying :—
<lb/><q>We fear the chieftain, 'tis a darksome night,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="232"/>
<lb/>The elephant is loose! Who can approve
<lb/>Thy going forth ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Wroth at the speaker's words
<lb/>The matchless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> smote him on the nape:
<lb/>His head rolled from him, <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> turned toward
<lb/>The others but they fled the paladin,
<lb/>Who boldly went up to the gate and smashed
<lb/>The chains and bolts with blows that well befitted
<lb/>One of such noble name, went forth like wind
<lb/>With shouldered mace excitedly, approached
<lb/>The mighty beast and roared out like the sea.
<lb/>He looked and saw a Mountain bellowing,
<lb/>The ground beneath it like a boiling pot,
<lb/>Saw his own nobles fleeing in dismay,
<lb/>Like sheep that spy a wolf, roared like a lion
<lb/>And went courageously against the beast,
<lb/>Which seeing him charged at hin like a mountain
<lb/>And reared its trunk to strike, but <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> dealt it
<lb/>A mace-blow on the head; the mountain-form
<lb/>Stooped; <placeName><placeName>Mount Bistun</placeName></placeName> shook to its core and tumbled
<lb/>At one blow vile and strengthless. Thus it fell,
<lb/>That bellowing elephant, while matchless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Went lightly to his place again and slept.</p>
<p><lb/>Now when the sun ascended from the east,
<lb/>Bright as the cheeks of those who ravish hearts,
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> heard of <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s deeds, how he had knocked
<lb/>The dust out of the roaring elephant,
<lb/>Had with a single mace-blow broken its neck
<pb n="329"/>
<lb/>And cast its body to the ground. He cried :—
<lb/><q>Woe for that mighty elephant, which used
<lb/>To bellow like the dark blue sea! How often
<milestone unit="vullers" n="233"/>
<lb/>Hath that strong beast charged and o'erthrown a host,
<lb/>Yet conquer howsoe'er it might in battle
<lb/>My son hath bested it!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He summoned <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Kissed him upon his head and hands and neck,
<lb/>And said: <q>O lion's whelp! thy claws have grown
<lb/>And thou art brave indeed! Youth as thou art
<lb/>Thou hast no peer in stature, <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>, and valour ;
<lb/>So ere thy spreading fame shall thwart thine action
<lb/>Take vengeance for the blood of Narfman.
<lb/>Speed forth to <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName> where thou wilt see
<lb/>A cloud-capt stronghold four leagues square, whereover
<lb/>The eagle hath not soared, 'tis full of herbage
<lb/>And water, gold and money, men and beasts.
<lb/>Both trees and husbandmen abound there; none
<lb/>Hath seen a place like that. The All-Provider
<lb/>Hath furnished workmen of all sorts, and fruit-trees.
<lb/>There is but one approach; 'tis through a gate
<lb/>As high as heaven, and <persName><persName>Nariman</persName></persName>, who bore
<lb/>The ball from all the chiefs, approached the stronghold
<lb/>By order of <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> and held
<lb/>The road. The siege went on both night and day
<lb/>With stratagems and spells above a year,
<lb/>Until the foe hurled down a rock and earth
<lb/>Possessed the paladin no more. The host
<milestone unit="vullers" n="234"/>
<lb/>Retreated to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>. When <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> was told :—
<lb/><q>The valiant Lion hath had fight enough,</q>
<lb/>He wailed with growing grief, and having mourned
<lb/>A week in anguish called the host together.
<lb/>He marched against that hold with troops that covered
<lb/>The waste and desert, and for months and years
<lb/>Beleaguered it in vain. None issued forth
<pb n="330"/>
<lb/>And none went in, but though the gate was shut
<lb/>So long the foe lacked not a stalk of hay,
<lb/>And <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> forewent his vengeance in despair.
<lb/>Now is the time, my son! for artifice.
<lb/>Go with a caravan in merry pin,
<lb/>So that the watchmen may not find thee out,
<lb/>And when thou occupiest <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Destroy those evil-doers, root and stem.
<lb/>Since thou art yet unknown thou mayst succeed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> answered: <q>I will do thy bidding
<lb/>And soon provide a physic for the ache.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Said <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> to him: <q>My prudent son! give ear.
<lb/>Don camel-drivers' clothes and from the plain
<lb/>Fetch camels to make up a caravan.
<lb/>Disguise thyself and carry naught but salt,
<lb/>For that is precious there. The folk know nothing
<lb/>Of greater value. Though the castle towereth
<lb/>Above its gate they have no salt to eat,
<lb/>So all will run to greet thee when they see
<lb/>Loads of it coming unexpectedly.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><head>How <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> went to <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName></head>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> made him ready for the fray,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="235"/>
<lb/>Concealed his mace within a load of salt
<lb/>And took some wise and valiant men withal.
<lb/>He hid the arms within the camels' loads
<lb/>And merry at the artifice sped on
<lb/>To <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName>. When he arrived the watchman
<lb/>Saw him and hastened to the castellan.
<lb/><q>A caravan,</q> be said, <q>with many drivers
<lb/>Hath come, and if my lord doth ask their business,
<lb/>To me it seemeth that they carry salt.</q></p>
<pb n="331"/>
<p><lb/>The chief sent one in haste to learn their loading,
<lb/>Who went like dust to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> and inquired :—
<lb/><q>O master of the caravan! inform me
<lb/>What merchandise is hidden in thy packs,
<lb/>That I may go and tell the castellan
<lb/>And take his orders.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> answered him :—
<lb/><q>Go to the noble castellan and say:
<lb/><q>They carry salt.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The messenger returned
<lb/>And said: <q>They carry salt alone, my lord!</q></p>
<p><lb/>The chief rose, glad and smiling, bade his men
<lb/>Unbar the gate and let the strangers in.
<lb/>So battle-loving <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> with his folk
<lb/>Approached the gate whence people hurried out
<lb/>To welcome him. He kissed the ground before
<lb/>The chieftain, paid him many compliments,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="236"/>
<lb/>Gave him much salt and spake fair words all round.
<lb/>The chieftain said to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>: <q>Live for ever.
<lb/>Be as the sun and as the shining moon.
<lb/>I both accept and thank thee, worthy youth !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Young <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> entered the bazar and took
<lb/>His caravan. The people flocked about him ;
<lb/>One gave a robe, another gold and silver,
<lb/>And chaffered with him unsuspectingly.
<lb/>At night brave <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> and his warriors,
<lb/>Armed for the fray, made for the castellan,
<lb/>Who strove against them, but the Matchless one
<lb/>Struck him a mace-blow on the head, and buried
<lb/>His head and crown in dust. The tidings spread,
<lb/>The people hastened to oppose the foe,
<lb/>Night gloomed, blades flashed, and earth was like the ruby.
<lb/>What with the mellay and the waves of blood
<lb/>One would have said: <q>A sunset sky hath fallen.</q>
<pb n="332"/>
<lb/>The peerless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> with his lasso, mace,
<lb/>And sword destroyed the gallant foe; and when
<lb/>The sun unveiled itself, and held the world
<lb/>From earth to Pleiades, of all the garrison
<lb/>Not one remained alive that was not wounded.
<lb/>The brave <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></rs> entered every nook
<lb/>And slaughtered all they found. The matchless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Saw in the citadel where room was scant
<lb/>A building of hard stone with iron doors,
<lb/>And having with his mace-blows shattered them
<milestone unit="vullers" n="237"/>
<lb/>He entered and beheld a lofty vault
<lb/>Full of dinars. Astonied at the sight
<lb/>He bit his lip; then to his chiefs he said :—
<lb/><q>Who ever would have thought of such a thing?
<lb/>Good sooth no gold remaineth in the mines,
<lb/>Or any pearl or jewel in the sea ;
<lb/>They lie out-spread within this treasury.</q></p></div>

<p><lb/><q>I came to <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>By thy behest, and what a mount was there!

<pb n="333"/>
<lb/>There came a greeting from the castellan,
<lb/>And though I did according to his bidding
<lb/>All things turned out as I would have thein be.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="238"/>
<lb/>At night-time with my famous men of war
<lb/>I gave scant respite to the garrison,
<lb/>Who have been slain or maimed or have escaped
<lb/>By throwing all their fighting-gear away.
<lb/>There are in sooth five hundred thousand loads
<lb/>Of silver ingots and of standard gold.
<lb/>Of raiment, tapestries, and movables
<lb/>No one could tell the total though he counted
<lb/>For days and months. What would the paladin ?
<lb/>May his steps prosper, may his mind be bright.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The messenger came like a blast and gave
<lb/>The letter to the paladin. That chieftain -
<lb/>Read and exclaimed: <q>Praise to those noble ones.</q>
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The news will make him young.</q>
<lb/>He wrote a full reply, first praising God

<lb/>Whenas the letter came to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> his cheeks

<lb/><q>Jt is not wonderful that lions' whelps
<lb/>Prove brave. A clever archimage may take
<lb/>One ere it suck and bring it up with men,
<lb/>Yet will he fear it when its teeth have grown,
<lb/>For though it never saw its mother's dugs
<lb/>'Twill throw back to the instincts of its sire.
<lb/>No wonder then that <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> should inherit
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s prowess, and that Lions seek his aid

<p><lb/>He sealed the letter

<lb/>To <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> therewith clad in his robe of honour.
<lb/>The paladin rejoiced at what that youth

the reign is one of disaster for <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>; and the ancient feud, originating in the murder of <persName><persName>Iraj</persName></persName>, receives a new impetus through
the execution of <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName> by his brother <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>. We are

the peculiar possession of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shahs</rs></rs>, and which <persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> himself

a water-stealing fiend; but he cannot be traced further back

<lb/>His royal crown o'er <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs></rs> and gave audience
<lb/>Upon the throne of <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, bestowing
<lb/>Drachms and dinars upon the troops. The nobles
<lb/>Did reverence with their faces in the dust,
<lb/>And said: <q>We are the bondslaves of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Our eyes and hearts are full of love for thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But matters changed, the monarch proved unjust,
<lb/>Laments went up on all sides, and men's heads
<lb/>Were whitened by the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>. He blotted out
<lb/>The customs of his sire and grew severe
<lb/>To chief and archimage, spurned gracious ways
<milestone unit="vullers" n="244"/>
<lb/>And was enslaved to pelf. The peasants rose,
<lb/>Bold spirits claimed the realm, and tumults followed.
<lb/>The unjust <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> in terror wrote to <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Then at <placeName><placeName>Sagsar</placeName></placeName> within <placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And first invoked the Maker of the world,
<lb/>The Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs></rs>, <rs type="heavenlybody"><rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs></rs>, and Sol, who made
<lb/>Both ant and elephant: <q>Naught is beyond

<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, through whom the glorious crown grew bright,

<lb/>And may as many blessings light on <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,

<lb/>May that redoubted glorious chief be sound
<lb/>In heart and mind, and sorrowless in soul.
<lb/>The paladin of earth should know, I ween,

<lb/>All matters close or open. <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Before he closed his eyes, spake much of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And I too have a warm supporter in him,

<p><lb/>Whenas the letter came <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> sighed. At cockcrow
<lb/>The sound of tymbals rose within the court,
<lb/>And from the Kargasirs he marched a host
<lb/>Such that the green sea had been lost therein.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="245"/>
<lb/>The magnates in Irin went out to meet
<lb/>The approaching troops, dismounted when near <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And spake with him at large of all the actions
<lb/>Done by <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName>, and how he was unjust
<lb/>And lett his father's footsteps recklessly.
<lb/><q>He hath made earth a desert,</q> they protested,
<lb/><q>His fortune that was wakeful is asleep.
<lb/>He walketh not in wisdom's way, the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>

<lb/>His fortune would regenerate the world,

<p><lb/>But <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Would God approve? <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName> hath royal blood
<lb/>And sitteth belted on the royal seat.
<lb/>Could I lay hands upon the realm and crown ?
<lb/>Impossible! One should not hear such words.
<lb/>Would any chief dare say this publicly ?

<p><lb/>The chiefs repented and made fealty
<lb/>Afresh ; that prosperous-footed paladin
<lb/>Made earth grow young throughout. When <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> had reached
<lb/>The presence of the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> he kissed the ground.

<lb/>With greetings and unbounded compliments.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="247"/>
<lb/>They feasted for a week with harp and wine,
<lb/>All offered their excuses to <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And bare themselves as subjects. From each province
<lb/>Came tax and tribute out of fear of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The swift of wrath. <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName> sat on the throne
<lb/>In splendour and in undisturbed repose,
<lb/>Till in the presence the chief paladin

<lb/>Threw wide the door of counsel to the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>And told again the goodly histories

<lb/>And <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, the lustre of the throne,
<lb/>And how they ruled earth justly and gave alms

<pb n="342"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> brought the monarch's wayward heart to reason,
<lb/>Warmed the chiefs' hearts toward him, rendering

<lb/>Acceptable, and having said his say
<lb/>Both to the nobles and their sovereign
<lb/>Went with a robe of honour from <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName>,

<lb/>An ocean and his hand a raining cloud.
<lb/><persName><persName>Pashang</persName></persName> commanded him to draw the sword
<lb/>Of war, and lead an army to <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/>A chief whose son is worthy of his name
<lb/>May raise his own head to the orb of day,
<lb/>For afterwards, when he hath passed away.</p>
<p><lb/>The son will keep alive the father's fame.
<lb/><persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>, high-wrought and full of vengeance,
<lb/>Went forth and opening the treasury
<lb/>Abundantly equipped his warriors ;
<lb/>But when all things were ready, <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName>
<lb/>The counsellor, heart-musing, sought his sire,
<lb/>For thinking is the business of the heart,
<lb/>And spake on this wise: <q>Mine experienced father,
<lb/>The highest of the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> race in valour!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="250"/>
<lb/>Although <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> hath now no <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>,
<pb n="344"/>
<lb/><persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>, son of <persName><persName>Nariman</persName></persName>, is general ;
<lb/>There are besides <persName><persName>Kishwad</persName></persName>, the brave <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And other men of name among the folk.
<lb/>Thou know'st what <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> and valiant <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName> endured
<lb/>Through that old wolf and sworder Minuchuhr,
<lb/>And yet <persName><persName>Zadsham</persName></persName>, my grandsire and our king,
<lb/>Whose helmet touched the circle of the moon,
<lb/>ne'er spake a word of such a war, or read
<lb/>The book of vengeance in the time of peace.
<lb/>'Tis better for us to restrain ourselves,
<lb/>Because this madness will confound the realm.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Pashang</persName></persName> said: <q>That brave crocodile, <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Is as a lion on a hunting-day,
<lb/>An elephant of war in battle-tide.
<lb/>Call him a bastard that would not avenge
<lb/>His grandsire's wrongs. Depart forthwith and counsel
<lb/><persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName> in matters great and small.
<lb/>So when the crumple-skirted clouds are gone,
<lb/>When rains have drenched the wastes, when hill and plain
<lb/>Give pasture for the steeds, when herbage riseth
<lb/>Above our warriors' necks and all the world
<lb/>Is green with corn, then camp upon the plain;
<lb/>Midst rose and verdure bear a gladsome heart,
<lb/>And lead the whole host onward to <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName>;
<lb/>Tread <placeName><placeName>Dahistan</placeName></placeName> beneath the horses' hoofs,
<lb/>Speed and incarnadine the streams with blood.
<lb/>Thence <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> departed to the war
<lb/>To take revenge on <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>, thence did his powers
<lb/>Advance against us like a murky cloud,
<lb/>And by that token it is your turn now
<lb/>To send the dust up from their nobles' heads.
<lb/>The refuge of the army of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Was <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName>, and he adorned the throne.

<lb/>An army marched forth from <placeName><placeName>Turan</placeName></placeName> and <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>With mace-men from the Western lands—a host
<lb/>Without a middle or an end; withal
<lb/>The fortune of <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName> was young no longer.
<lb/>As these approached <placeName><placeName>Jihun</placeName></placeName> he heard the news

<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, who loved the fray, was general,

<lb/>The host approaching <placeName><placeName>Dahistan</placeName></placeName> concealed

<p><lb/>The van appeared in front of <placeName><placeName>Dahistan</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>As morn rose o'er the hills. The armies camped
<lb/>Two leagues apart in warlike pomp. A <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs>,
<lb/>By name <persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName>—one who bade sleepers wake—
<lb/>Approached, spied out the whole <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> host
<lb/>And viewed the camp-enclosure of <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName>,

<lb/>Then lowered <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>, ashamed to hear

<lb/><q>Put on thine armour and string up thy bow;

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName> pricked forth and shouted to <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> :—

<lb/>Hast thou a man who will contend with me?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> looked round upon his mighty men
<lb/>For one to volunteer, but none responded
<lb/>Save valiant old <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName>. The prudent chief

<milestone unit="vullers" n="254"/>
<lb/>And wept for wrath, and there was room for it
<lb/>With that great host, that, with so many young
<lb/>To fight, one old man only volunteered.
<lb/>Vexed to the heart about <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName>, <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>
<lb/>Addressed him thus in presence of the chiefs :—
<lb/><q>At thine age thou shouldst not contend with one
<lb/>Fresh, ardent, young, and daring, like <persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who hath a lion's heart, and head sun-high.
<lb/>Thou art an honoured chieftain, and the centre

<p><lb/><rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs></rs> his reply in presence of the troops :—
<lb/><q>The rolling sky hath given me enough.
<lb/>Know, brother! that the body is for death ;
<lb/>My head and neck were meant to wear a helm.
<pb n="348"/>
<lb/>My heart hath been in anguish from the time
<lb/>Of blesséd <persName><persName>Minuchihr</persName></persName> until this day.
<lb/>No mortal passeth into heaven alive,
<lb/>Man is death's quarry; one the scimitar
<lb/>Destroyeth mid the mellay, and the vulture
<lb/>And lion tear his corpse; another's life
<lb/>Is ended on his bed. Beyond all question
<lb/>We must depart, and if I quit the world
<lb/>My tall and lusty brother is still safe.
<lb/>Make me a royal charnel in your love,
<lb/>Give musk, rose-water, camphor for my head,
<lb/>My body to the place of endless sleep.
<lb/>This do, live peacefully, and trust in God.</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="255"/>
<p><lb/>This said, he grasped his spear and sallied forth
<lb/>Like some fierce elephant. Barmin exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>Now hath fate put thy head within my reach.
<lb/>Well hadst thou held aloof, for time itself
<lb/>Would have thy life.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>The sky,</q> <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName> replied,
<lb/><q>Gave me my share long since, and he whose hour

<lb/>That time is not ill-timed at any time.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He spake and urged his sable steed, denying

<lb/>The victory was <persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName>'s, who as he rode
<lb/>Hurled at <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName> a dart which struck his hip

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> the battle-lover, when <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName>

<lb/>The warrior rushed forth and <persName><persName>Garsiwaz</persName></persName>,

<lb/>The chargers neighed, the sun and shining moon

<milestone unit="vullers" n="256"/>
<lb/>Swords diamond-bright and spear-heads steeped in gore
<lb/>Shone mid the dust—dust like a rainy cloud
<lb/>Wherethrough vermilion droppeth from the sun,

<lb/>They fought till night rose o'er the hills, and then
<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> withdrew the host to <placeName><placeName>Dahistan</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>With heart distracted by his brother's death
<lb/>He came to the pavilion of <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Who on beholding him let tears down fall
<lb/>From weary eyelids that had seen no sleep,
<lb/>And said: <q>Since <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the horseman died my soul
<lb/>Hath not grieved thus. Live thou for evermore,
<lb/>And sunlike be the spirit of <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName>.
<lb/>A day of joy and then a day of grief,
<lb/>Such is the wont and fashion of the world!
<lb/>No fostering will rescue us from death ;
<lb/>Earth's only cradle is the sepulchre,</q>
<lb/><q>I have resigned to death,</q> <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> replied,
<lb/><q>My doughty body even from my birth.
<lb/>'Twas <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> that put my helmet on

<lb/>Forthwith or else our wives and little ones

<lb/>Now when these three—Shidtsh, <persName><persName>Kishwad</persName></persName>, <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>—
<lb/>Had taken counsel for the whole emprise,
<lb/>And half the night had passed, they made them ready

<lb/>They reached what men in those days called <q>White

<lb/>There found they Guzhdaham the castellan
<lb/>Together with his watchful warriors
<lb/>Beleaguered by <persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName>, who held the road

<lb/>And made for <placeName><placeName>Pars</placeName></placeName>. The brave <persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName> was ware
<lb/>And like a lion met him on the way.
<lb/>Now when <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> saw mid the dust of fight
<lb/>That man of blood he grappled with his foe,
<lb/>All lion-like, not giving time for ruse,
<lb/>But closed at once, invoking God for succour,

<lb/>Through mail and buckle. From his charger's back
<lb/><persName><persName>Barman</persName></persName> fell headlong, the bright orb of day

<lb/>The foemen ready for a running fight,

<lb/>That wore the crown, They fought all night till noonday,
<lb/>And earth was dark with warriors' dust. At length
<lb/>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> was taken with twelve hundred nobles;

<lb/>It playeth friend and foe, and proffereth thee,
<lb/>At times a kernel and at times a shell ;
<lb/>It is a conjurer that knoweth well

<lb/>Although thy head may touch the clouds, it must

<lb/>Were flung in numbers with him on the route.
<lb/>The sight grieved <persName><persName>Wisa</persName></persName> so that thou hadst said :—

<lb/>Thus like a torrent <persName><persName>Wisa</persName></persName> rushed along

<lb/>Such was the news that reached <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, who sent

<lb/>And followed them himself—the Sun of earth.
<lb/>Now when from <placeName><placeName>Pars</placeName></placeName> he reached the waste, a dust-cloud
<lb/>Appeared upon his left, and from the dust
<lb/>The sable flag emerged, while from the van
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> chief led on his host. Both armies

<milestone unit="vullers" n="266"/>
<lb/>Then from the centre <persName><persName>Wisa</persName></persName> shouted, saying :—

<p><lb/>They urged
<lb/>Their chargers on, the clarions blared, dust rose
<lb/>To left and right and moon and sky waxed dim.
<lb/>Men grappled eagerly and showered blood.
<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Wisa</persName></persName> met once in the mellay,

<lb/>But <persName><persName>Wisa</persName></persName> turned away and fled the field

<p><lb/>The expedition from Irmdn went forth

<lb/>Toward <placeName><placeName>Sistan</placeName></placeName> in haste, while <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName>,
<lb/>With thirty thousand famous men—good swordsmen—
<lb/>Marched warily as far as the Hirmund
<lb/>With glaive and mace, and fortune at its height.
<lb/>Now <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> was at the burial-place erecting
<lb/>In pain and grief a charnel for his father,
<lb/>While brave <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>, whose mind was on the alert,
<lb/>Was in the city, and despatched an envoy
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Shamasas</persName></persName>. When this man reached the camp
<lb/>He gave his master's greetings, saying thus :—
<lb/><q>For ever may the monarch of <placeName><placeName>Turan</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Continue bright of heart and wear the crown.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zahhak</persName></persName> the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> was mine ancestor,
<lb/>And little do I love mine overlord,
<lb/>But by alliance have I purchased life
<lb/>Because I saw no other course. At present
<lb/>I dwell within the palace, ruling all
<lb/><placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>. When <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> went whelmed with grief
<lb/>To bury <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> my heart rejoiced, and I
<lb/>Will never see his face again. I ask
<lb/>The famous paladin for time to send
<lb/><persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName> a prudent cameleer ;
<lb/>'Twill shorten matters if he know my mind.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="268"/>
<lb/>I will despatch him fitting gifts besides

<lb/>Before his throne, resign to him my realm,
<lb/>And joy in him. I will not vex the paladin,
<lb/>But send him every kind of hoarded wealth.</q>
<pb n="359"/>
<lb/>Thus one hand held back <persName><persName>Shamasas</persName></persName> and one
<lb/>Was stretched for help. He sent a messenger
<lb/>And said: <q>Fly! Ply thy feathers and thy pinions,
<lb/>Announce to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> what thou hast seen, and say :—
<lb/><q>Pause not to rub thy head but come at once,
<lb/>For of the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> host two paladins,
<lb/>Like leopard's claws, advanced to fight with me;
<lb/>But when they were approaching the Hirmund
<lb/>I put their feet in fetters of dinars.
<lb/>Now if thou waitest to draw breath but once
<lb/>Our foes will have their will.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The envoy came

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> hearing this had the gold trappings placed
<lb/>Upon his steed, and faring night and day
<lb/>Rejoined his troops. Whenas he saw <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>
<lb/>Unmoved and full of knowledge and good counsel,
<lb/>He thought: <q>What cause have we to fear this host,
<lb/>For <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName> is but a pinch of dust
<lb/>To me?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then to <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>: <q>O man of prudence,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="269"/>
<lb/>Approved in all! now will I go by night
<lb/>And lay a hand upon the foe for blood.
<lb/>They shall be ware that I am back again,
<lb/>Back with full heart and ready to avenge.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He marked the stations of the hostile chiefs,
<lb/>Then drew his bow amain and shot three arrows
<lb/>Of poplar, bough-like, arching through the sky
<lb/>In three directions, and a clamour followed.
<pb n="360"/>
<lb/>When it was day the soldiers gathered round
<lb/>And marked the arrows, saying: <q>They are <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s!
<lb/>None other shooteth with such shafts as these.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Cried <persName><persName>Shamasas</persName></persName>: <q>O <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName>, thou Lion!
<lb/>Hadst thou not been remiss in fight, not dallied

<lb/>Then <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>He is but one, not <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs> or iron.
<lb/>Fear not, for I will grapple him anon.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Whenas the bright sun crossed the vault were heard
<lb/>Drums on the plain, and in the city sounds
<lb/>Of tymbals, clarions, gongs, and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs></rs> bells.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> donned his mail apace, bestrode his charger
<lb/>As swift as dust, while all his warriors mounted
<lb/>With vengeful thoughts and frowns upon their brows.
<lb/>He led the army forth upon the plain,
<lb/>Equipped with elephants and camp-enclosures,
<lb/>Where host encountered host and made the waste
<lb/>As 'twere a darksome mountain with the dust.
<lb/>Then <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName> with mace and buckler rushed
<milestone unit="vullers" n="270"/>
<lb/>To counter <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, and smote his glittering breast
<lb/>A blow that brake his famed cuirass. When <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>Withdrew the warriors of <placeName><placeName>Kabulistan</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Retreated, but brave <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> armed him afresh.
<lb/>His head was wroth, his blood was up, he brandished
<lb/>His father's mace, while <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName> advanced
<lb/>To challenge fight, a roaring Lion he,
<lb/>Before the host. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> had no sooner raised
<lb/>The reek of fight than <persName><persName>Khazarwan</persName></persName> was on him
<lb/>As quick as dust, while <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> in fury charged
<lb/>His foe, and brandishing the ox-like mace
<lb/>Smote Khazarwin upon the head and made
<lb/>The ground as 'twere a leopard's back with blood ;
<pb n="361"/>
<lb/>Then flung him down, trod on him, passed along
<lb/>And led the army forward to the plain,
<lb/>Inviting Shamasés to come and fight,
<lb/>But Shamdsas came not; his blood was chilled.
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> next descried <persName><persName>Kulbad</persName></persName> amid the dust
<lb/>And shouldered his steel mace. Thereon <persName><persName>Kulbad</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Observing <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> with mace and scimitar,
<lb/>Endeavoured to escape his foeman's sight,
<lb/>But <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> the cavalier strung up his bow
<lb/>And lightly aimed at him a poplar arrow,
<lb/>Struck full upon the girdle of <persName><persName>Kulbad</persName></persName>—
<lb/>A girdle that was wrought of links of steel—
<lb/>And pinned him to the pummel through the loins.
<lb/>His troops' hearts burned for him while <persName><persName>Shamasas</persName></persName>
<lb/>Despaired, his face paled when those chiefs were slain,
<lb/>And he and all his army in full flight
<lb/>Dispersed like sheep upon a stormy day,
<lb/>Pressed by the soldiers of <placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>And by <persName><persName>Mihrab</persName></persName>. The field was such with corpses
<lb/>That thou hadst said: <q>The troops are cramped for room.</q>
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs></rs> fled toward <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Their mail unfastened and their girdles snapped.</p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="271"/>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Shamasas</persName></persName> had reached the open plain
<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, the son of <persName><persName>Kawa</persName></persName>, came in sight
<lb/>Returning from pursuing <persName><persName>Wisa</persName></persName>'s host,
<lb/>Whose noblest he had slain so easily.
<lb/>The armies met together, <persName><persName>Shamasas</persName></persName>
<lb/>Met with <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName>, the lover of the fray,
<lb/>Who knowing his antagonists, and why
<lb/>They were retreating from Zdbulistan,
<lb/>Bade trumpets sound and occupied the road.
<lb/>Thus host encountered host. The paladin
<lb/>Said to his troops: <q>Ye men of noble name
<lb/>And ardent soul! go battle with your spears,
<pb n="362"/>
<lb/>And may ye rob the foe of life.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With cries
<lb/>Of maddened elephants they seized their spears,
<lb/>Which made a reed-bed of the battlefield
<lb/>And veiled the sun and moon. He lightly slew
<lb/>Those <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> troops and flung them on the track,

<lb/>In shameful plight before the Crocodile.
<lb/>Full of impatience great <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>
<lb/>Looked out for him, and seeing him approach
<lb/>Reminded him of their ancestral feud,
<lb/>Began with <persName><persName>Salm</persName></persName> and <persName><persName>Tur</persName></persName>, and washed away
<lb/>From heart and eyes the reverence due to kings.

<lb/>Smote <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName> upon the neck and flung

<lb/>And left <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> bereft of throne and crown.

<lb/>If thou hast gained the object of thy lust
<lb/>And appetite hath ceased, so strong betore,
<lb/>Why shouldst thou ask this gloomy mournful dust
<lb/>To make thee miserable any more ?
<lb/>They haled the other captives forth in shame,
<lb/>And asking quarter. Virtuous <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName>
<lb/>Saw this and anxiously besought the king :—
<lb/><q>To slay so many noble warriors

<lb/>This done he marched from <placeName><placeName>Dahistan</placeName></placeName> to <placeName><placeName>Rai</placeName></placeName>,

<lb/><q>The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></rs> are upon the march for vengeance,
<lb/>They send out cameleers on every side,
<lb/>Have gathered countless troops and have renounced
<lb/>Home and delights,</q> they neither ate nor slept,
<lb/>Such was their terror of <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>.
<lb/>A message from them came to <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName> :—
<lb/><q>O man of mighty purpose, famous chief!
<lb/>We are thy slaves in all, and by thy word
<lb/>We live. <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, as thou knowest, is at home
<lb/>And acting with the monarch of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>Men like <persName><persName>Barzin</persName></persName>, <persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> the warrior,
<lb/><persName><persName>Kharrad</persName></persName>, and that host-shatterer <persName><persName>Kishwad</persName></persName>,
<lb/>Are men of might with hands that reach afar
<lb/>And will not keep their clutches off <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>,
<pb n="366"/>
<lb/>Now when these warriors wheel about us here
<lb/>And brandish their sharp lances in his sight
<lb/>The great <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName> will be enraged,
<lb/>His heart will be inflamed against his captives,
<lb/>And for his crown's sake he will bring to dust
<lb/>The heads of all our blameless company.
<lb/>If prudent Ighrfras see fit to free us
<lb/>We will disperse, praise him before the great
<lb/>And make thanksgiving unto God for him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Wise <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName> replied: <q>Such skilleth not;
'twere a foe's act; this human <rs type="divinity"><rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs></rs>
<lb/>Would be incensed. I will not take other order
<lb/>So that my brother may not turn upon me

<milestone unit="vullers" n="276"/>
<lb/>And will advance to fight us at <placeName><placeName>Sari</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>I will deliver you to him, myself
<lb/>Evacuate <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName>, forbear to fight
<lb/>And bring to infamy my honoured head.</q></p>
<p><lb/>At this reply the nobles of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Bent to the ground, and full of praise for him
<lb/>Despatched a courier from <placeName><placeName>Sari</placeName></placeName> with speed
<lb/>To <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, the son of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>. The message ran :—
<lb/><q>Our God hath pitied us; wise <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName>
<lb/>Is now our friend. This is the pact between us:
<lb/>If only two frénian warriors
<lb/>Shall come and offer fight that noble man,
<lb/>Who walketh fortune's path, will quit <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>For <placeName><placeName>Rai</placeName></placeName>, and so some one of us may scape
<lb/>The <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s clutch.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The courier reached <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>And made the glad news known to <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, who called
<lb/>The nobles, told them all, then said: <q>My friends,
<lb/>Pards of the fray and winners of renown!
<lb/>Who is the warrior of princely heart,
<lb/>All black with courage, who will raise his neck
<pb n="367"/>

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Kishwad</persName></persName> accepting struck his breast and said :—
<lb/><q>My hand is ready for an act so just.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The glorious <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> approved him, saying thus :—
<lb/><q>Live happily while months and years endure.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So from <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName> a troop of warriors
<lb/>Intent on war set face toward <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>When they had journeyed for a stage or two
<lb/>The tidings came to <persName><persName>Ighriras</persName></persName> their friend,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="277"/>
<lb/>Who blew the brazen trumpets, marched away
<lb/>His troops and left the captives at <placeName><placeName>Sari</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>When fortunate <persName><persName>Kishwad</persName></persName> arrived he found
<lb/>The key to loose their bonds, provided steeds,
<lb/>And from <placeName><placeName>Amul</placeName></placeName> sped toward Zébul. When <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>Was told: <q><persName><persName>Kishwad</persName></persName> is coming back in triumph,</q>
<lb/>He gave a largess to the mendicants,

<lb/>In state, while weeping tears of joy for those
<lb/>That had been captive in the Lion's clutch,
<lb/>And then with dust upon his head wept tears
<lb/>Of grief o'er famed <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName>. He took the loved ones

<lb/>And they became as when <persName><persName>Naudar</persName></persName> was king,

<p><lb/>He blew

a brave but unsuccessful general. <persName><persName>Gustaham</persName></persName> almost drops out of

<p><lb/>One night as <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> sat speaking to his chiefs
<lb/>And retinue about <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>,
<lb/>He said: <q>Although our paladins possess
<lb/>Unsleeping fortune and enlightened minds
<lb/>We need a <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, one of the royal race,
<lb/>Skilled in the lore of eld. The host resembleth

<lb/>A man of <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> through whose words wisdom shineth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They found none of the seed of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>
<lb/>But <persName><persName>Zav</persName></persName>, son of <persName><persName>Tahmasp</persName></persName>, with monarch's might
<lb/>And hero's worth to grace the lofty throne.
<lb/><persName><persName>Karan</persName></persName> took with a gallant company
<lb/>The joyful news to <persName><persName>Zav</persName></persName>: <q>In thee reviveth

<p><lb/>On an auspicious day fair-fortuned <persName><persName>Zav</persName></persName>
<lb/>Came and acceded to the lofty throne.
<lb/>The mighty praised him, showering offerings ;
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> too did homage. Five years passed away
<note n="1">See Introd. p. 71.</note>
<pb n="371"/>
<lb/>While <persName><persName>Zav</persName></persName>, a wise old man, sat on the throne
<lb/>And judged and lavished till the world grew young.
<lb/>He kept his soldiers back from evil ways,
<lb/>Wrapped up himself in communings with God.
<lb/>None dared to rob or slay, but after him
<lb/>Men saw no lack of slaughter. There was a famine,
<lb/>There was not dew or rain, the ground and herbs
<lb/>Were parched, and bread was worth its weight in drachms.
<lb/>The hosts had faced each other for five months,
<lb/>Engaged in fierce encounters day by day
<lb/>As fitteth chiefs and heroes, but that famine
<lb/>Left them resourceless, wasted woof and warp,
<lb/>And all confessed : <q>We are ourselves to blame,</q>
<lb/>While wails and cries for help rose from both hosts.
<lb/>At length an envoy came to <persName><persName>Zav</persName></persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>Tt is our own fault that this Wayside Inn
<lb/>Affordeth naught but travail, care, and anguish.
<lb/>Come let us share the earth and bless each other.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They gave up thoughts of war for famine pressed,
<lb/>Agreed to drop the ancient feud, to share
<milestone unit="vullers" n="281"/>
<lb/>The world according to just precedent<ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>And put all bygones out of memory.
<lb/>The portion of <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> both near and far
*Twixt the Jihin and marches of <placeName><placeName>Turan</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And so along toward <placeName><placeName>Khutan</placeName></placeName> and <placeName><placeName>Chin</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Was given to the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs></rs> as their kingdom,
<lb/>While <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> abandoned all the nomad tribes.
<lb/>Such was the sharing, such the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs></rs>' bounds.
<lb/>Then <persName><persName>Zav</persName></persName> led forth his host to go to <placeName><placeName>Pars</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Old as he was he made earth young again;
<lb/>While <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> departed for <placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>And men received them both with open arms.
<lb/>The roar of thunder filled the mountain-tops

<lb/>And earth recovered colour, scent, and beauty ;

<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> called the chiefs and offered thanks to God,
<lb/>Who had converted scarcity to plenty,
<lb/>Men set up feasting-places everywhere
<lb/>And banished feud and cursing from their hearts.

<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> answered: <q>Since I girt the belt of manhood
<milestone unit="vullers" n="284"/>
<lb/>No rider like me hath bestridden steed,
<lb/>None hath essayed to wield my sword and mace,
<pb n="376"/>
<lb/>And horsemen showed their cruppers, not their reins,
<lb/>When I appeared. I have fought night and day
<lb/>And all my life have dreaded growing old.
<lb/>At length my back is bent, I wield no more
<lb/>A falchion of <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>; yet God be praised
<lb/>That from my root a glorious shoot hath sprung,
<lb/>Whose head will reach the sky, and thou shalt see
<lb/>It grow in valour, <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> being now.
<lb/>A straight-stemmed Cypress' whom the crown of greatness ,
<lb/>Becometh well; but he must have a charger ;
<lb/>These <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs></rs> horses will not do for him.
<lb/>I will seek out some elephantine steed,
<lb/>Wherever there are herds, and say to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> :-—
<lb/><q>Wilt thou consent, consent with all thy heart
<lb/>To gird thy loins to execute revenge
<lb/>Upon the offspring of <persName><persName>Zadsham</persName></persName> ?</q></q></p>
<p><lb/><placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>Was glad of heart and blithe of face as <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>
<lb/>Sent camel-posts to every quarter, armed
<lb/>His cavaliers, and said to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> thus :—
<lb/><q>Mine elephantine son, a whole head taller
<lb/>Than other men! a work of toil is toward
<lb/>To break thy slumbers, quiet, and delights.
<lb/>Thou art not yet of age to fight, my son!
<lb/>But what of that? This is no time for feasting.
<lb/>Yet with the scent of milk upon thy lips,
<lb/>And with thy heart all set on sports and pleasures,
<lb/>How shall I send thee to the battlefield
<lb/>Against the Lions and the mighty men?
<lb/>Now for thine answer, and may majesty
<lb/>And goodness be thy mates.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> thus :—
<lb/><q>O noble prince, ambitious of renown!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="285"/>
<lb/>Good sooth thou hast forgotten how I showed
<pb n="377"/>
<lb/>My courage publicly. The paladin
<lb/>Hath surely heard of the fierce elephant,
<lb/>And <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName>, and I shall lose my fame
<lb/>If now I tremble at <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>.
<lb/>This is the time for fight and not for flight.
<lb/>The overthrow of Lions, the pursuit
<lb/>Of war, renown, and battle, fashion heroes ;
<lb/>But 'tis not so with women; their concern
<lb/>Is food and sleep.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> said: <q>O gallant youth,
<lb/>The chief of princes and the warriors' stay !
<lb/>My heart rejoiceth when I hear thee speak
<lb/>Of that white elephant and <placeName><placeName>Mount Sipand</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>For truly since that fight was won with ease
<lb/>Why fear I for thee now? <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>
<lb/>And his designs deprive me of my sleep,
<lb/>Yet can I send thee to contend with one
<lb/>Who is a gallant king and loveth battle ?
<lb/>Now is thy time for feasts and twanging harps,
<lb/>For quaffing wine, and tales of warlike deeds;
<lb/>'tis not thy time for warfare, fame, and strife,
<lb/>Or sending up the earth's dust to the moon.</q></p>
<p><lb/>
<lb/>He said: <q>I am not one for ease and revel.
<lb/>'Twere base to pamper in luxuriousness
<lb/>Such arms as these, and these long hands of mine.
<lb/>What though the battlefield and fight be hard
<lb/>God and victorious fortune are mine aids.
<lb/>In battle thou shalt mark me how I go
<lb/>Upon my ruddy charger through the blood,
<lb/>And I will carry in my hand a cloud<ref target="n.1"/>
<lb/>That is of watered hue but raineth gore,
<lb/>While from the substance of it flasheth fire :
<lb/>Its head shall bruise the brains of elephants,
<lb/>My quiver when I clothe myself in mail
<note n="1">I.e., a mace of steel.</note>
<pb n="378"/>
<lb/>Shall shock the world, and all the fortresses
<milestone unit="vullers" n="286"/>
<lb/>That shall withstand mine iron mace's blows,
<lb/>My breast and arms and neck, need never fear
<lb/>An arbalist or catapult,.or want
<lb/>A bishop for their castellan. The rocks
<lb/>Shall redden to their cores when I advance
<lb/>My lance in fight. I need a steed hill-high
<lb/>Caught by my lasso, up to weight like mine
<lb/>In war, and not impatient of restraint.
<lb/>I need a mace too like a mountain-crag,
<lb/>For hosts will come against me from <placeName><placeName>Turan</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>And when they come, though I should fight unaided,
<lb/>Their blood shall rain upon the battlefield.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The paladin was moved, and thou hadst said,
<lb/><q>He will pour out his soul.</q> He thus replied :—
<lb/><q>O tired of ease and revel! I will bring thee
<lb/>The mace of <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName> the cavalier, preserved
<lb/>In memory of him, wherewith thou slewest
<lb/>The elephant. Live ever, paladin!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> ordered: <q>Bring the mace employed by <persName><persName>Sam</persName></persName>
<lb/>In his campaign against <placeName><placeName>Mazandaran</placeName></placeName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="287"/>
<lb/>To this famed paladin that he may take
<lb/>Our foemen's breath away.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> saw it
<lb/>He smiled with joy, called blessings down on <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,
<lb/>And said: <q>Thou art the chief of paladins ;
<lb/>But now, to bear my person, mace, and <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs>,
<lb/>I need a steed.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> mused at what he said
<lb/>And oft invoked God's blessing on his head.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> caught <rs type="horse"><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs></rs></head>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> had gathered all his herds of horses,
<lb/>And many from <placeName><placeName>Kabul</placeName></placeName>, the herdsmen drove them
<pb n="379"/>
<lb/>Past <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, calling out the royal brands.
<lb/>Whenever <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> caught a steed he pressed
<lb/>Its back until its belly reached the ground.
<lb/>At length a herd of piebald steeds sped by,
<lb/>Among them a grey mare short-legged and fleet,
<lb/>With lion's chest and ears like two steel daggers,
<lb/>Her breast and shoulder full and barrel fine.
<lb/>Behind her came a colt as tall as she,
<lb/>His buttocks and his breast as broad as hers,
<lb/>Dark-eyed and tapering—a piebald bay
<lb/>With belly hard and jet-black, hoofs of steel,
<lb/>His whole form beautiful, and spotted roan
<lb/>Like roses spread upon a ground of saffron.
<lb/>He could discern the tiny emmet's foot
<lb/>Upon black cloth at night two leagues away,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="288"/>
<lb/>Had elephantine strength with camel's stature,
<lb/>And pluck of lions bred on <placeName><placeName>Mount Bistun</placeName></placeName>.
<lb/>Now <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> gazing on the mare observed
<lb/>That elephantine colt, and coiled his lasso
<lb/>To catch it, but an ancient herdsman cried :—
<lb/><q>O chief! forbear to take another's charger.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Whose?</q> <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> asked. <q>The thighs have not been branded.</q>
<lb/>The herdsman answered: <q>Never mind his brand ;
<lb/>There are all kinds of rumours as to him.
<lb/>We call him <rs type="horse"><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs></rs>. He is a piebald bay,
<lb/>As good as water and as bright as fire.
<lb/>We call him <q> <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s <rs type="horse"><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs></rs>,</q> but know of none
<lb/>To master him. He hath been fit to saddle
<lb/>These three years. All the nobles have observed him,
<lb/>But at the sight of noose and cavalier
<lb/>The dam is like a lion. We cannot tell,
<lb/>O chief of paladins! the reason why,
<lb/>But as a prudent man forbear to fight
<lb/>A <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs> such as this, for when the mare
<pb n="380"/>
<lb/>Is in the fighting humour she will rend
<lb/>The hearts of lions and the hides of pards.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The old man's sayings opened <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s eyes,
<lb/>He cast his royal lasso and entangled
<lb/>The piebald's head. Then like a furious elephant
<lb/>The dam advanced as she would tear off <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s,
<lb/>Who roared as savage lions roar and scared her,
<lb/>Then with one buffet on the withers sent her
<lb/>All trembling to the ground. She rose, sprang back,
<lb/>Then turned and joined the herd, while mighty <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Stood firm and drew the lasso tighter still,
<lb/>And laid his hand upon the bay colt's back
<milestone unit="vullers" n="289"/>
<lb/>Which gave not; thou hadst said: <q>It is not felt.</q>
<lb/>The hero thought: <q>This is the mount for me;
<lb/>Now I can act.</q> 
<lb/>He mounted swift as wind,
<lb/>The ruddy steed sped with him. He inquired :—
<lb/><q>What is this <rs type="mythologicalcreature"><rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs></rs>'s price or who can tell it?</q>
<lb/><q>If thou art <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>,</q> said the herd, <q>redress
<lb/><placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> upon his back. Its broad champaign
<lb/>Shall be his price; then thou wilt right the world.</q>
<lb/>The hero's lips grew coral-like with smiles ;
<lb/>He said: <q>All good is God's.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Bent on revenge
<lb/>He saddled ruddy <rs type="horse"><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs></rs>, and giving him
<lb/>The rein observed his courage, strength, and blood,
<lb/>And that he could bear rider, arms, and mail.
<lb/>The piebald grew so precious that at night
<lb/>They burned wild rue to right and left of him
<lb/>For fear of harm. <q>They practise sorcery,</q>
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said. In fight no deer was swifter.
<lb/>He was soft-mouthed, foam-scattering, light in hand,
<lb/>With rounded buttocks, clever, and well paced.</p>
<p><lb/>The gallant rider and his new-found steed
<lb/>Made <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>'s heart joyful as the jocund spring.
<pb n="381"/>
<lb/>He oped his treasury-door, gave out dinars,
<lb/>Nor recked of day or morrow. When he mounted
<lb/>His elephant and dropped a ball the sound
<lb/>Made by the cup was heard for miles around.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> led the Host against Afrdstyab</head>

<lb/>'Twas Resurrection in <placeName><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName></placeName>
<lb/>And earth called loudly to the dead: <q>Arise!</q>
<lb/>A host departed from <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName> like lions;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="290"/>
<lb/>All hands were bathed in blood. In front came <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> v
<lb/>As paladin, then veteran warriors.
<lb/>The troops so spread o'er passes, plains, and dales
<lb/>That ravens had not room to fly, while tymbals
<lb/>Beat everywhere and tumult filled the world
<lb/>As at that time of roses <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> led forth
<lb/>The army from <placeName><placeName>Zabul</placeName></placeName>. <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>
<lb/>Thereat arose from banquet, rest, and slumber,

<lb/>Fared o'er the desert to the scene of war,
<lb/>And when the armies were two leagues apart
<lb/><persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> called the veterans, and thus harangued them :—
<lb/><q>Ye men of wisdom, well approven warriors!
<lb/>We have arrayed us here an ample host
<lb/>And with advantages; yet with no <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>
<lb/>Upon the throne our plants want rede, our toils

<lb/>Was on the throne new glory ever came,
<lb/>And now we need a <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> of royal seed
<pb n="382"/>
<lb/>To gird him there. An archimage hath told me

<lb/>A future <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>'s own line

<lb/>But late and early hurry on and tell him :—
<lb/><q>The soldiers long, and deck the throne, for thee.
<lb/>We see none fitted for the royal crown,
<lb/>O monarch, our defender! but thyself.</q> </q>
<lb/>When <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName> had spoken matchless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> swept
<lb/>The ground with his eyelashes, joyfully
<lb/>Got on the back of <rs type="horse"><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs></rs>, and proudly rode
<lb/>In quest of <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName>. A <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> outpost
<lb/>Held the road strongly, but he charged the foe
<lb/>As champion of the host with his brave troops,
<lb/>Armed with the ox-head mace. He brandished it
<lb/>And towering in his wrath struck out and raised
<lb/>His battle-cry. The <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs></rs>' hearts all failed,
<lb/>His arm laid many low. They strove with him,
<lb/>But had to flee the battle in the end.
<lb/>With broken hearts and tearful eyes they turned
<lb/>Back to <persName><persName>Afrasiyab</persName></persName>, and told him all.
<lb/>He sorrowed at their case, called one Kulun,
<lb/>A gallant <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> warrior full of craft,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Choose horsemen from the host,
<pb n="383"/>
<lb/>Go thou too to the palace of the king,

<p><lb/>Kulun

<p><lb/>Now <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> the elect and brave marched on

<lb/>Of mount <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName> perceived a splendid seat
<lb/>With running water and abundant trees—
<lb/>The home for youth. Upon a river's bank
<lb/>Was set a throne besprinkled with rose-water
<lb/>And purest musk. A young man like the moon
<lb/>Was seated on the throne beneath the shade,
<lb/>While many paladins with girded loins
<lb/>Stood ranked as is the custom of the great,
<lb/>And formed a court well fitted for a <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>,
<lb/>Like Paradise in form and hue. On seeing
<lb/>The paladin approach they went to greet him
<lb/>And said: <q>Pass not, O famous paladin !
<lb/>We are the hosts and thou shalt be our guest.
<lb/>Dismount that we may join in jollity,
<lb/>And pledge thee, famous warrior! In wine.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But he replied: <q>Exalted, noble chiefs!
<lb/>I must to mount <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName> upon affairs
<lb/>Of moment, and not loiter in my task.
<lb/>I have much work to do, the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs></rs> marches
<lb/>Are full of foes, all households weep and mourn,
<lb/>I must not revel while the throne is void.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They said: <q>If thou art hasting to <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="293"/>
<lb/>Be pleased to say of whom thou art in quest,
<lb/>For we who revel here are cavaliers
<pb n="384"/>
<lb/>From that blest land, and we will be thy guides
<lb/>And make friends on the way.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He thus replied :—
<lb/><q>The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> is there, a holy man and noble.
<lb/>His name is <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName>, sprung from the seed
<lb/>Of <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName> the just and prosperous.
<lb/>Direct me to him if ye wot of him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The leader said: <q>I wot of <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName>.
<lb/>If thou wilt enter and delight our hearts
<lb/>I will direct thee and describe the man.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The peerless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> hearing this dismounted
<lb/>Like wind, and hurried to the water's edge,
<lb/>To where the folk were seated in the shade.
<lb/>The youth sat down upon the throne of gold
<lb/>And taking <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s hand within his own
<lb/>Filled up and drained a goblet <q>To the Free!</q>
<lb/>Then handed it to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>, saying thus :—
<lb/><q>Thou askest me, O famous warrior !
<lb/>About <persName><persName>Kubad</persName></persName>, whence knowest thou his name?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Said <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>: <q>From the paladin I come
<lb/>With joyful news, The chiefs have decked the throne
<lb/>And called on <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName> to be the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>.
<lb/>My sire, the chief whom men call <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>, said thus :—
<lb/><q>Go with an escort unto mount <placeName><placeName>Alburz</placeName></placeName>,
<lb/>Find valiant <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName> and homage him,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="294"/>
<lb/>Yet tarry not, but say: <q>The warriors call thee
<lb/>And have prepared the throne.</q></q> If thou hast tidings
<lb/>Give them and speed him to the sovereign power.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The gallant stripling, smiling, answered: <q>I
<lb/>Am <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName> and sprung from <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName>,
<lb/>I know my lineage from sire to sire.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> heard he bowed, rose from his seat
<lb/>Of gold to do obeisance, and thus spake :—
<lb/><q>O ruler of the rulers of the world,
<lb/>The shelter of the brave and stay of chiefs!
<pb n="385"/>
<lb/>Now let <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>'s throne wait upon thy will,

<lb/>Thy right seat is the throne of king of kings;
<lb/>May <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs></rs> and glory be thine own! I bring
<lb/>A greeting for the king of earth from <persName><persName>Zal</persName></persName>,
<lb/>The chieftain and the valiant paladin.
<lb/>If now the <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> shall bid his slave to speak
<lb/>I will acquit me of the chieftain's message.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Brave <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName> rose from his seat, intent
<lb/>Upon the speaker's words, while peerless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>
<lb/>Discharged his embassage. With throbbing heart
<lb/>The young prince said: <q>Bring me a cup of wine,</q>
<lb/>And drank to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>'s health, who likewise drained
<lb/>A goblet to the monarch's life, and said :—
<lb/><q>Thou mindest me of glorious <persName><persName>Faridun</persName></persName></q>
<lb/>(For <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> was rejoiced at seeing him),
<lb/><q>Not for an instant may the world lack thee,
<lb/>The throne of kingship, or the royal crown.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The instruments struck up, great was the joy,
<lb/>The grief was small, the ruddy wine went round
<milestone unit="vullers" n="295"/>
<lb/>And flushed the youthful <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>, who said to <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> :— 
<lb/><q>Mine ardent soul in sleep saw. two white hawks
<lb/>Approaching from <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName>, and bringing with them
<lb/>A crown bright as the sun. They came to me
<lb/>With dainty and caressing airs and set it
<lb/>Upon my head. I wakened full of hope
<lb/>Because of that bright crown and those white hawks,
<lb/>And made a court here such as kings would hold,
<lb/>As thou perceivest, by the river-side.
<lb/>Like those white hawks hath matchless <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> come
<lb/>With news that I shall wear the warriors' crown.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> heard thereof he said: <q>Thy dream
<lb/>Had a prophetic source. Now let us rise
<lb/>And journey to <placeName><placeName>Iran</placeName></placeName> and to the chiefs.</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="296"/>
<p><lb/>Then <persName><persName>Kai Kubad</persName></persName> rose swift as fire and mounted
<pb n="386"/>
<lb/>His steed, while <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> girt his loins like wind
<lb/>And journeyed proudly with him. Night and day
<lb/>He travelled till he reached the <rs type="ethnic"><rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs></rs> outposts,
<lb/>When bold Kulin, ware of his coming, marched
<lb/>To meet and fight with him, The <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs> thereat

<lb/>But mighty <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName> said to him: <q>O <rs type="role"><rs type="role">Shah</rs></rs>!
<lb/>'tis not a fight for thee, they will not stand

<lb/>Who will confront my mace and scimitar ?</q>
<lb/>He spake, spurred on and with a single blow
<lb/>Threw one and hurled another at a third
<lb/>Whose brains ran down his nostrils. Those strong hands 
<lb/>Unhorsed the foe and dashed them to the ground,
<lb/>And in their fall brake heads and necks and backs.
<lb/>Kulun beheld this div escaped from bonds
<lb/>With mace in hand and lasso at his saddle,
<lb/>Charged him like wind and thrusting with his spear
<lb/>Brake through some fastenings of his mail, but <persName><persName>Rustam</persName></persName>,
<lb/>What while his foe was lost in wonderment,
<lb/>Seized on the spear and wrenched it from Kulun,
<lb/>Then roared like thunder from the mountain-tops,
