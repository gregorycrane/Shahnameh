52. You must heed one piece of advice from me.

82. His worshiper would not bring a lamp with him.
83. Following the wretched devil's upside-down scheme,
84. He dug a deep pit in the garden.
85. Then Iblis covered that deep pit
86. With brush, and awaited the path.
87. At night he went to the garden,
88. You seeker of the name of the chief of the noble Arabians!
89. When he came near that deep pit,
90. The king's fortune turned upside down all at once.
91. He fell into the pit and was shattered,

Here is my translation for the next set of verses:

102. He would not be brave in shedding his father's blood.

104. Seized his father's place through this scheme.

115. When he said this, he made another preparation,
116. Devised another wondrous scheme.
117. He adorned a youth from among his own,
118. Eloquent, wise, pure of heart and body.
119. He sent him directly to Zahak,
120. Whose only talk was of praise for him.
121. He said to him, "If I provide the king
122. With a noble, pure cook,
123. When Zahak heard this, he favored him,
124. And appointed him a place in the kitchen.
125. The key to the king's kitchen
126. Was given to him by the commanding ruler.
127. In those times, food was not abundant,
128. And few dishes were made from slaughtered animals.
129. They ate nothing but plants,
130. As nothing but plants had yet sprouted from the earth.
131. Then Ahriman, the evil-schemer, devised a plan,
132. And placed the killing of animals in his heart.
133. From every kind of bird and quadruped,
134. He made dishes and brought them one by one.
135. He nourished him on their blood like a lion,
136. So that he might make the king brave.  
137. Whatever he said, he obeyed his commands,
138. And pledged his heart as hostage to his orders.
139. First, he gave him a dish of testicles,
140. And kept him healthy on it for some time.
141. He ate it and praised it greatly,
142. The ill-fated one found its taste pleasing.
143. Thus spoke Iblis, the trickster,
144. "May you live forever, O exalted king!"  
145. "Tomorrow I will prepare a dish for you
146. That will nourish you thoroughly."
147. He left and spent the entire night awake,
148. Wondering what wondrous food to prepare the next day.
149. The next day, when the azure dome arose  
150. And displayed the yellow ruby,
The verses appear to be narrating a story in which a character named Zahak (also called Bivaraasp), the son of a noble and generous man named Mardas, is being deceived by Iblis (the Devil in Islamic mythology) who comes in disguise as a well-wisher and leads the young man astray by making him pledge to keep a secret before revealing his words of seduction.
Here is my translation for the next set of verses:

151. Dishes of partridge and white francolin
152. Were prepared, and he came with a hopeful heart. 
153. When the Arab king reached for the plate,
154. His foolish mind surrendered to its delights.
155. On the third day, the table was adorned  
156. With dishes of bird and lamb of all kinds.
157. On the fourth day when he laid the table,
158. He made a dish from a young ox's back.
159. In it were saffron and rose water,
160. That year's aged wine and pure musk. 
161. When Zahak took it and ate,
162. He was amazed by that exceptional man.
163. He said to him, "Look, whatever you desire,
164. Ask of me, O noble one."
165. The cook said to him, "O king,
166. May you ever live joyfully and as a ruler."
167. "My heart is full of love for you, 
168. My entire life's provision comes from your countenance."
169. "I have one wish from the king,
170. Though I do not have that rank,"
171. "That the king would command me to kiss his shoulder,
172. To kiss and rub my eyes and face on it."
173. When Zahak heard his words,
174. He did not conceal his real intent. 
175. He said to him, "I grant you this wish,
176. May your name become exalted!"
177. He commanded the devil, who was like his partner,  
178. To let him kiss his shoulder.
179. When he kissed it, he disappeared into the ground,
180. No one in the world had seen such a wonder!
181. Two black snakes emerged from his shoulders,
182. He became distressed and sought a cure from all sides.
183. At last he cut both of them from his shoulders,
184. It is fitting if you remain amazed at this.
185. Like branches of a tree, those two black snakes
186. Again emerged from the king's shoulders.
187. Wise physicians gathered around,
188. Each relating a tale.
189. They tried all kinds of tricks,
190. But could not find a cure for that affliction.
191. Then like a skilled physician, Iblis came swiftly
192. And went to Zahak with his cunning.
193. He said to him, "This was destined to happen,
194. Wait and see what becomes of it, do not grieve."
195. "Prepare dishes and let them eat peacefully, 
196. There is no other cure but this."
197. "Give them nothing but human brains to eat,
198. Else they may die from this nourishment."  
199. See how the manly devil persisted in this quest,
200. What he sought and saw in this discourse!
Here is my translation for the next two verses:

201. Perhaps he will devise a secret solution,
202. So that the world remains populated with people.

These verses continue the narrative of the evil devil/Iblis advising the tyrannical king Zahak, who has been afflicted with snakes growing out of his shoulders. Iblis suggests feeding the snakes human brains as a cure, while hinting that he may have a hidden solution in mind to prevent too many people from being killed for this purpose, so that the world remains populated.

The story portrays Iblis/the devil manipulating Zahak into committing evil acts like killing innocent people, exploiting his greed and ambition. It serves as a cautionary tale about being misled by evil counselors and one's own desires toward cruelty and injustice.
