<pb n="3"/>




<div><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Bahram’s accession and inaugural measures. His adventures, amorous and otherwise, among his subjects. His relations with foreign potentates. His instructions to his officials, and remission of taxation. His introduction of the Gypsies into Iran, and his death.</p>
</div>
<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>Bahram Gur (Varahran V., A.D. 420-438) is said by Tabari and Mas'udi to have been twenty years old at the time of his accession.<note place="foot">NT, p. 98; MM, ii. 190.</note> 

According to Tabari he reigned either eighteen or twenty-three years.<note place="foot">NT, p. 112.</note> Mas'udi says the latter.<note place="foot">MM, id.</note> On the other hand, Mir Khand, who tells us that he followed the most generally received account, perhaps Firdausi’s own, states that Bahram reigned sixty-three years.<note>RM, Pt. I, Vol. ii. p. 362.</note> No doubt, popular tradition lovingly prolonged to the utmost the reign of this Shah who, like James V. of Scotland, was <quote>King of the Commons.</quote> The poet was at no loss for material in this part of his work, and the reign is the most diverting in the Shahnameh. Its interest with regard to the question of the provenance of the Arabian Nights has been noted already.<note place="foot">See Vol. vi. p. 250.</note> As is to be expected in the circumstances, the subject-matter is largely legendary, though some authentic features have been preserved, and there can be little doubt but that Bahram’s own character as depicted by Firdausi is in the main historically correct. He fulfilled the promises made by him when a candidate for the throne,


<pb n="4"/>

but gave himself up largely to pleasure, though this does not seem
to have impaired his activities at critical moments. He appears, too,
to have been fortunate in his administrators. His chief minister,
Mihr Narsi, who is not to be confounded with Narsi, the Shah’s
brother, and three of his sons were at the head of affairs. One
was the principal, or nearly so, of the official hierarchy, another
was chief superintendent of the taxes, and the third was commander-in-chief.<note n="1">NT, pp. 106, 108 seq.</note> Mihr Narsi and his father Burdza are stated to
have held office under Yazdagird, Bahram’s father, and the former
was reappointed chief minister when Yazdagird, Bahram’s son,
came to the throne.<note n="2">ZT, ii. pp. 122, 127; NT, pp. 113.</note> He was himself a prince and an Arsacid, so
it would seem that the supplanted family had regained a great
position for itself under the new dispensation, and that the state of
things fully justified the pronouncement put by later legend into
the mouth of Kaid.<note n="3">See Vol. vi. pp. 256, 267.</note> Bahram Gur began his reign with a persecution
of the Christians, which led to war with the Eastern Roman
Empire. There is a slight allusion to such a war in the poem,<note n="4">See p. 84.</note> but
the chief incident recorded to have taken place is a pacific one.<note n="5">See p. 100 seq.</note>
§§ 1 and 2. Bahram devotes the first days of his reign to
carrying out his promises of reform made before his accession,<note n="6">See Vol. vi. p. 406.</note>
and to the relief of taxation.
§§ 3-16. We have here a series of popular legends of Bahram’s
adventures when going about unrecognised among various classes
of his subjects. The story of the miser occurs twice.<note n="7">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note><note n="8">§§ 4 and 15 seg.</note>
§§ 19-22. We have here the story of Bahram’s most famous
exploit, which is historical, though as much cannot be said of the
various details with which popular appreciation has embellished it.
Historically, the foes over whom Bahram won his great triumph
were the Haitalians, or White Huns.<note n="9">See Vol. i. p. 19.</note> This is clear on Firdausi’s
own showing when he comes to the reign of Piruz.<note n="10">See p. 164 seq.</note> Later on
again, in the reign of Nushirwan, ample distinction is made
between the subjects of the Khan of Chin and the Haitalians,<note n="11">See p. 328 seg.</note>
In substituting the former for the latter on this occasion Firdausi
errs in good company, Tabari, Mas'udi, and Mir Khand all name
the Turks as the enemy,<note n="12">NT, p. 99; MM, ii. 190; RM, Pt. I., Vol. ii. p. 357.</note> and since they did not come upon the
scene for another century and more,<note n="13">See Vol. i. p. 20.</note> we learn approximately the


<pb n="5"/> 
earliest date at which the story of Bahram’s exploit could have been edited in its existing form. According to the Persian Tabari<note n="1">ZT, ii. 120.</note> —the version adapted from the original Arabic by Bal’ami, the minister of the Samanid prince Mansur, son of Nuh (A.D. 961-976), about A.D. 963—the Khan was put to flight, according to the Arabic<note n="2">NT, p. 101.</note> slain in the battle by Bahram’s own hand. Both agree that the Khatun, or wife of the Khan, was taken prisoner and sent to serve in the famous Fire-temple at Shiz, whither Bahram had gone to pray for success in his expedition.<note n="3">See p. 86; ZT, ii. 121; NT, 104.</note> According to the Arabic Tabari, Bahram, as an act of thanksgiving for his victory, relieved his subjects of taxation for three years.<note n="4">NT, 105.</note> This probably is the popular version of the fact that great reforms in that connexion were effected during his reign, but they could not have been justified, one would think, to the extent stated by the amount of plunder taken from the Haitalians, and still less to the extent described in the Shahnama, which affirms that he almost reformed taxation away altogether. It may be added that the various accounts of Bahram’s expedition against the Haitalians are in substantial accord though they differ in detail, e.g., as to how far the enemy had advanced at the time of the battle, the route that Bahram followed in his march, and the number of troops that he took with him.
</p>

<p> §24. Bahram’s war with the Eastern Roman Empire, in which he was not very successful, came to an end in A.D. 422, but Firdausi (§ 19) makes it synchronise with that against the Haitalians which, according to the Persian Tabari,<note n="5">ZT, ii. 119.</note> took place five years later. Next we hear of an envoy sent by Caesar (§§ 19, 23), and then of his belated audience with the Shah. The points discussed are not the terms of peace, but certain <quote>hard questions,</quote><note n="6">As to which see p. 102 seq.</note> and it is only incidentally that the envoy mentions that Rum is ready to pay tribute to Iran. We have a similar case in the reign of Nushirwan when the Raja of Hind sends the game of chess to that Shah, who returns the compliment with the game of nard,<note n="7">See p. 384 seq.</note> while in the next volume we shall find the disgraced counsellor Buzurjmihr regaining the favour of the same Shah by his success in solving another problem set by Caesar. §§ 26-38. For instances in the Shahnama of kings going incognito to visit foreign courts, see Vol. vi. pp. 325, 335. In the Arabic Tabari, Bahram’s motive for visiting Hind is to see whether by annexing a portion of it he could lighten the taxes of his own


<pb n="6"/>
subjects.<note n="1">NT, p. 106.</note> Unlike his expedition against the Khan of Chin, as Firdausi puts it, and historically against the Haitalians, the one to Hind appears to be wholly fabulous. It is given, however, at length by Tabari and Mir Khand, and mentioned by Mas’udi.<note n="2">Id. RM, I, ii. 360; MM, ii. 191.</note> It will be seen that Bahram in the course of his well-meant efforts to promote the welfare of his subjects does not find it quite so easy as he expected to make everybody happy by legislation. 
</p><p>
§39. Professor Nöldeke is inclined to consider Bahram’s importation of Gypsies from Hind to Iran historical.<note n="3">NT, p. 99 note.</note> The details of course belong to the province of popular legend, but are delightfully characteristic of both parties concerned. The Gypsy language appears to be a debased form of Hindustani. According to Mir Khand the Gypsies intermarried with the Persians, and the Jats were said to be their offspring. Consequently, nearly every Jat is a  musician.<note n="4">RM, I, ii. 357.</note>
</p>

<p>§40. Firdausi is almost alone in his statement that Bahram Gur died in his bed. The common account is that he was killed when out hunting by falling into one of the underground water-courses, so common in Persia, and that his body never was recovered. Popular tradition places the scene of his death in a valley between Shiraz and Isfahan and known as the <quote>Vale of Heroes,</quote> where there are numerous springs supposed to be intercommunicating and of great depth. Sir John Malcolm states that one of his escort was drowned in 1810 when bathing in the identical spring in which Bahram is said to have perished.<note n="5">MHP, i. 94 and note.</note> Tabari lays the scene of the accident in Media, and it took place, if it took place at all, probably not far from Hamadan at a spot called, according to Dinawari, Dih Marj. Nöldeke, however, considers that the whole story was made up to account for the nickname <quote>Gur</quote> bestowed upon Bahram. The word in question means both <quote>onager</quote> and <quote>tomb.</quote><note n="6">NT, 103 and note.</note> The same collocation of letters also means a <quote> Fire-worshipper,</quote> and it is possible that some Muhammadan translator from the Pahlavi may have thought fit to dispatch the guebre to the grave.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><head>How Bahram ascended the Throne, charged the Officers, and wrote Letters to all the Chiefs</head>
<p><pb n="7"/>
<lb/>Whenas Bahram Gur sat upon the throne
<lb/>The sun acclaimed him while the Shah adored
<lb/>The Maker—the all-seeing, watchful World-lord,
<lb/>The Lord of victory and majesty,
<lb/>The Lord of increase and of loss—then said:<q>From Him have I received the throne and crown,
<lb/>For He hath fashioned fortune, and my hopes
<lb/>And fears are all in Him. I give Him thanks
<lb/>For all His benefits; do ye too praise Him,
<lb/>And strive to keep His covenant unbroken.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Iranians answered:<q>We are girt for service.
<lb/>May this crown prove right glorious to the Shah,
<lb/>And may his heart and fortune live forever.</q>
<lb/>Their praises done, all scattered gems before him.
<lb/>Thus said Bahram:<q>O chiefs experienced
<lb/>In daily good and ill! we all are slaves,
<lb/>And God is One, sole-worthy to be worshipped.
<lb/>From fear of evil days we will secure you,
<lb/>And not expose you to malignant Need.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spoke. They rose and homaged him anew.
<lb/>They spent the night in converse, and at sunrise
<lb/>The Shah sat peacefully upon his throne,
<lb/>The Iranians came to audience, and he said:<q>Ye chieftains famed and favored by the stars!
<lb/>Put we our trust in God and joy in Him,
<lb/>Boast not and root out of the world our hearts.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spoke and then those Glories of his court—
<lb/>His chiefs—called for their steeds. The Shah, the third day,
<lb/>Sat on the throne, and said:<q>Religious usage

<pb n="8"/>

<lb/>Must be observed. We witness to God's being,
<lb/>And make our souls familiar with the Faith.
<lb/>There is a Resurrection, Heaven, and Hell,
<lb/>And we cannot escape from good and ill.
<lb/>Ascribe not Faith or knowledge to the man
<lb/>That doubteth of the Day of Reckoning.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The fourth day, donning on the ivory throne
<lb/>The well-loved crown, he said:<q>Men, not my treasures,
<lb/>Are my delight. This Wayside Inn I ask not,
<lb/>And grudge not going, for the other world
<lb/>Is everlasting and this transitory.
<lb/>Abstain from greed and trouble not thyself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The fifth day he said thus:<q>I have no joy
<lb/>In others' toils for mine aggrandizement;
<lb/>We toil in quest of jocund Paradise;
<lb/>He that hath sown but seed of good is blest.</q>
<lb/>The sixth day said he to his subjects:<q>Never
<lb/>May we ensue defeat; we will protect
<lb/>Our troops from foes and make malignants tremble.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The seventh day, when he took his seat, he said:<q>Ye chiefs wise, wary, and experienced!
<lb/>Since with the vile we practise villainy
<lb/>We will have conversation with the wise.
<lb/>Ye that are cold to me shall fare still worse
<lb/>Than with my sire, but ye that do my will
<lb/>Must not experience sorrow, pain, and toil.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The eighth day, when he took his seat, he bade
<lb/>Call Jawan of those about the court,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>To every mighty man,
<lb/>To every chief and clime, indite for me
<lb/>A letter couched in just and loving terms,
<lb/>And say: <q>Bahram hath mounted on the throne
<lb/>With joy—a lord of bounty and of right,
<lb/>A shunner of all fraud and knavery—
<pb n="9"/>

<lb/>For he hath Grace and stature, love and justice:
<lb/>The Judge all-holy is in all his thoughts.
<lb/><q>I will accept,</q> he saith, <q>the obedient,
<lb/>But fault-condoning maketh faults increase.
<lb/>I sit upon my glorious father's throne,
<lb/>I keep the customs of just Tahmuras,<note n="1">For Tahmuras see Vol. i. p. 125.</note>
<lb/>And treat all justly howsoe'er perverse.
<lb/>I will be juster than mine ancestors,
<lb/>And guide you to the Faith—that of Zarduhsht,
<lb/>The prophet—quitting not my fathers' path.
<lb/>I put the Faith of old Zarduhsht before me;
<lb/>The way of that true prophet is mine own.
<lb/>Be ye all sovereign in your own affairs,
<lb/>And guard your marches and your loyalty,
<lb/>Kings of your children and your women-folk:
<lb/>Blest is the man that is both wise and pure.
<lb/>If God accord us life and favouring stars
<lb/>We will not fill our treasury with gold;
<lb/>Such treasures keep the poor in travail. Read
<lb/>This joyful letter which assureth you
<lb/>Of lasting wealth and honour. To all kings
<lb/>Our greeting, most to those whose warp and woof
<lb/>Are love.</q></q></q>
<lb/>They sealed the letters and made choice
<lb/>Of glorious envoys. Archmage, man of lore,
<lb/>And wary cavalier, those letters bore.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How Bahram pardoned the Fault of the Iranians, farewelled Munzir and Numan, and remitted the Iranians' Arrears of Taxes</head>
<p>
<lb/>Next day when Sol rose, when the hills bulked large,
<lb/>And sleep was broken, to Munzir there came
</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1490"/>
<p>
<lb/>A panic-stricken throng and said to him —
<lb/><q>Make intercession for us with the Shah
<lb/>To pardon our offences, for the crimes
<lb/>Of Yazdagird so wrought us that the blood
<lb/>Froze in the nobles’ hearts! So much of foul
<lb/>In word and deed, iniquity, distress,
<lb/>And anguish chilled our hearts toward Bahram
<lb/>Because we suffered so beneath his sire.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Munzir’s warm pleadings mollified the Shah,
<lb/>Who being just and noble pardoned all,
<lb/>Whate’er the fault. He decked the imperial palace,
<lb/>And all the good and great resorted thither.
<lb/>When they had got the place of majesty
<lb/>In readiness they seated there the worthy,
<lb/>In every place they spread the board and called
<lb/>For wine and harp and minstrelsy. Next day
<lb/>Another crowd assembled, yet the chief
<lb/>Was wearied not of giving. On the third
<lb/>There were both revels and festivities,
<lb/>And grief was banished from the world-king’s palace.
<lb/>He told the offices done by Nu’man
<lb/>And by Munzir—those men of stainless birth—
<lb/>On his behalf, and all the chiefs acclaimed
<lb/>Those desert dwellings and those men of war.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah next oped his treasury and filled
<lb/>His palace with brocade and gold, steeds, trappings,
<lb/>Mail-coats and scents,<note>Reading with P.</note> and gems of every hue.
<lb/>He gave all to Nu’man and to Munzir,
<lb/>And Jawanwi told o’er to them the gifts.
<lb/>None matched the Shah in bounty and in travail.
<lb/>He gave the other Arabs many presents,
<lb/>So that they left the royal halls, rejoicing.
<lb/>He then had brought a royal robe of honor,
<lb/>A steed, and raiment of a paladin;
<lb/>These gave they to Khusrau, made much of him,
</p>

<pb n="11"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1491"/>

<p>
<lb/>And seated him upon the glorious throne.
<lb/>Then, turning from Khusrau,<note>Reading with P.</note> the king of kings,
<lb/>Descending from his throne, approached the seat
<lb/>Where sat Narsi—a prince, his younger brother,
<lb/>And one with him in heart and tongue. He made
<lb/>Narsi the captain of the host to set
<lb/>The land in order, gave up to his keeping
<lb/>The host at large, and ravished all the realm
<lb/>With bounty, oped the treasury, and paid
<lb/>The troops who gladdened with dinars. The Shah,
<lb/>That man of lore, then bade Gushasp, the scribe,
<lb/>With prudent Jawanwi, the chief accountant,
<lb/>Approach, and ordered them to cancel all
<lb/>Arrears of taxes for the Iranians.

<lb/>These two wise scribes went to their registers,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1491"/>
<lb/>And in this matter called in aid Kaiwan
<lb/>Because he was the expert of the day,
<lb/>And kept the world’s statistics in his breast.
<lb/>They added up the sum of the arrears,
<lb/>And found it ninety and a hundred times
<lb/>Three hundred thousand drachms. These he forgave,
<lb/>And burnt the registers, and all Iran
<lb/>Rejoiced thereat. Whenas all folk were aware
<lb/>Of that event they praised him mightily.
<lb/>They all flocked to the Fire-temples, to the halls
<lb/>Where New Year’s Day and Sada feast were kept,
<lb/>Flung musk upon the Fire and blessed Bahram,
<lb/>The Shah. Thereafter he dispatched officials
<lb/>To go about the world. He sought and gathered
<lb/>Within a certain city all the exiles
<lb/>Of Yazdagird that thus the monarch’s letter
<lb/>Might reach those noble Persians, and inquire
<lb/>Their wishes, sent each chief a robe of honor,
<lb/>And gave to each a province that befitted
<lb/>His station. Noble, archimage, and marchlord,
</p>

<pb n="12"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1492"/>

<p>
<lb/>Whoever heard Bahram’s deliverance,
<lb/>All visited his court with open hearts,
<lb/>And blithe of countenance. He bade each suitor
<lb/>Repair to the high priest and, when the world
<lb/>Had recognised his bidding, he let stand
<lb/>A herald at his gate thus to proclaim:—
<lb/><q>Ye subjects of the watchful Shah! abstain
<lb/>From sorrow and from sin, and praise henceforth
<lb/>Him through whose justice earth is prosperous.
<lb/>Take refuge from the world with God alone,
<lb/>For He possesseth all and helpeth all.
<lb/>The man that giveth heed to our command,
<lb/>Not turning from our path and fealty,
<lb/>To him will we increase our benefits,
<lb/>And clear our mind of hate and covetise;
<lb/>But whosoever shunneth what is just
<lb/>Shall suffer retribution at our hands.
<lb/>If God hereafter shall vouchsafe us strength,
<lb/>And matters turn out to our heart’s content,
<lb/>We will add benefit to benefit,
<lb/>And ye shall utter praise on our account.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>At these words all the people of Iran
<lb/>Went full of joy and bright of countenance,
<lb/>And, as the sovereignty became secure,
<lb/>Joy waxed and sorrow minished, while the Shah
<lb/>In feasting, horsemanship upon the Ground,
<lb/>In sport and polo, full employment found.

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How Bahram went to the House of Lambak, the Water-carrier, and became his Guest</head>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1492"/>
<lb/>It happened that Bahram Gur went one day
<lb/>With certain warriors to hunt the lion.

<pb n="13"/>
<lb/>An old man, staff in hand, drew near to him,
<lb/>And said: <q>God-fearing Shah! within our city
<lb/>There are two men, one rich, the other poor.
<lb/>Now Barahem, the Jew, a miscreant knave,
<lb/>Is rich in silver and in gold. Lambak,
<lb/>The water-carrier, is of noble nature,
<lb/>Fair-spoken, hospitable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So Bahram
<lb/>Inquired about the two, their words and ways.
<lb/>A worthy said: <q>Lambak, the water-carrier,
<lb/>O great, famed, noble king! is generous,
<lb/>Doth keep a table, and is well disposed.
<lb/>He passeth half the day in water-carrying,
<lb/>The other half in entertaining guests,
<lb/>And leaveth nothing over for the morrow,
<lb/>While Barahem is but a barren Jew,
<lb/>And grasping, and his greed should be exposed.
<lb/>He hath drachms, treasure, and dinars, brocades,
<lb/>And goods of all kinds, but none seeth his bread,
<lb/>And he is ever wrathful at a guest.</q>
<lb/>The Shah then bade a herald: <q>Go, proclaim
<lb/>Before the court: <q>To everyone concerned:
<lb/>The water of the water-carrier,
<lb/>Lambak, is bad to drink.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He stayed till Sol
<lb/>Grew pale, then mounted a fleet steed and came,
<lb/>Like wind, toward the dwelling of Lambak,
<lb/>Knocked with the ring against the door, and cried:
<lb/><q>A captain of the Iranian host am I,
<lb/>The night is dark, and I have far to go.
<lb/>Let me lodge here tonight. I will behave
<lb/>With honour and discretion.</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>Then Lambak,
<lb/>Pleased with the voice of one that spake so fairly,
<lb/>Made answer straight: <q>Come in, O cavalier!
<pb n="14"/>
<lb/>And may the king approve thee. If ten others
<lb/>Were with thee it were better; each had been
<lb/>A moon above my head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Shah Bahram
<lb/>Dismounted, and Lambak saw to the steed.
<lb/>He gladly rubbed it down and haltered it,
<lb/>Then, when Bahram was seated, ran and brought
<lb/>A chess-board<note>According to the poet’s own showing later on, cheas was not intro
duced into Persia till the reign of Nushirwan. See p. 384 seq.</note> and made shift to furnish food,
<lb/>And all things needful, saying: <q>Noble sir!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1493"/> 
<lb/>Put by the chess-men and begin thy meal.</q> <note n="2">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The eating done, the host in high delight
<lb/>Brought out a cup of wine. The Shah was all
<lb/>Amazement at that feast of his, kind speech,
<lb/>And cheery mien, passed night there, and at dawn
<lb/>Woke at the salutation of Lambak,
<lb/>Who said: <q>Thy steed, good sooth, fared ill last night.
<lb/>Stay just this one day with me, and if thou
<lb/>Wouldst have a comrade we will summon one,
<lb/>And find the needful. Joy with me one day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king made answer to the water-carrier:
<lb/><q>I have not much on hand today.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Lambak
<lb/>Departed, taking divers water-skins,
<lb/>But nobody appeared to buy his water.
<lb/>In dudgeon he put off his vest and, taking
<lb/>His porter’s knot and bucket in his arms,
<lb/>Went and procured instead at the bazar
<lb/>Meat and dried curds, and in due course put on
<lb/>The pot. His guest took note of all his trouble.
<lb/>Lambak prepared the meal; they ate and drank,
<lb/>And had another sitting. All that night
<lb/>Bahram had wine in hand; Lambak too loved it.
</p>

<pb n="15"/>
<p>
<lb/>When it was day he hurried to Bahram,
<lb/>And said: <q>Be merry night and day, and free
<lb/>From trouble, grief, and toil. Consort with me
<lb/>For yet another day, for, know, thy presence
<lb/>Is life and goods to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>Now God forbid
<lb/>That we should not be happy for a third day,</q>
<lb/>Bahram said, while the water-carrier blessed him:
<lb/><q>Be merry in thy heart and mate with fortune.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He took to the bazar his water-skins
<lb/>And tackle, which he pledged to some rich man,
<lb/>Bought what he needed and returned in haste
<lb/>Rejoicing to Bahram, and said to him:
<lb/><q>Help with the food, for man must eat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram
<lb/>Took the meat promptly from him, cut it up,
<lb/>And then proceeded with the cookery.
<lb/>When they had eaten they took wine and goblet,
<lb/>And first of all drank to the king of kings.
<lb/>Lambak, when they had drunk, prepared for sleep,
<lb/>And set a candle by Bahram Gur’s couch.

<lb/>The fourth day, when the sun shone and Bahram Gur
<lb/>Awoke, his host approached and said: <q>Famed sir!
<lb/>Thou hast resided in this small, dark house,
<lb/>And doubtless in discomfort; still if thou
<milestone unit="calced" n="1494"/>
<lb/>Fear’st not the Shah stay in my mean abode
<lb/>Two se’nnights more if so thou hast a mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Shah Bahram blessed him and said: <q>Live thou
<lb/>Thy years and months in mirth and happiness.
<lb/>We have been jolly in this house three days,
<lb/>While quaffing to the monarchs of the world,
<lb/>And elsewhere I will speak a word for thee
<lb/>That shall make bright thy heart and plans, for sure
<lb/>Thy hospitality shall yield thee fruit,
<lb/>And, if thou perseverest, thrones and crowns.</q>
</p>
<pb n="16"/>
<p>
<lb/>Dust-swift he put the saddle on his steed,
<lb/>Departed merrily and sought the chase.
<lb/>He hunted on till night the hills ’gan ride,
<lb/>Then lightly from his meiny turned aside.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Bahram went to the House of Baraham, the Jew, who treated him scurvily</head>

<p>
<lb/>He stole away and made toward the house
<lb/>Of barren Baraham, knocked at the door,
<lb/>And said: <q>The Shah hath come back from the chase,
<lb/>But I was left behind. ’Tis night and I
<lb/>Know not the way, can find not Shah and escort.
<lb/>If I may sojourn in this house tonight
<lb/>I will not trouble any one.</q>
<lb/>A slave
<lb/>Went and reported this to Baraham,
<lb/>Who answered: <q>Trouble not thyself hereat,
<lb/>But say: <q>Thou wilt not get a lodging here.</q></q>
<lb/>The messenger departed to Bahram Gur,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is no shelter here for thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>Return to him and say:
<lb/><q>I mean to stop. I ask thee for a lodging
<lb/>Tonight and I will trouble thee no further.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The servant, hearing this, ran back and said:
<lb/><q>This horseman will not budge tonight and saith
<lb/>As much in many words.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Baraham:
<lb/><q>Go instantly and say: <q>This house is small.
<lb/>The Jew is very poor and every night
<lb/>Reposes, bare and hungry, on the ground.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They gave the message, and Bahram Gur said:
<pb n="17"/>
<lb/><q>If here my lodging will prove troublesome
<lb/>I will not enter but will sleep outside
<lb/>The door, ’tis all I want.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Baraham:
<lb/><q>Brave horseman! thoughtlessly<note>Or <quote>grievously.</quote></note> thou troublest me.
<lb/>Were any one to rob thee in thy sleep
<lb/>I should be plagued enough on thine account.
<lb/>Come in if thou art in distress and want,
<lb/>But on condition that thou askest naught.
<lb/>I have not e’en a napkin wherewithal
<lb/>To wipe my body when ’tis washed at death,
<lb/>Or shroud wherein to wind it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram rejoined: <q>I will not trouble thee
<lb/>In any way. Thy portal will suffice.
<lb/>I will be watchman, barring bell and cry.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then Baraham was troubled, and his soul
<lb/>A brake of cares. He thought: <q>This saucy fellow
<lb/>Will not depart. How can I cause him trouble
<lb/>About his steed?</q> then said again: <q>Great sir!
<lb/>Thy many words afflict me. If thy steed
<lb/>Shall leave its droppings here and stale or break
<lb/>The tiles, thou shalt remove its dung at dawn,
<lb/>Sweep up, bear off its refuse to the plain,
<lb/>And pay for any breakages at once.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>I pledge my head to this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Dismounting from his steed he tethered it
<lb/>With its own bridle and unsheathed his sword.
<lb/>He spread his saddle-cloth, used as his pillow
<lb/>The saddle, and reposed upon the floor.
<lb/>The Jew secured the door, brought victuals forth,
<lb/>And sat him down to eat. <q>O cavalier!</q>

<lb/>He said, <q>remember, having heard, this saw:
<lb/><q>Who hath may eat and who hath not look on.</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>I have heard so from of old,</q>






<pb n="18"/>
<lb/>And now I have beheld made manifest
<lb/>What thou hast quoted from a sage’s words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Jew brought wine forth and, when satiate
<lb/>With food and blither for the drinking, bawled:
<lb/><q>O toilful horseman! list this ancient saw:
<lb/><q>He that hath food and purposeth to eat
<lb/>Will offer his thanksgiving for the meat,
<lb/>For one of substance hath a happy mind,
<lb/>And in his wealth a coat of mail will find;
<lb/>But Empty Pockets is a dry-lipped wight,
<lb/>And, like thee, ravenous at mid of night.</q></q>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>’Tis passing wonderful
<lb/>What I have seen, and must not be forgotten,
<lb/>And if thy goblet give thee good at last
<lb/>Then heigh for drinker, wine, and genial cup!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When o’er the mountains Sol displayed its sword
<lb/>Bahram Gur shunned more sleep and put the saddle
<lb/>On his fleet grey. His saddle! Nay, hard pillow.
<lb/>Came Baraham and said: <q>O cavalier!
<lb/>Thou art not faithful to thy word. Thou saidst:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1496"/>
<lb/><q>I will sweep up the droppings of the steed
<lb/>At once.</q> Away with them as thou didst promise.
<lb/>I am annoyed by a dishonest guest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur answered: <q>Go and fetch a slave.
<lb/>He will remove the droppings fast enough,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>And I will give him gold for sweeping up,
<lb/>And bearing off, the refuse to the plain.</q>
<lb/><q>No one have I,</q> he said, <q>to sweep up refuse,
<lb/>Take it away, and fling it in the ditch.
<lb/>Break not thy promises deceitfully;
<lb/>Let me not say that thou hast played the knave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, hearing, took another course.
<lb/>He had a dainty handkerchief of silk
<lb/>Inside his boot, all musk and spicery;
<lb/>He took it out and put therein the droppings,
<pb n="19"/>
<lb/>Then flung them all together in the ditch.
<lb/>Away went Baraham and snatched it up
<lb/>While Shah Bahram stood dazed. <q>Oho!</q> said he,
<lb/><q>Thou scrupulous! If the great king shall hear
<lb/>Of all thy nobleness he will secure thee
<lb/>From want in this world, and will set thee high
<lb/>Among the chiefs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He went back to his palace,
<lb/>And all night long was planning what to do.
<lb/>Within his halls thought banished all repose,
<lb/>He laughed himself but kept the matter close.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How Bahram bestowed the Wealth of Bardham upon Lambak</head>
<p>
<lb/>Next morn he donned his crown and held an audience,
<lb/>Then called to him Lambak, the water-carrier,
<lb/>Who came before him with enfolded arms.
<lb/>They brought withal and quickly Baraham,
<lb/>That curst, malicious Jew. When he arrived
<lb/>They made him sit and called an honest man,
<lb/>To whom the Shah said: <q>Take some baggage-beasts
<lb/>And, acting with the utmost honesty,
<lb/>Go to the house of Baraham forthwith,
<lb/>And look thou bring what thou find’st hoarded there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That honest man went to the Jew’s abode.
<lb/>The house was all brocade, dinars, and raiment,
<lb/>All carpetings, and draperies, and hoards.
<lb/>There was a caravanserai attached,
<lb/>And no room too on earth for all the goods—
<lb/>Gold, silver, every gem, and, on the top
<lb/>Of every bag, a lofty diadem.
<pb n="20"/>

<lb/>The archmage’s reckoning failed. He called for camels,


<lb/>A thousand from the desert of Jahram,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1497"/>
<lb/>And packed the baggage but much still remained.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>That good man drove apace the caravans,
<lb/>And, when the bells resounded from the court-gate,
<lb/>Went and informed the Shah: <q>As many gems
<lb/>Are here as in thy treasury, yet are left
<lb/>Two hundred ass-loads!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thought the Shah, amazed: <q>The Jew hath greatly toiled, but to what profit
<lb/>Since food hath failed him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Bestowed a hundred camel-loads of gold,
<lb/>Of drachms, of carpets, and things great and small
<lb/>Upon the water-carrier. Lambak
<lb/>Departed with his treasures. Then the Shah
<lb/>Called Baraham and said to him: <q>O thou
<lb/>Consorting in thy meanness with the dust!
<lb/>Dost tell me that thy prophet was long-lived,
<lb/>And yet bewail life’s superfluities?<note>If your prophet managed to live long on little so can you.</note>
<lb/>A horseman came and quoted me this saw,
<lb/>Out of the sayings of the past, which saith:
<lb/><q>Hath will enjoy and Hath not withereth.</q>
<lb/>So now withdraw thy grasping hand and watch
<lb/>Henceforth the enjoyment of the water-carrier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then to that vile Jew of the synagogue
<lb/>He spake at large of droppings, handkerchief
<lb/>Gold-woven, and tiles, bestowed upon the knave
<lb/>Four drachms, and said: <q>Take this as capital;
<lb/>No more befitteth thee. To mendicants
<lb/>Thy wealth, to thee thy head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave the poor
<lb/>All that there was. The Jew departed wailing.
<lb/>The Shah gave up the house to plundering;
<lb/>Twas well that other folk should have their fling.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>How Bahram slew Lions and forbade Wine-drinking</head>
<p>
<lb/>He found employment for the hunting cheetah,
<lb/>Bestirred him and was minded for the chase.
<lb/>He mounted him upon a speedy steed,
<lb/>And pricked forth to the plain with hawk on hand.
<lb/>He found a wood that was a rich man’s seat.
<lb/>It was as verdurous as Paradise,
<lb/>And there was neither man nor beast in sight.
<lb/>He said: <q>Here lions should be found. No man
<lb/>Of prudence would sleep here.</q>
<lb/>He entered in,
<lb/>And rode about surveying it. He saw
<lb/>A lion there and that he must employ
<lb/>The scimitar. He shouted at the beast
<lb/>And, when it bravely charged him, rode outside
<milestone unit="calced" n="1498"/>
<lb/>The forest, blazed forth like Azargashasp,

<lb/>And, when the lion followed, strung his bow,
<lb/>A hero he, shot and transfixed the creature
<lb/>Through side and heart; that of the lioness
<lb/>Grew all a-flame, and she too charged Bahram,
<lb/>Roared out and clawed at him. The cavalier
<lb/>Smote with his sword her loins, and that brave beast
<lb/>Gave up the fight. Now in the wood there dwelt
<lb/>A country magnate, a God-fearing man,
<lb/>Whose name was Mihr Bidad. That sword-stroke charmed him.
<lb/>With sweet words on his tongue that old man left
<lb/>The wood, drew near the Shah, blessed him, did reverence,
<lb/>And said: <q>O famous chief! may fortune’s star
<lb/>Be at thy beck. A rural chief am I,
<lb/>O holy one! and owner of this march,
<pb n="22"/>
<lb/>This tilth, and mansion, ox and ass and sheep.
<lb/>Those lions caused me sorrow and despair;
<lb/>Now by thy hand, thy thumb-ring, and thy hilt
<lb/>God hath removed them. Tarry in our wood,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>And I will bring thee milk and wine and honey.
<lb/>I have as many lambs as thou canst want
<lb/>With trees fruit-laden that will furnish shade.</q>


</p>
<p>

<lb/>The Shah alighted and surveyed the forest;
<lb/>He found it verdurous, supplied with streams,
<lb/>And fitted for a young man’s dwelling-place.
<lb/>Then Mihr Bidéd went and fetched minstrelsy
<lb/>As well as divers of the village-chiefs.
<lb/>He slaughtered numbers of fat sheep and came,
<lb/>Gold cup in hand. When they had eaten bread
<lb/>The servants set on cups of wine with roses
<lb/>And fenugreek. The host quaffed one and gave
<lb/>Another to Bahram and took all pains
<lb/>To set him at his ease. When Mihr Biddd
<lb/>Grew blithe with wine he said: <q>Fair-fortuned hero!
<lb/>Thou favourest the Shah or the full moon
<lb/>At midnight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram: <q>Yea, that is so;
<lb/>The King of kings designed this face of mine.
<lb/>He maketh as He willeth, waxing not
<lb/>Nor waning, but if I am like the Shah
<lb/>Then I have given thee this seat and forest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>This said, he mounted, sought his pleasure-palace,
<lb/>Bemused, but sleepless in the garth all night
<lb/>Romanced about the lips of the beloved.
</p><p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1499"/>

<lb/>Next morn he took his seat and called for wine.
<lb/>The captains of the host approached rejoicing,
<lb/>And with the others came a noble man
<lb/>Who from his village brought a gift of fruit—
<lb/>Pomegranate, apple, quince, in camel-loads,
<lb/>And posies fashioned for imperial use.
</p>

<pb n="23"/>

<p>
<lb/>The world-lord, seeing him, saluted him,
<lb/>And seated him among the paladins.
<lb/>The lord that brought the posies and the fruit
<lb/>Bore in the olden tongue the name Kirwi.
<lb/>While he was joying to behold the Shah,
<lb/>The nobles, and the banquet-hall, he spied
<lb/>A crystal goblet filled with wine which proved
<lb/>His ruin. Reaching out among the lords
<lb/>He grasped it, rose, and drank <q>The king of kings!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then cried: <q>A toper I, my name Kirwi.
<lb/>Since in the presence of the king of kings
<lb/>I drain the goblet I will drain again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>This said, he drained the goblet seven times,
<lb/>And distanced all the other revellers.
<lb/>Then by the Shah’s permission he departed
<lb/>To learn if he could bear off all that wine.
<lb/>He left the jovial city for the plain,
<lb/>And when the wine was warm within his breast
<lb/>He galloped from among his retinue
<lb/>Toward the hills, dismounted, chose him out
<lb/>A quiet, shady spot, and slumbered. Came
<lb/>A black crow from the mountains and pecked out
<lb/>His eyes! His escort following found him dead
<lb/>And eyeless with his roadster by his side,
<lb/>And wailed o’er him and at such revelry.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram had wakened in his chamber
<lb/>A courtier came to him, and said: <q>A crow
<lb/>Hath pecked out both Kirwi’s bright eyes while he
<lb/>Was lying drunk among the hills.</q>
<lb/>The world-lord
<lb/>Grew pale of cheek thereat and sorrowful,
<lb/>And from the palace proclamation issued:—
<lb/><q>Ye men of name endowed with Grace and sense!
<lb/>Wine is a thing forbidden in the world
<lb/>Alike to paladin and artisan.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus passed a year while all held wine forbidden
<pb n="24"/>


<lb/>E’en when the Shah himself held revelry,
<lb/>Or called for tales from old time legendry.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>The Story of the young Shoemaker, and how Bahram allowed Wine again</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1500"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now at that time a young shoemaker wedded
<lb/>A virtuous wife, rich and of good repute,
<lb/>But failed in nuptial duty, and his mother
<lb/>Lamented bitterly his grievous case.
<lb/>Howbeit she had some wine in store. She took
<lb/>Her son to her own house and bade the youth:
<lb/><q>Drink seven cups to hearten thee. Perchance
<lb/>Thou mayest break this stubborn seal to-night.
<lb/>How can a woollen mattock mine in stone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He quaffed cups seven or eight, and verily
<lb/>His feet and hide waxed strong. The cups had made
<lb/>The young man confident; he came, achieved
<lb/>His purpose, and then went back to his mother
<lb/>In high delight thereat, and thus it chanced:
<lb/>A lion of the Shah’s had broken loose,
<lb/>And came along the road. Now at the time
<lb/>The shoemaker was still in drink—a sea
<lb/>That made his fingers thumbs. He ran, bestrode
<lb/>The roaring lion, and then reaching out
<lb/>He clutched its ears. The lion had been fed;
<lb/>The youth maintained his seat. Post-haste the keeper
<lb/>Came running after them, a chain in one hand,
<lb/>A lasso in the other. He beheld
<lb/>A shoemaker upon the lion’s back,
<lb/>Perched there like some bold rider on an ass,
<lb/>Ran to the palace-gate, came unabashed
<lb/>Before the Shah, and told about the wonder


<pb n="25"/>
<lb/>That he had seen, with his own eyes, and none
<lb/>Beside had heard. The world-lord all amazed
<lb/>Called the high priest and chiefs, and bade the former:
<lb/><q>See what the stock of this shoemaker is.
<lb/>If he shall prove a paladin by birth
<lb/>’Tis well, for courage fitteth paladins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They sought and asked his mother: <q>Is his rank
<lb/>Above his station?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When the talk grew long
<lb/>She hurried to the Shah and told him all,
<lb/>First doing her obeisance and exclaiming:
<lb/><q>Live happily till time shall be no more.
<lb/>This youth, who had not come to man’s estate,
<lb/>Must take himself a partner and keep house,
<lb/>And then prove impotent! His wife, she said:
<lb/><q>This weakling was self-sown!</q> All privily
<lb/>I gave to him three cups of wine, and none
<lb/>In all the world was ware thereof. Forthwith
<milestone unit="calced" n="1501"/>
<lb/>It flushed his cheeks and made a man of him.
<lb/>Three cups of wine are his nobility;
<lb/>Who could imagine that the Shah would wish
<lb/>To hear thereof? Shoemaker was his granddad,
<lb/>And so is he, and not by birth above
<lb/>His trade.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah smiled on the crone, and said:
<lb/><q>This is no tale to hide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He thus addressed
<lb/>The archmage: <q>Wine is now permissible,
<lb/>And we should drink thereof to his extent
<lb/>Who in his cups still can bestride a lion,
<lb/>And not be overthrown, but not to his
<lb/>Who lieth all dead-drunk upon the road
<lb/>What while some black crow pecketh out his eyes.</q>
<lb/>A proclamation went up from the gate:
<lb/><q>O paladins who wear the golden girdle!
<lb/>Drink wine in moderation, all of you!
<pb n="26"/>
<lb/>Considering the end when ye begin,
<lb/>And when the wine hath led you to delight

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><head>How Riuzbih, Bahram’s High Priest, ruined a Village by a Stratagem and restored it</head>
<p>
<lb/>The third day at the dawn the Shah went forth,
<lb/>He and his men, to hunt upon the plain;
<lb/>Hurmuz, his minister, was on his left,
<lb/>And on his right the holy archimage.
<lb/>They told him tales, discoursing of Jamshid
<lb/>And Faridun. Before them were the hounds,
<lb/>The cheetahs, hawks, and falcons. Thus they shortened
<lb/>The tedious day. Bright Sol was high, but still
<lb/>They saw no trace of deer or onager,
<lb/>And so Bahram Gur, troubled by the heat,
<lb/>Turned back in dudgeon from the hunting-field.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He came upon a verdurous spot fulfilled
<lb/>With houses, men, and cattle. Many folk
<lb/>Came from the settlement to see the troops,
<lb/>But no man did obeisance! Thou hadst said:
<lb/><q>The earth hath tethered every ass of them!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch, vexed and overcome by heat,
<lb/>Had fixed upon that village for a halt.
<lb/>Its folk disgusted him, he viewed them not
<lb/>With favour, and in anger thus addressed
<lb/>The high priest: <q>What an ill-starred spot is this!
<lb/>Be it a lair for wild beasts and for game,
<lb/>And may its streams run pitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archimage,
<lb/>Who took this for an order, turned aside
<pb n="27"/>
<milestone uni="caled" n="1502"/>
<lb/>Toward the village and informed the folk:
<lb/><q>This verdant spot—all fruitage, men, and cattle—
<lb/>Hath greatly pleased Bahram, the king of kings,
<lb/>Who hath a new design respecting it.
<lb/>He raiseth all of you to noble rank
<lb/>To turn this pleasant village to a city.
<lb/>Here, lord and hireling, ye shall be all equal.
<lb/>Men, women, children, ye shall be all chiefs,
<lb/>Each of you be the master of the village.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Glad shouts rose from that prosperous settlement
<lb/>Because the people were all lords alike.
<lb/>Thenceforth, man’s rede or woman’s, 'twas all one,
<lb/>And slave and hireling were their master’s peers.
<lb/>The village-youths, no longer checked by awe,
<lb/>Cut off their elders’ heads, then fell upon
<lb/>Each other and, where roads were not, shed blood.
<lb/>At that to-do folk fled incontinent.
<lb/>The helpless aged remained, but there remained not
<lb/>The implements of culture, goods, and crops.
<lb/>The settlement had ruin in its face,
<lb/>The trees were withered and the streams ran dry,
<lb/>The land and houses were all desolate,
<lb/>And shunned of man and beast. Now when a year
<lb/>Had passed and spring returned the monarch went
<lb/>A-hunting in those parts and reached that spot
<lb/>Erst populous and blithe, and saw the place
<lb/>O’erturned, trees withered, habitations waste,
<lb/>And not a man or beast throughout the march.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thereat the Shah turned pale, the fear of God
<lb/>Came on him, he was grievously distressed,
<lb/>And thus addressed the archmage: <q>O Riuzbih!
<lb/>Alack! this place so jocund once is ruined!
<lb/>Go to now and restore it with my treasures,
<lb/>And take such order that the folk henceforth
<lb/>Be scathless.</q></p>







<p>
<lb/>Going from the royal pesence
<pb n="28"/>
<lb/>The archmage sped forth to that scene of ruin.
<lb/>From street to street he hurried and at last
<lb/>Came on an old man unemployed. Dismounting
<lb/>He spake the elder fair, made him sit down
<lb/>Near by, and said to him: <q>Old, honoured sir!
<lb/>Who wrecked this district once so populous?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The old man answered thus: <q>Our monarch once
<lb/>Was passing through our parts, and thereupon
<lb/>There came to us a witless archimage,
<lb/>One of those useless people with big names,
<lb/>And said to us: <q>Ye all are chieftains here:
<lb/>See that ye pay respect to nobody.
<lb/>Be masters, all of you, both men and women,
<lb/>And great among the great.</q> Such were his words,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1503"/>
<lb/>And all the township was convulsed thereat,
<lb/>All rapine, murder, stick! May God befriend him
<lb/>In like proportion, may grief, death, and hardship
<lb/>Ne’er stale with him. Our case is growing worse,
<lb/>And such that folk must weep for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Ruzbih,
<lb/>Grieved for that old man, asked: <q>Who is your chief?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The other answered: <q>Who will have a place
<lb/>Where there is naught excepting seed and grass?</q>
<lb/>Ruzbih replied: <q>Be thou the governor,
<lb/>Be as the crown upon the head in all things,
<lb/>Make requisition from the world-lord’s treasures
<lb/>For money, oxen, asses, grain, and produce;
<lb/>Bring to the village all the unemployed;
<lb/>They all are subjects, thou alone art chief,
<lb/>And curse no more the ancient archimage,
<lb/>Who spake not as he would in what he said.
<lb/>If thou wilt have assistants from the court
<lb/>I will dispatch them. Ask for what thou wilt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The elder joyed to hear this and was freed
<lb/>From longsome grief. He hied him home forthwith,
<pb n="29"/>
<lb/>Brought others to his Cistern and began
<lb/>To people and apportion out the lands.
<lb/>They borrowed from their neighbours ox and ass,
<lb/>And furnished all the plain. He and his settlers
<lb/>Worked hard and planted many trees on all sides,
<lb/>And, when his labour had restored one piece,
<lb/>The hearts of those that dwelt therein rejoiced.
<lb/>Those that had fled, their heart’s blood in their eyes,
<lb/>Flocked back on hearing of that restoration,
<lb/>And of the toils of that white-headed chief,
<lb/>And reinstated street and water-course,
<lb/>While fowl, ox, ass, and sheep all multiplied
<lb/>Upon the cultured parts, and everywhere
<lb/>Folk planted trees till that waste spot became
<lb/>Like Paradise. The third year he restored
<lb/>The town: the chief was blessed in all his labours.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When jocund spring came round the Shah went forth
<lb/>Upon the plain a-hunting with Ruzbih,
<lb/>The high priest. When the pair drew near the hamlet
<lb/>Bahram Gur suddenly beheld the world
<lb/>All crops and cattle, lofty mansions rose,
<lb/>And all the township thronged with sheep and oxen.
<lb/>Twas all streams, pleasances, and growing crops,
<lb/>And fenugreek and tulips filled the hills,
<lb/>Whereon roamed sheep and lambs, for hill and dale
<lb/>Had grown to be a paradise. The Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1504"/>
<lb/>Said to the high priest: <q>O Ruzbih! what didst thou
<milestone unit="calced" n="1504"/>
<lb/>To make this verdant village waste and scatter
<lb/>Its men and beasts, and what hast thou dispensed
<lb/>In thus restoring it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The high priest answered:
<lb/><q>This ancient seat was ruined by a word,
<lb/>And by a word restored, to please the Shah.
<lb/>He bade me: <q>Take thou treasure and dinars,
<lb/>And make this verdant spot a wilderness,</q>
<lb/>But I feared God and blame from great and small.
<pb n="30"/>

<lb/>When friends, though one in heart, are two in aim
<lb/>’Tis ruin, as I have perceived, to both;
<lb/>So when there are two rulers in a state
<lb/>Their land will be o’erturned. I went and said
<lb/>Thus to the elders of this settlement:
<lb/><q>O men! there is no ruler over you
<lb/>From this time forth, but women, children, slaves,
<lb/>Hirelings and husbandmen, are lords alike.</q>
<lb/>When those who had been underlings became
<lb/>Lords too the nobles’ heads were all brought low,
<lb/>And all the place was ruined by a word.
<lb/>Thus was I far removed from all reproach,
<lb/>And apprehension of God’s chastisement.
<lb/>Thereafter, when the Shah had ruth on them,
<lb/>I went and pointed out another course;
<lb/>I made a wise, old man and eloquent,
<lb/>A man of leading and informed, the ruler.
<lb/>He laboured and restored the waste, rejoicing
<lb/>His subjects’ hearts. When one man ruled, the course
<lb/>Was good, prosperity increased, ill waned.
<lb/>I, unobserved, had shown them what was bad,
<lb/>And opened afterward the way of God.
<lb/>Discourse is better than fine-watered gems
<lb/>When ’tis employed aright. Let wisdom be
<lb/>The Shah, the tongue the paladin, if thou
<lb/>Wouldst have thy spirit easy. May thy heart
<lb/>Be glad for aye and free from wile and waste.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing, cried: <q>Well done, Ruzbih!
<lb/>Thou’rt worthy of a crown!</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur gave
<lb/>That old man worshipful and prescient
<lb/>A purse all filled with gold dinars. For him
<lb/>A robe of honour too they fashioned
<lb/>Of royal stuffs, and cloud-ward raised his head.

<p>
<lb/>Another week the monarch of the world
<lb/>Went forth to hunt with lords and archimages,
<lb/>Prepared to spend a month upon the chase,
<lb/>To revel with his meiny, and to take
<lb/>Illimitable game on waste and mountain.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1505"/>
<lb/>He and his escort reached in merry pin
<lb/>A town. The night came on, and all was dark.
<lb/>The chiefs dismissed the escort and recited
<lb/>Tales of the Shahs. He saw afar a fire,
<lb/>Such as Shahs kindle on Bahman’s high day.<note>The day Bahman of the month Bahman was a time of festivity.</note>
<lb/>The king of kings gazed at the light and spied
<lb/>A pleasant village with a mill before it,
<lb/>Where sat the village-chiefs, while all the maidens,
<lb/>Each with a crown of roses on her head,
<lb/>Were feasting by themselves beside the fire.
<lb/>The minstrels sat about, the maidens sang
<lb/>Tales of the royal wars, and every one
<lb/>Began to tell a story in her turn.
<lb/>They all were moon-faced, all had locks a-curl,
<lb/>All were sweet-spoken, and all savoured musk.
<lb/>They sat ranked on the grass and close before
<lb/>The mill-door, singing, with a posy each,
<lb/>And half bemused with wine and merriment.
<lb/>Then from that scene of revel rose a cry,
<lb/>And one exclaimed: <q>The toast of Shah Bahram!
<lb/>He hath Grace, stature, mien, and love. Before him
<lb/>The rolling sphere upstandeth. Thou wouldst say:
<lb/><q>His face distilleth wine, the scent of musk
<lb/>Proceedeth from his hair.</q> He only hunteth
<lb/>The lion and the onager, and so
<lb/>Folk title him <q>Bahram Gur.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n="32"/>

<p>
<lb/>This he heard,
<lb/>And rode toward them. Drawing near the girls
<lb/>He scanned the plain, beheld it filled with Moons,
<lb/>And saw that he should stop short of the city.
<lb/>He bade, and from the road cup-bearers came,
<lb/>Provided wine and boon-companions,
<lb/>And handed him a crystal cup. Meanwhile
<lb/>Four of the girls, those chief in rank, came forth—
<lb/>One Mushkinab,<note>Mushkinaz in C. and P. Mushkinab means "Pure Musk"; Mushkinak is a species of bird; Naztab is <gloss>Charmer,</gloss>  and Susanak <gloss>Little
    Lily</gloss>.</note> the others Mushkinak,
<lb/>Naztab, and Sasanak. With cheeks like spring,
<lb/>With stately mien, and hand in hand, they went
<lb/>Before the Shah and sang about Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, the wise and prosperous.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur asked, for they perturbed his heart:
<lb/><q>Who are ye,<note>Reading with P.</note> rose-cheeked? Wherefore is this fire?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O cavalier of cypress-height,
<lb/>So like a king in everything! our father
<milestone unit="calced" n="1506"/>
<lb/>Is an old miller who is shooting game
<lb/>Upon this mountain and will come anon
<lb/>Since it is night, and he can see no longer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>With that the miller and his men came bringing
<lb/>Their quarry. When his eyes fell on Bahram Gur
<lb/>He rubbed his face upon the dust and bore him
<lb/>With awe and reverence. The Shah bade give
<lb/>That old man just arrived a golden cup,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Why keepest thou these four
<lb/>With sunny faces thus? Is it not time
<lb/>For them to wed?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The old man offered praise,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is no husband for them; they
<lb/>Are maidens still and pure in chastity,
<lb/>But that is all the property they have,
<lb/>And this is all that I can say for them.</q>
</p>

<pb n="33"/>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram said: <q>Give me all the four, and henceforth
<lb/>Regard them not as daughters.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Quoth the ancient:
<lb/><q>Do not as thou hast said, O cavalier!
<lb/>No cups have we, no land, no crops, no silver,
<lb/>No mansion, ox, and ass.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur said:
<lb/><q>Tis well, for I would have them portionless.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller said: <q>The four shall be thy wives,
<lb/>The handmaids of the dust within thy chambers.
<lb/>Thine eye hath seen their good points and their ill,
<lb/>And, seeing, hath approved.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur said:
<lb/><q>From holy God, the All-giver, I accept them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake and rose. Steeds neighed upon the plain.
<lb/>He bade the eunuchs of his escort bear
<lb/>Those Idols to the royal women’s house,
<lb/>And through the night the troops filed o’er the waste.
<lb/>The miller marvelled, mused all night, and said:
<lb/><q>This moon-like lord so tall
<lb/>And masterful, how came he here by night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>She answered: <q>He perceived the fire from far,
<lb/>The noise the girls were making, and the sound
<lb/>Of minstrels, harp, and revelry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller
<lb/>Said to his wife: <q>Advise me, O my spouse!
<lb/>If this affair will turn out well or ill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>She answered: <q>It is all God’s providence.
<lb/>The man, on seeing them, asked not their race,
<lb/>Thought not of dowry. On earth’s face he sought
<lb/>For Moons and not for money or kings’ daughters.
<lb/>If idol-worshippers saw these in Chin
<lb/>There would be no more idol-worshipping!</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1507"/>
<lb/>Thus till above the Raven’s back the sun 
<lb/>Rose, and the world grew like a shining lamp,
<lb/>They talked at large of base and upright men,

<pb n="34"/>            

<lb/>But with the day the village-chief arrived,
<lb/>And said to that old man: <q>O brave of luck!<note><cit><quote>O vaillant Rouzbeh.</quote> <bibl> Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Good fortune visited thy couch last night!
<lb/>The verdant branches of thy tree bear fruit.
<lb/>One looked, beheld the merriment and fire,
<lb/>And, having turned his horse about, drew near;
<lb/>So now thy daughters have become his wives,
<lb/>And rest securely in his women’s house.
<lb/>By giving them such faces, hair, and carriage
<lb/>Thou didst prepare them for the Shah! Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, is now thy son-in-law!
<lb/>Henceforth thou wilt be famous through the realm.
<lb/>He hath bestowed upon thee all this province
<lb/>And march, so sorrow not, for thou hast 'scaped
<lb/>From cares and fears. Command. Tis thine to bid.
<lb/>We all of us are thralls and bound to thee;
<lb/>We all of us are subject to thee now,
<lb/>Are subject! Rather we are all thy slaves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller and his wife in their amaze
<lb/>Invoked God’s name. The village-chieftain said:
<lb/><q>Such locks as those and countenances too
<lb/>Would bring the sun from his fourth heaven to woo.</q>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><head>How Bahram found the Treasures of Jamshid and bestowed them upon the Poor</head>
<p>
<lb/>Another week he went forth to the chase
<lb/>With favourites from the host and archimages.
<lb/>Swift as the wind there came a loyal liege
<lb/>With spade in hand and asking of the troops
<lb/>Where was Bahram, the Shah, amid the throng?
<lb/>An archimage replied: <q>What wilt thou? Speak.
<pb n="35"/>  
<lb/>Thou canst not see the monarch of the world.</q><note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The man said: <q>Since I may see not his face
<lb/>I will speak not before his followers.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>They brought before the Shah that seeker—one
<lb/>Both learned and eloquent—who seeing him
<lb/>Said: <q>I have words to speak to thee in private.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur turned his horse’s head aside,
<lb/>And rode some distance from his followers’ sight.
<lb/>Then said the man: <q>O world-possessing Shah!
<lb/>Thou must observe my words. A countryman
<lb/>Am I, and landlord here. I own the soil,
<lb/>The homestead, and the crops. I was engaged
<lb/>In making water-courses on my land
<lb/>To benefit my property, and when
<lb/>There was much water, and the stream ran strong,
<lb/>In one place there was formed an orifice,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1508"/>
<lb/>A wondrous clamour reached mine ears, and I
<lb/>Came crying out in terror of my life.
<lb/>The clash of cymbals issued from the stream—
<lb/>A sound denoting treasure.</q><note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>Bahram Gur weal and saw a plain all verdure,
<lb/>And watered, bade bring labourers with spades
<lb/>From far, and lighted from his steed. They pitched
<lb/>His tent among the crops. Night came. The warriors
<lb/>Lit lamps and everywhere enkindled fires.
<lb/>Now when the sun set up above the deep
<lb/>Its banner, burnishing the violet air,
<lb/>The workmen mustered from all sides, as though
<lb/>A mighty army, and began to dig.
<lb/>That portion of the plain was excavate,
<lb/>And, as the workers wearied, there appeared
<lb/>Out of the dust a mount-like place—a mansion
<lb/>Of mortar and burnt brick—like Paradise.
<lb/>They plied their picks; far down a doorway showed.
</p>        
<pb n="36"/>
<p>
<lb/>An archmage, seeing, entered by the door,
<lb/>He and another uninvited guest.
<lb/>They found a single chamber long and wide,
<lb/>And many cubits high. Within it stood
<lb/>Two buffaloes of gold and, fronting them,
<lb/>A golden laver strewn with emeralds
<lb/>And rubies mixed. They seemed two Signs of Taurus,
<lb/>Were hollow, and were filled up with pomegranates,
<lb/>With apples, and with quinces that contained
<lb/>Fine-watered pearls, each like a water-drop.
<lb/>The buffaloes had jewel-eyes, and heads
<lb/>Decayed with age. Ranked round them there were
<lb/>lions
<lb/>And onagers, some having ruby eyes,
<lb/>And others crystal. There were golden pheasants
<lb/>And peacocks, with their breasts and eyes all gems.
<lb/>The minister, whose wisdom was a crown
<lb/>Upon the moon, on seeing that spectacle,
<lb/>Went to the Shah and cried excitedly:—
<lb/><q>Arise. Enough to dower thy treasuries
<lb/>Is here! A chamber filled with precious stones
<lb/>Is manifest, whose key high heaven hath kept!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>His lord said: <q>One of counsel and of might
<lb/>Would write his name upon his treasures. See
<lb/>Whose name is there and when they were amassed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On hearing this the high priest went and saw
<lb/>The impress of the signet of Jamshid
<lb/>Upon the buffaloes, and notified
<lb/>The monarch of the world: <q>I have beheld,
<lb/>And <q>Shah Jamshid</q> is on the buffaloes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1509"/>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>O high priest in all regards
<lb/>More learned than sages! wherefore make mine own
<lb/>The treasures that Jamshid laid up of yore?
<lb/>May nothing e’er be added to my wealth
<lb/>Unless by justice and the scimitar.
<lb/>Bestow the whole upon the poor. God grant
<pb n="37"/>
<lb/>That no mishap befall us. For my troops
<lb/>No share is requisite, our valour openeth
<lb/>The earth to us. As is the use of kings
<lb/>Tis needful that we count up all this wealth,
<lb/>Sell all the gems for cash, and then assemble
<lb/>From desert and from settlement the widows,
<lb/>The orphans, and the impoverished men of name—
<lb/>Those lost to aspiration, fame, and ease—
<lb/>Then take the sum of such, including those
<lb/>That, troubled by their debts, should have a share,
<lb/>And give to them the money and the goods
<lb/>To assoil Jamshid the world-lord’s soul, but I
<lb/>Am youthful still, and sound in wind and limb;
<lb/>Why should I seek his treasures? Let one tenth
<lb/>Be for the finder, who sought out the Shah,
<lb/>But never let him hope for joy hereafter
<lb/>That beareth off the cerecloth from Jamshid.
<lb/>To compass toil in consort with my troops,
<lb/>And treasure and renown from Rum and Chin,
<lb/>That is for me and for my steed, Shabdiz,
<lb/>And for my trenchant scimitar. No shifts,
<lb/>Or shirks, for me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He went back to the treasure
<lb/>Won by his sweat and toil, assembled all
<lb/>The warriors of the realm, and gave his troops
<lb/>A whole year’s pay. He held a feast that spring,
<lb/>Adorned his hall of jewelled tracery,
<lb/>And, when the red wine shone in crystal cups,
<lb/>And he himself was jocund and right glad,
<lb/>He thus harangued his friends: <q/> Exalted ones,
<lb/>Who know the token of the throne of kings!
<lb/>Down from Hushang as far as famed Naudar,
<lb/>Who was a memory of Faridin,
<lb/>And on again right up to Kai Kubad,
<lb/>Who placed the crown of greatness on his head,
<lb/>See who of all these mighty men is left,
<pb n="38"/>
<lb/>And who remaineth to applaud their justice ?
<lb/>Now, since the circle of their years is cut,
<lb/>Their reputation is their monument,
<lb/>Which saith that this had spirit, that had not,
<lb/>And one doth blame them, and another praise.
<lb/>We all shall pass in turn, and not to walk
<milestone unit="calced" n="1510"/>
<lb/>The world for ill is well. Why should I need
<lb/>The treasure of those gone ? Why should my heart
<lb/>Expand toward dinars ? I will not set it
<lb/>Upon this Wayside Inn, or make my boast
<lb/>Of crown, or clutch at treasure. If the days
<lb/>Pass in delight why should the wise eat grief ?
<lb/>Whene’er a liege of mine, a countryman
<lb/>Or courtier, shall complain of mine oppression
<lb/>Then may my head and crown and treasure perish.<q/>
<lb/>There was an ancient man, hight Mahiyar,
<lb/>Whose years had reached eight score and four. He
<lb/>On hearing this, and spake thus: <q/> O just lord !
<lb/>Tales have we heard of Faridun, Jamshid,
<lb/>And others more or less renowned, but none
<lb/>Hath heard of Shah like thee—the lowly’s hope,
<lb/>The Glory of the great—and were the sea
<lb/>Large as thy heart ’twould rise in waves of gems,
<lb/>For from thy soul the radiance of Surush
<lb/>Proceedeth, dwarfing all a wise man’s wit.
<lb/>Thou hast so lavished treasure in the world
<lb/>That no one great or small hath seen the like.
<lb/>When men spake of the era of Jamshid,
<lb/>And of the treasure of the buffaloes,
<lb/>None wotted where it was—beneath the dust,
<lb/>Or in the dragon’s breath—but having found it
<lb/>Thou didst not look thereon, for thou didst scorn
<lb/>This Wayside Hostelry. Good sooth! no king
<lb/>Hath seen, nor will a hundred see, such jewels
<lb/>As these in any sea, yet these and all
<pb n="39"/>
<lb/>The buffaloes and onagers thou gavest
<lb/>Without exception to the poor! May crown
<lb/>And girdle never lack thee. Health be thine,
<lb/>Be victor thou and fortune’s favourite.
<lb/>The ink would blacken many a royal roll
<lb/>To tell this tale and yet not reach the end.
<lb/>Thou being gone thy name will live in praise
<lb/>When folk recount the story of thy days.<q/></p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><head>How Bahram, returning from Hunting, went to the House of a Merchant and departed displeased</head>

<p>
<lb/>One day, another week, he went to hunt,
<lb/>When indisposed, and took his bow and arrows.
<lb/>The plain grew sultry with the blazing sun.
<lb/>He came back from his hunting leisurely,
<lb/>And reached a merchant’s house, to whom he said,
<lb/>On looking round and seeing none beside :
<lb/><q>Canst give us lodging since thou wilt not find us
<lb/>A trouble ? </q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1511"/>
<lb/>Having helped him to dismount
<lb/>The merchant found a place for him. The Shah,
<lb/>Complaining of the colic, gave the merchant
<lb/>Some drachms, and said: <q> Toast some old cheese
<lb/>with almonds.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The merchant did not do as he was asked,
<lb/>Not having almonds by him, but, at night-fall
<lb/>And at his leisure, got a hot roast fowl,
<lb/>And served it to Bahram upon a tray,
<lb/>Who said : <q> I asked thee for old cheese, besought thee
<lb/>To bring it, and thou hast not brought it me
<lb/>Although I gave thee drachms and had complained
<lb/>Of colic.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said the merchant : <q> Foolish fellow !
<pb n="40"/>
<lb/>Thy soul is starving through thy lack of wit.
<lb/>Since I have brought to thee this hot roast fowl
<lb/>Mere shame should stay thee asking aught beside.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram thereat ceased longing for old cheese.
<lb/>Grieved at his words he ate, referring not
<lb/>To what had passed. When it was sleeping-time
<lb/>He slept and said naught further to the merchant.
<lb/>Now when the sun rose o’er the heaving deep,
<lb/>And when the Cloak pitch-hued had disappeared,
<lb/>The wealthy merchant said to his apprentice :—
<lb/><q>O simpleton ! why didst thou buy a fowl
<lb/>Not worth a drachm for more and wrong me 50 ?
<lb/>Had’t been a proper fowl then he and I
<lb/>Had fallen not out last night, or hadst thou spent
<lb/>A quarter of a drachm in buying cheese
<lb/>He would have been to me like milk and water
<lb/>To-day.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The apprentice answered : <q>Tis all one.
<lb/>Know that the fowl is at my charge. Be thou
<lb/>And he my guests, so quarrel not with me
<lb/>About the bird.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram arose
<lb/>From pleasant sleep he sought his docile steed
<lb/>To saddle it and go back to his palace,
<lb/>And from his palace raise his crown to Saturn.
<lb/>The apprentice, seeing him, said to Bahram :—
<lb/><q>Give to thy slave thy company to-day.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah returned, sat down again, and marvelled
<lb/>At fortune. Then the youth went out and fetched
<lb/>Two hundred almonds and addressed his master :—
<lb/><q>Bestir thee, sir ! and have these almonds toasted,
<lb/>Make ready too some cheese and some new bread,
<lb/>For such the cavalier asked yesterday,
<lb/>Bring food and spread the board.</q>
<lb/>He went before
<pb n="41"/>
<lb/>Bahram and said: <q>O cavalier! I bring thee
<milestone unit="calced" n="1512"/>
<lb/>All hot what yesterday thou didst require,
<lb/>And there is more to follow in due course.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus saying he set off to the bazar,
<lb/>A different sort of purchaser. He bought
<lb/>More almonds, sugar, fowl, and lamb to make
<lb/>An ample meal, wine, saffron, musk, rose-water,
<lb/>And hurried home. He brought the board all spread
<lb/>With dainty meats. A sprightly youth was he
<lb/>And well disposed. The eating done, he brought
<lb/>Forth cups of wine, first serving king Bahram,
<lb/>And thus, till blithe and jocund, they proceeded
<lb/>From eating to the cup. The Shah addressed
<lb/>His entertainer thus: <q> Bahram will be
<lb/>Inquiring for me, but do ye drink on,
<lb/>Grow drunk, and budge not till ye prove yourselves
<lb/>Wine-worshippers.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then rubbing down and saddling
<lb/>Shabdiz he started, blithe with wine, for court,
<lb/>First saying to the merchant : <q> Toil not so
<lb/>In quest of gain, O thou that sellest dear !
<lb/><q>Thou wouldst have sold me for a quarter drachm
<lb/>Yestreen, sewn up the eyes of thine apprentice
<lb/>Because he bought a fowl above the price,
<lb/>And have put me within the dragon’s maw.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake and sped back to his royal seat.
<lb/>Now when the sun displayed its crown in heaven
<lb/>The guardian of the world sat on his throne
<lb/>Of ivory and bade the chamberlain
<lb/>Seek out the merchant and conduct him thither
<lb/>With his apprentice. One of them was glad,
<lb/>The other glum. Bahram, on seeing the apprentice,
<lb/>Made much of him and seated him rejoicing
<lb/>Among the lords. They brought to him a purse,
<lb/>And made his awe-gloomed spirit like the moon.
<lb/>Then to the merchant said Bahram : <q> Know this:
<pb n="42"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1513"/>
<lb/>Thou shalt be slave for life to thine apprentice,
<lb/>And, further, pay him twice in every month
<lb/>Three score drachms from thy savings. With thy goods
<lb/>He shall be entertainer and make laugh
<lb/>The hearts of noble men.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then to the high priest :—
<lb/><q>The king that disregardeth this world’s doings,
<lb/>How can he know what man is truly great,
<lb/>Or how discern the evil from the good?</q>
<lb/>So now, O sage that seekest wisdom’s way,
<lb/>If thou must have a saw hear what I say :—
<lb/>Avoid all avarice if man thou be,
<lb/>Or be indeed below humanity.<q/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><head>How Bahram slew a Dragon and went to a Yokel’s House</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram abode a season with his lords,
<lb/>With sparkling wine, with cup, and minstrelsy.
<lb/>Spring came, the ground seemed Paradise, the air
<lb/>Sowed tulips on earth’s face, all tracts grew full
<lb/>Of game, and in the brooks the waters seemed
<lb/>Like wine and milk. The deer and onager
<lb/>Paced in the dales or clustered on the sward,
<lb/>The blackbirds haunted all the river-banks,
<lb/>And all around them bent pomegranate-blooms.
<lb/>‘Tis long, the nobles said to Shah Bahram Gar,
<lb/>Since we have hunted onager.

<p>
<lb/>He answered :—
<lb/><q>Choose we a thousand horsemen from the host,

<p>
<lb/>The royal hunter went. He found the world
<lb/>All hues and scent. His gallant chieftains swept it
<lb/>For onager, gazelle, and mountain-sheep—
<lb/>A labour that extended o’er two days—
<lb/>What while Bahram had wine in hand; the third,
<lb/>When Sol illumed its crown, when earth grew golden,
<lb/>And hill and stream became as ivory,
<lb/>The valiant Shah went to the chase and saw
<lb/>A dragon like a lion. From its head
<lb/>Hair hung down to the ground, and it had breasts
<lb/>Like those of women. Then Bahram Gar strung
<lb/>His bow and shot forthwith a poplar arrow
<lb/>Against the dragon’s chest. He shot another
<lb/>Straight at its head, and gore and venom flowed
<lb/>Adown its front. The king dismounted, drew
<lb/>His sword, and carved up all the dragon’s breast.
<lb/>It had gulped down a youth and frozen him
<lb/>In blood and bane. Bahram bewailed him sorely
<lb/>What while the venom blinded his own eyes.
<lb/>He took the corpse out of the dragon’s maw,
<lb/>Ne’er may its head and breast unite again.
<lb/>He rode off dizzied, suffering, and longing
<lb/>For sleep and water, reached a settlement,
<lb/>Arriving at a house-door from the waste,
<lb/>And saw a woman shouldering a pitcher.
<lb/>She veiled her face from him. He said to her :—
<lb/><q>Can I lodge here or must I toil on still ?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She said: <q>Brave horseman! treat this house as thine.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this he rode his courser in.
<lb/>His hostess called her husband. <q>Bring a wisp,</q>
<lb/>She said, <q>and rub his steed. At feeding-time
<lb/>Feed from the sack.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1503"/>
<lb/>She went to her own chamber,
<pb n="44"/>
<lb/>Swept out the house and laid down mat and pillow,

<lb/>Drew water, and berated to herself
<lb/>Her spouse the while: <q>The fool will ne’er bestir
<lb/>Himself on seeing some one in the house.
<lb/>This is not women’s work, but for my part
<lb/>I, soldier-like, can only grin and bear it!</q>
<lb/>She brought and spread the board with vinegar
<lb/>And salad, bread and curds. Went Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And bathed his face, for he had been o’erwrought
<lb/>In fighting with that dragon. So he ate
<lb/>A little, then lay down and groaned, his face
<lb/>Concealed beneath a kerchief made in Chin.
<lb/>The woman, when she woke, said to her spouse:—
<lb/><q>O knave with unwashed face! thou shouldest slay
<lb/>A lamb because this cavalier is great,
<lb/>And of the royal seed, hath kingly bearing,
<lb/>And moon-like Grace, and he is like to none
<lb/>Save Shah Bahram.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Her mean spouse said to her:—
<lb/><q>Why such to-do? Thou hast no salted meat,
<lb/>No fire-wood, and no bread, and spinnest not
<lb/>A-nights as others do. When thou hast killed
<lb/>A lamb, and he—this cavalier—hath eaten
<lb/>And gone, then go, buy, mingle with the throng;
<lb/>The winter, cold, and blast undoubtedly
<lb/>Will come on thee no less.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>So spake her spouse.
<lb/>She hearkened not, for she was good and wise,
<lb/>And in the end her husband slew a lamb
<lb/>At her entreaty for the cavalier.
<lb/>When it was slain she made a pot of broth,
<lb/>And lit a fire with half-burnt sticks, then brought
<lb/>The tray with eggs thereon and water-cresses,
<lb/>A roasted leg of lamb and everything
<lb/>That she had cooked. Bahram, when he had washed
<pb n="45"/>
<lb/>His hands, his dinner done, felt indisposed
<lb/>For slumber and still ailed. Now when the night
<lb/>Foregathered with the sun the woman fetched
<lb/>Wine and a harp. <q>O woman of few words!</q>
<lb/>The Shah said, <q>tell to me some old-world tale
<lb/>That while thou art reciting I may quaff
<lb/>To chase away my pain and cares. I give thee
<lb/>Free speech about the Shah for praise or blame.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That woman of few words said: <q/>Yea, 'tis well,
<lb/>For he is first and last in everything.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram responded: <q/>He is so indeed,
<lb/>But he is just and good to nobody.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That dame of spirit said: <q/>O honest man!
<lb/>This place hath many folk and many homes,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1515"/>
<lb/>And always cavaliers are passing through
<lb/>From public offices and ministers.
<lb/>If one of them shall call a man a thief
<lb/>The accused will have much trouble afterward.
<lb/>The cavalier to compass some few drachms
<lb/>Will make the poor man's life a misery,
<lb/>Or one may smirch some honest woman's fame,
<lb/>And make her fall to folly. This is loss,
<lb/>Because the treasury is none the richer.
<lb/>This is our trouble with our Shah, the world-lord.<q/>
<lb/>The king grew full of thought at that account—
<lb/>How those in power were wronging his good name—
<lb/>And then the pious Shah thought with himself:—
<lb/>No one doth praise the just. Henceforward I
<lb/>Will play the tyrant for a while that love
<lb/>And justice may grow manifest from ill.<q/>
<lb/>Vexed by dark thoughts he passed a sleepless night,
<lb/>His heart allied to tyranny the while.
<lb/>Now when Sol rent its musky-scented veil,
<lb/>And showed its face in heaven, the woman left
<lb/>The house and bade her spouse: <q/>Bring pot and fire,
<lb/>And in the water put all kinds of grain
<pb n="46"/>

<lb/>Before the sun shall see it. Mind it well
<lb/>While I go milk the cow.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She brought the cow
<lb/>From pasture, got much grass, and threw it down
<lb/>Before her; then she tried the udders, crying:—
<lb/>In God's name who hath neither mate nor peer!<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She found the udder milkless, and the heart
<lb/>Of that young hostess aged. She told her husband:—
<lb/>Good man! our monarch's heart hath changed in purpose,
<lb/>The world's king hath become tyrannical!
<lb/>A secret change came o'er his heart last night.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: <q/>What words are these? Why go and croak?<q/>
<lb/>She thus replied: <q/>My dear one! what I say
<lb/>Is sober truth, for when the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Hath grown unjust the moon may shine not forth
<lb/>In heaven, the udders are dry, the musk-bags lose
<lb/>Their scent, adultery and guile are rampant,
<lb/>The tender heart becometh flinty, wolves
<lb/>Devour folk on the waste, the sage doth flee
<lb/>The fool, and eggs are addled 'neath the hens
<lb/>What time the Shah becometh tyrannous.
<lb/>The pasture of this cow had minished not,
<lb/>Her watering-place supplied her as before,
<lb/>Yet is her udder dry, her lowing changed.<q/>
<lb/>On hearing this the Shah forthwith repented,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1516"/>
<lb/>And prayed to God: <q/>O Thou who art supreme,
<lb/>Almighty, and the Arbiter of fortune!
<lb/>If e'er my heart shall turn away from justice
<lb/>Then be the throne of kings no longer mine.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That blesséd dame, who worshipped holy God,
<lb/>Tried with her hand the udder once again,
<lb/>She tried it in the Lord's name, saying thus:—
<lb/>Cause Thou the milk to flow.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The milk flowed forth.
<pb n="47"/>
<lb/>The good wife cried: <q/>O God, our Succourer!
<lb/>Thou hast recalled to justice the unjust,
<lb/>For, if not so, this virtue were not his.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then said she to the master of the house:—
<lb/>The justice of the unjust is restored.
<lb/>Laugh and rejoice; this is the Maker's boon
<lb/>To us.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the porridge had been cooked,
<lb/>And man and wife had done that chare, the good dame,
<lb/>And after her the master of the house,
<lb/>Who bare the tray, went to their guest. Upon it
<lb/>There was a bowl of porridge, oh! how good
<lb/>Had it been but some broth! The Shah ate somewhat,
<lb/>Then spake thus to that kindly dame: <q/>Take thou
<lb/>This whip outside and hang it where folk pass.
<lb/>Choose out a proper bough because the wind
<lb/>Must harm it not, then note the passers by
<lb/>With one eye on the whip.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good-man went
<lb/>Forthwith, he hung the whip upon a tree,
<lb/>And kept his eye thereon a while. There came
<lb/>Innumerable troops along the road,
<lb/>And all that saw the whip there hailed Bahram.
<lb/>They lighted down before that lengthy whip,
<lb/>And passed saluting. <q/>Tis the Shah, none else!<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good-man told his spouse. <q/>Naught but the throne
<lb/>Could fit a face like that!<q/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then full of awe
<lb/>Both ran to him and cried: <q>O Shah! O great!

<lb/>O mighty one! O sage, high priest and world-lord!
<lb/>A humble woman and her gardener-spouse
<lb/>Have been thy poor hosts in this house. Withal
<lb/>They did not do their best. We ne’er suspected
<lb/>That ’twas the Shah, that such an one as he
<lb/>Would come to this place as a guest, would come
<pb n="47"/>
<lb/>To this poor home of ours.</q>
<lb/>Bahram replied:—
<lb/><q>Good friend! I give to thee this march, the land,
<lb/>And village. Be thou ever hospitable;
<lb/>Be that, and give up garden-work.</q>
<lb/>He spoke,
<lb/>And laughing left the house, got on his steed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1517"/>
<lb/>Wind-footed, and from that poor village reached
<lb/>His jewelled halls. The nobles of Iran
<lb/>Went thither for the chase, three hundred strong,
<lb/>And each with thirty servants in his train
<lb/>Of Turkman, Raman, or of Persian strain.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>How Bahram went to the Chase and espoused themDaughters of the Thane Barzin</head>

<p>
<lb/>The third day after this the Shah went forth
<lb/>With escort, the equipment for the chase,
<lb/>Ten camels all in housings of brocade
<lb/>With stirrups silver and with dossers gold,
<lb/>Ten camels with the Shah’s pavilion,
<lb/>And his brocaded seat. In front of these
<lb/>Were seven elephants which bare the throne
<lb/>Of turquoise dyed like Nile; its feet were all
<lb/>Of gold and crystal; ’twas the throne itself
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram Gur. Every swordsman there
<lb/>Had thirty pages who had golden belts
<lb/>And bridles, while a hundred camels served
<lb/>To bear the minstrels wearing massive crowns.
<lb/>The falconers had eight score hawks with them,
<lb/>And ten score noble peregrines and falcons.
<lb/>Among them there was one bird black of hue,
<pb n="49"/>
<lb/>More precious in the Shah’s eyes than the rest,
<lb/>With sable talons and with yellow beak,
<lb/>Like gold a-gleam on lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>They called it a tughral. Its eyes were like
<lb/>Two goblets full of blood. The Khan of Chin
<lb/>Had sent it with a throne and crown, with amber,
<lb/>A golden torque inlaid with emeralds,
<lb/>With two score armlets, and with thrice twelve earrings,
<lb/>Three hundred camel-loads of rarities
<lb/>Of Chin, and fifteen score of ruby signets.
<lb/>Behind the falconers they led eight score
<lb/>Of cheetahs for that Lustre of the world—
<lb/>The Shah—with jewelled torques and chains of gold.
<lb/>Thus came the king of kings upon the plain,
<lb/>And raised his crown o’er Jupiter. The sportsmen
<lb/>Made for the river whither used the Shah
<lb/>Auspiciously to fare each seventh year.
<lb/>As they drew near they found the river full
<lb/>Of water-fowl. He had the tabor beaten,
<lb/>And the tughral flew off. The imperious bird
<lb/>Was all impatience; in its claws a crane
<lb/>Was helpless quarry, and a pard had been
<milestone unit="calced" n="1518"/>
<lb/>Its proper prey. At length it soared from sight,
<lb/>And bound a crane, then soared again and flew
<lb/>Like shaft from bow, the falconer pursuing.
<lb/>The Shah was vexed that it had flown away,
<lb/>And followed by the tinkling of its bells.
<lb/>He came upon a spacious pleasure-ground,
<lb/>With mansion rising in a coign thereof,—
<lb/>And thither went with certain of his men,
<lb/>The rest remaining on the hunting-field.
<lb/>On entering Bahram Gur saw a garden
<lb/>As ’twere a mountain-skirt. Upon the ground
<lb/>Brocade was spread, and all the place was full
<lb/>Of slaves and wealth. A pool was in the centre
<lb/>Whereby an old man sat. Three girls like ivory
<pb n="50"/>
<lb/>Sat by him wearing turquoise crowns. Their cheeks
<lb/>Were like the spring, their statures tall, their eyebrows
<lb/>Arched, and their tresses lassos; each girl held
<lb/>A crystal goblet, and Bahram Gar saw them.
<lb/>His eyes were dazzled at the spectacle
<lb/>Just as his heart was gloomed for his tughral.
<lb/>On seeing him that wealthy thane grew pale
<lb/>As fenugreek with fear. A wise old man
<lb/>Was he, Barzin by name, but ill-affected
<lb/>Toward the Shah. As swift as wind he left

<lb/>The hauz,<note>1 See Vol. i. p. 208 note.</note> approached the Shah, and kissed the ground,
<lb/>Then said: <q>O monarch of the sun-like face!
<lb/>May heaven revolve according to thy will.
<lb/>I do not dare to say to thee: <q>Abide
<lb/>With thy two hundred horsemen on my march.</q>
<lb/>Still, if the Shah take pleasure in my garden,
<lb/>The glory of Barzin hath reached the moon.</q>
<lb/><q>Today,</q> the world’s king answered, <q>the tughral
<lb/>Escaped us. I am vexed about that fowler,
<lb/>Which hunted birds as leopards hunt their quarry.</q>
<lb/>Barzin replied: <q>I saw a sable bird
<lb/>Just now with golden bells and pitch-hued body,
<lb/>Its beak and talons turmeric in hue;
<lb/>It came and settled on yon walnut-tree:
<lb/>By thy good fortune it is come to hand.</q>
<lb/>The Shah said to a servant: <q>Go and look.</q>
<lb/>He went like wind and cried: <q>Glad ever be
<lb/>The world-lord! The tughral is on a bough;
<lb/>E’en now the falconer is taking it.</q>
<lb/>The hawk thus found, the old man said: <q>O Shah
<lb/>Without a mate or equal on the earth!
<lb/>Oh! may thine entertainer prove auspicious,
<lb/>And all the wearers of a crown thy slaves.</q>

</p>

<pb n="51"/>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1519"/>
<lb/>Call for a wine-cup in our present joy,
<lb/>And, when thou art refreshed, ask what thou wilt.</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king of kings dismounted at the pool,
<lb/>And old Barzin grew glad. With that there came
<lb/>Bahram’s chief minister and therewithal
<lb/>The captains of the host and treasurer.
<lb/>Barzin brought forth a golden cup and first
<lb/>Drank to the monarch of the world, then brought
<lb/>And offered to the Shah a cup of crystal,
<lb/>Who seeing took and drained the proffered draught
<lb/>Below the inscription-line, whereat Barzin
<lb/>In high delight had wine-jars set about
<lb/>The place, and in his cups said to his daughters:—
<lb/><q>My clever chicks! no chieftain of the host,
<lb/>But Shah Bahram hath visited this garden!
<lb/>So come, thou songstress! let us have a song,
<lb/>And thou, my moon-faced daughter! bring thy harp.</q>
<lb/>All three drew near the Shah, and on their heads
<lb/>Were jewelled crowns. One danced, another played
<lb/>Upon the harp, the third possessed a sweet
<lb/>And soothing voice. While they made minstrelsy
<lb/>The king of kings in high contentment drained
<lb/>His goblet dry. He said thus to Barzin:—
<lb/><q>What girls are these who live with thee in joy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Barzin thus answered him: <q>O Shah! may none
<lb/>Behold the age without thee. Know that these
<lb/>Are mine own daughters and my heart’s delight.
<lb/>One is a caroler, another harpeth,
<lb/>The third observeth measure in the dance.
<lb/>I need not aught, O Shah! for I have money,
<lb/>Domain, and pleasure-ground, and my three daughters
<lb/>Are, as the Shah perceiveth, like glad spring.
<lb/>O moon-face!</q> said he to the songstress, <q>fear not,
<lb/>But sing a song about the Shah.</q>
</p>
<p><lb/>The Idols
<pb n="52"/>
<lb/>Took heart to sing and play. The songstress sang:—
<lb/><q>O moon-faced king! the moon in heaven
<lb/>Alone is like to thee,
<lb/>The royal throne thine only seat.
<lb/>Thou with thy moon-like blee,
<lb/>And teak-like stature art the pride
<lb/>Of throne and crown. Oh! rare
<lb/>For those that see thy face at morn,
<lb/>For those that scent thy hair!
<lb/>Thy loins are tiger-like, thy limbs
<lb/>Are mighty, thy crown’s Grace
<lb/>Is as the cloud-rack high, and like
<lb/>Pomegranate-bloom thy face.
<lb/>For rapture of thy love hearts laugh,
<lb/>Like ocean is thine own;
<lb/>Like cloud thy hand. As thy fit prey
<lb/>I see the lion alone.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1520"/> Thou splittest with thy shaft a hair,
<lb/>And by thine equity
<lb/>Convertest water into milk.
<lb/>When hostile armies see
<lb/>Thy lasso and thy puissant arm
<lb/>Their hearts and brains are rent
<lb/>However mighty their array,
<lb/>Howe’er on battle bent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, having heard the ditty, drained
<lb/>The massive crystal cup and thus addressed
<lb/>Barzin: <q>O noble sir, experienced much
<lb/>Is this world’s heat and cold! thou wilt not find
<lb/>A better son-in-law than me who am
<lb/>'Mid kings a hero and the king of men.
<lb/>Bestow thy daughters on me—all the three—
<pb n="53"/>
<lb/>And I will raise thy coronet to Saturn.</q>
<lb/><q>O king!</q> Barzin replied, <q>may wine and bearer
<lb/>Find favour in thy sight. Who will dare say
<lb/>That he hath such a Venus in his house?
<lb/>If now thou wilt accept me as a slave
<lb/>To serve before the throne of king of kings
<lb/>Then will I pay my service to thy crown,
<lb/>Thy throne, thy Grace, thy fortune, and thy state;
<lb/>Moreover my three daughters are thy handmaids
<lb/>To stand before thee as thy slaves. The Shah
<lb/>Approved of them as such or ever he
<lb/>Saw these three Moons afar. As teaks are they
<lb/>In stature and as ivory in hue,
<lb/>Fit for the throne and to adorn the crown.
<lb/>Now will I tell the monarch of the world
<lb/>What fortune I possess for good and ill:
<lb/>Of clothes and carpets, stuffs and draperies,
<lb/>Good sooth have I stored up in mine abode
<lb/>Two hundred camel-loads or more as well
<lb/>As necklaces and bracelets, crowns and thrones,
<lb/>All for my daughters’ pleasure.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>Leave what thou hast in store,
<lb/>Where now it is, and seek mirth with the wine-cup.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The elder answered: <q>My three moon-like daughters
<lb/>I give thee by the rites of Gayomart
<lb/>And of Hushang. Dust are they 'neath thy feet,
<lb/>And all the three live but to do thy will.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The eldest daughter’s name was Mah Afrid,
<lb/>The second’s Faranak, and the cadette’s
<lb/>Was Shambalid. Approving them at sight
<lb/>The Shah preferred them 'mongst his lawful wives,
<lb/>And bade a noble of his escort bring
<lb/>Four golden litters,<note>The fourth was for himself and needful. See below.</note> and, when all three Idols
<lb/>Were set therein, they were encircled there
<pb n="54"/>
<lb/>By forty Ruman slaves—their devotees—
<lb/>Who called down praises on them as they went,
<lb/>While they departed to their golden home
<lb/>The glorious Shah caroused. A servant hung
<lb/>His whip above the court-gate, for the escort,
<lb/>Save by the token of the whip, ne’er knew
<lb/>Where Shah and nobles were. When any one
<lb/>Beheld the handle and its lengthy thong
<lb/>He used to run thereto and do obeisance.
<lb/>Bahram drank on until he was bemused,
<lb/>Then gloriously took his seat within a litter,
<lb/>And went back to his women’s golden house—
<lb/>The house that was perfumed with ambergris.
<lb/>On his return he tarried for a week,
<lb/>And much he feasted, lavished, and held converse.
<lb/>The eighth day he went hunting with Ruzbih,
<lb/>And with a thousand cavaliers. He saw
<lb/>That all the plain was full of onager,
<lb/>Drew from its case his royal bow, and strung it,
<lb/>Invoking God who giveth victory.
<lb/>Twas springtide and the onager were pairing.
<lb/>From all the world they met confronting there,
<lb/>And rent each other’s hides, the face of earth
<lb/>Was reddened with their blood. Bahram abode
<lb/>While two bucks fought together furiously,
<lb/>Then when the valiant buck that gained the day
<lb/>Was covering a doe he laughed to see
<lb/>The onagers, took hold upon his bow-string,
<lb/>Shot, piercing the buck’s flank so that the arrow
<lb/>Went home up to its plumes, and skewered buck
<lb/>And doe together, thrilling all his escort.
<lb/>All who beheld that shot acclaimed the Shah:—
<lb/><q>Oh! be the evil eye far from thy Grace,
<lb/>And may thy whole life be a festival.
<lb/>Such might as thine the age ne’er saw till now;
<lb/>At once Shah, warrior, and king art thou.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><head>How Bahram slew Lions, went to the House of a Jeweller, and married his Daughter</head>

<p><pb n="55"/>
<lb/>The Shah, on urging thence his steed Shabrang,
<lb/>Came on a forest and beheld before it
<lb/>Two savage lions, strung and drew his bow.
<lb/>The arrow, striking on the lion’s breast,
<lb/>Was buried to the plumes. Forthwith Bahram
<lb/>Turned to the lioness and, shooting, pinned
<lb/>Her breast and loins together, but exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>The shaft was featherless, the point was blunt,
<lb/>If point there were.</q>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1522"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The escort praised him, saying:—
<lb/><q>O famous king of earth! none ever saw,
<lb/>Or will see, on the throne of king of kings
<lb/>A Shah like thee, who with unfeathered arrows
<lb/>O’erthrowest lions, and with plumed uprootest
<lb/>A mount of flint.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch with his meiny
<lb/>Rode on along the meadow-land and saw
<lb/>A forest full of sheep, their herds in flight
<lb/>For fear of harm. The chief herd, ne’er at ease
<lb/>For terror of wild beasts, perceived Bahram,
<lb/>Who said to him: <q>What man is driving sheep
<lb/>To this unlikely spot?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The head man answered:—
<lb/><q>Great sir! none cometh to this pasturage
<lb/>Except myself. They are a jeweller’s:
<lb/>I drove them from the mountains yesterday.
<lb/>The owner is a wealthy man not troubled
<lb/>By fear of loss. He owneth gems by ass-loads,
<lb/>Gold, silver, trinketry. He hath withal
<lb/>One only daughter, skilful on the harp.
<lb/>Her tresses cluster on her head in curls.
<pb n="56"/>

<lb/>He will take wine from her hand only. None
<lb/>Hath seen an old man like him. How could he
<lb/>Have kept his property but by the justice
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram? The great king of the world
<lb/>Is not concerned for gold, and his archmages
<lb/>Are not unjust; but say who slew these beasts,
<lb/>For may the Ruler of the world uphold him?</q>

</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>This pair of lions fell
<lb/>Beneath the arrows of a valiant man,
<lb/>Who, having slain these gallant beasts, departed
<lb/>With seven other gallant cavaliers.
<lb/>Where is the jeweller’s mansion? Point the way,
<lb/>And hide it not from us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The chief hind said:—
<lb/><q>Proceed and thou wilt reach a brand-new seat.
<lb/>The jeweller thence fareth to the city,
<lb/>To Shah Bahram’s own palace, but, what time
<lb/>The sun doth don its Sable Silk, returneth
<lb/>To banquet. Revelling and sound of lyre
<lb/>Will reach thine ears if thou wilt bide a while.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram, on hearing this, called for his steed,
<lb/>And for apparel suited to a king,
<lb/>Then parted from his minister and escort.
<lb/>Good sooth! but he was full of eagerness!
<lb/>Ruzbih said to the chiefs: <q>So now the Shah
<lb/>Is going to the village, there to knock
<lb/>Upon the portal of the jeweller!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1523"/>
<lb/>And, mark my words! will ask of him his daughter,
<lb/>And crown her doubtless with a crown of gold,
<lb/>Will take her to his ladies’ golden house,
<lb/>And send that other three back to Barzin!<note n="1">See previous section.</note>
<lb/>He never hath enough of chambering;
<lb/>His consort flitteth ere the night is over!
<lb/>He hath above a hundred ladies’ bowers!
<lb/>Tis ill to have a king of kings like this.

<pb n="57"/>

<lb/>Just now a eunuch reckoned up nine hundred
<lb/>And thirty damsels wearing jewelled crowns
<lb/>Within the palace, all provided for!
<lb/>The Shah demandeth tribute from all lands,
<lb/>And Rum will be exhausted in a year.
<lb/>Alack! for shoulders, breast, and height like his,
<lb/>And face that brightened all the company!
<lb/>None will behold his like in strength and stature,
<lb/>Who pinneth with one shaft two onagers;
<lb/>But dalliance with women marreth him,
<lb/>He soon will be as feeble as a ghost!
<lb/>His eyes will darken and his looks grow wan,
<lb/>His body slacken and his cheeks turn blue.
<lb/>To sniff at women maketh hoary heads,
<lb/>And hoary heads have naught to hope on earth.
<lb/>As polo-playing maketh stoop the upright,
<lb/>So womanizing causeth every ill.
<lb/>Once in a month is intercourse enough,
<lb/>While more is waste of blood. A wise youth too
<lb/>Should husband vigour for his children’s sake.
<lb/>In this excess there is excess of loss,
<lb/>And slackness is afflictive to a man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They went back to the palace, talking still,
<lb/>And one remarked: <q>The Sun hath lost his way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, with one slave to mind his horse,
<lb/>Fared through the gloom of night and, when he neared
<lb/>The jeweller’s abode, heard sounds of harping,
<lb/>Whereto he urged Gulgun, his steed, forthwith
<lb/>Toward the merchant’s house. He knocked and asked
<lb/>Admittance, all the while invoking Him
<lb/>Who made the sun. A kindly handmaid said:—
<lb/><q>Who's there? Why knock thus at this time of night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>This morning as the Shah
<lb/>Was coming from the hunting-ground my horse
<lb/>Went lame, and I perforce got left behind.

<pb n="58"/>
<lb/>Here in this thoroughfare the folk will steal
<lb/>A steed like this and my gold harness too,
<lb/>So I need help.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The handmaid went and told
<lb/>Her lord: <q>A man requesteth shelter, saying:
<lb/><q>My steed with its gold harness will be stolen,
<lb/>And I shall go away undone.</q></q>
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/><q>Then ope the door. Hast never seen a guest
<lb/>Come here before?</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1524"/>
<lb/>The maid made haste to open,
<lb/>And said: <q>Come in, my son!</q>
<lb/>The Shah on entering,
<lb/>And seeing such a place and such attendance,
<lb/>Said to himself: <q>O just and only God!
<lb/>Thou art Thy servant’s Guide to what is good.
<lb/>Ne’er may I be but just in conduct, never
<lb/>Be covetous and arrogance my creed,
<lb/>Let every act and deed of mine be just,
<lb/>And let my subjects’ hearts rejoice in me:
<lb/>Then, if my knowledge and my justice wax,
<lb/>My memory will shine when I am dead.
<lb/>May all my subjects, like this jeweller,
<lb/>Enjoy the sound of harp and revelry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On entering the lofty hall he saw
<lb/>The jeweller’s famed daughter from the door.
<lb/>The thane, on seeing him, arose and came
<lb/>With bows profound, and said: <q>Good ev’n to thee.
<lb/>May all thy foemen’s hearts be rooted out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The host spread out a mat and laid thereon
<lb/>A cushion, gazing at his guest with joy.
<lb/>One brought a sumptuous board with viands hot
<lb/>And cold thereon. One came—a faithful liege—
<lb/>And was instructed to secure the steed.
<lb/>Elsewhere they lodged and fed Bahram Gar’s servant.
<lb/>They set a low seat for the host himself,
<pb n="59"/>
<lb/>Who took his place close to his guest the Shah,
<lb/>And then began to offer his excuse,
<lb/>Thus saying to Bahram: <q>Brave paladin!
<lb/>Since thou art entertained within my house
<lb/>Conform thyself to my rough usages.
<lb/>When we have eaten we must drink and then
<lb/>Rest sweetly. Tis dark night, the wine is royal;
<lb/>When thou hast drunk thy quantum thou shalt sleep,
<lb/>And, when thou wakest at the break of day,
<lb/>Must haste back to the service of the Shah.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>Night dark when one alighteth
<lb/>On cheery host like thee! We must not prove
<lb/>Ingrate to God; the hearts of thankless men
<lb/>Are full of fear.</q>
<lb/>The handmaid, who was all
<lb/>Astonied at the aspect of the guest,
<lb/>Brought water, bowl, and napkin. Hands were washed,
<lb/>Then came the wine-cup’s turn, and with the wine
<lb/>Came mirth, contentment, and tranquillity.
<lb/>The handmaid brought a flagon and strong drink,
<lb/>Red wine, a cup, and flowers of fenugreek.
<lb/>The thane first reached out for the cup and drank,
<lb/>Then washed it out with musk and with rose-water,
<lb/>And gave the cup that cheereth to Bahram.
<lb/><q>What,</q> said he, <q>is my boon-companion’s name?
<lb/>Now will I make a covenant with thee,
<lb/>And I will take Bahram, the Shah, as surety.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king laughed heartily thereat and said:—
<lb/><q>Gushasp, the cavalier, am I, and hither
<lb/>Came I attracted by the sound of harp,
<lb/>And not to drink or while away the time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>This girl of mine,</q> his host replied, <q>exalteth
<lb/>My head to heaven and is at once my harper,
<lb/>And my cup-bearer, and withal she singeth,
<lb/>And dissipateth care. My Heart’s Delight
<lb/>Is named Arzi—my heart’s delight and server.</q>

<pb n="60"/>

<lb/>He said to that tall Cypress: <q>Bring thy harp,
<lb/>Come in thy loveliness before Gushasp.</q>
<lb/>The harpist, tall as a pomegranate-tree,
<lb/>Moved stately to the king of kings and said:—
<lb/><q>O chosen cavalier who hast in all
<lb/>The semblance of a king! know that this house
<lb/>Of feasting is thine own, my sire thy host
<lb/>And treasurer. May thy dark nights be joyous,
<lb/>And be thy head exalted o’er the rain-clouds.</q>
<lb/>He said to her: <q>Sit down, take up thy harp,
<lb/>And let us have a song immediately.
<lb/>To-night old Mahiyar shall be a youth,
<lb/>And pledge his soul as hostage for his guest.</q>
<lb/>The harpist clasped her harp and first she played
<lb/>The Magians’ chant, and as the silken chords
<lb/>Rang out an odour as of jasmine filled
<lb/>The room. She sang to Mahiyar, her sire,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>How plaintive is her harp!</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>Thou art as a cypress
<lb/>That lippeth a stream,
<lb/>And white locks encircle
<lb/>Thy cheeks’ rosy gleam.
<lb/>Thy tongue is warm-spoken,
<lb/>Thy heart loveth peace,
<lb/>Oh! ne’er may thy foemen
<lb/>Of ill have surcease.
<lb/>Thy soul’s food be wisdom.
<lb/>Thy bent is as great
<lb/>As Faridun’s. On thee
<lb/>As handmaid I wait.
<lb/>Arzi am I titled,
<lb/>I joy in our guest,
<lb/>Like monarch whose troops are
<lb/>With victory blest.</q>
</p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p>
<lb/>This ditty done, toward the guest she turned,
<lb/>Turned toward him with a song and plaintive chords:—
<lb/><q>Sincere and brave, high-starred and king-like one!
<lb/>They that ne’er saw Bahram, the cavalier,
<lb/>The well approved, to every bosom dear,
<lb/>Should look upon thy face, and all is done.
<lb/>His only semblance in the host thou art,
<lb/>Tall as a cypress with a reed-like waist,
<lb/>A cypress with a pheasant’s carriage graced,
<lb/>An elephant in bulk with lion’s heart.
<lb/>Two miles in fight thou flingest forth thy spear,
<lb/>Thy cheeks as though pomegranate-blossoms shine
<lb/>(Who was it washed, say’st thou, those blooms in wine?)
<lb/>And as a camel’s thighs thine arms appear.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1526"/>

<lb/>Thou tramplest Mount Bistan. Heaven toiled to mould
<lb/>A man like thee. None see I to compete
<lb/>In strife with thee. As dust beneath thy feet
<lb/>Oh! may Arzi’s form be while life shall hold.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The girl’s proficiency with song and harp,
<lb/>Her looks, her stature, and accomplishments,
<lb/>So wrought the world-lord that thou wouldst have said:—
<lb/><q>His heart hath grown a magazine of woes,</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>And at the time when Mahiyar grew drunk
<lb/>Before him he addressed his host, thus saying:—
<lb/><q>Give me thy daughter as my lawful wife
<lb/>If thou wouldst be commended for just dealing.</q>
<lb/><q>Wilt thou accept,</q> said Mahiyar to her,
<lb/><q>The presents of this lion-hearted man?
<lb/>See if he pleaseth thee, and if ’tis well
<lb/>For thee to go with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Arzi replied:—

<pb n="62"/>
<lb/><q>Good, noble father!<note>Reading with P.</note> if thou wouldst bestow me
<lb/>On any then my partner is Gushasp,
<lb/>The cavalier. One that doth look upon
<lb/>A man like this will bid Bahram <q>Avaunt!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>His daughter’s words misliked him and he said
<lb/>Thus to Bahram: <q>O horseman of the fray!
<lb/>Regard her carefully from head to foot,
<lb/>Her industry, her knowledge, and discretion;
<lb/>See if she be approved of thee at heart;
<lb/>Report of her is better than assumption.
<lb/>She is at once accomplished and no beggar;
<lb/>I do not specify exact amounts,
<lb/>But shouldst thou count the gems of Mahiyar
<lb/>They would exceed those in the royal coffers.
<lb/>Be not precipitate, take rest to-night,
<lb/>And, if needs must, another cup of wine,
<lb/>For great men make no compacts in their cups
<lb/>Especially about their lady-loves.
<lb/>Wait therefore till the sun shall rise on high,
<lb/>And till the nobles’ heads have roused from sleep,
<lb/>Then will we call far-seeing elders—
<lb/>Disinterested men and scholarly.
<lb/>At night ’tis out of order and ignoreth
<lb/>The precedents of Faridun, the Shah.
<lb/>Ill-omened ’tis to marry in one’s cups
<lb/>Or handsel any business.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram:—
<lb/><q>Absurd! ’Tis ill to draw, or go by, omens.
<lb/>This harpist pleaseth me to-night, so strive
<lb/>To deem the matter an auspicious one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The sire said to his daughter: <q>O Arza!
<lb/>Dost thou approve him as to looks and manners?</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>Yea, I approved of him when I
<lb/>Far off beheld him with such head and eyes.

<pb n="63"/>
<lb/>Complete the work and leave the rest to God:
<lb/>The sky is not at feud with Mahiyar.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Her father answered: <q>Thou art now his wife.
<lb/>Know this that thou art under coverture.</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1527"/>
<lb/>He gave her to Bahram Gur who espoused her;
<lb/>By dawn the matter had been consummate.
<lb/>The Shah’s attendant hung the royal whip
<lb/>Upon the door of Mahiyar, Arzi
<lb/>Went to her chamber while on every side
<lb/>Folk still were sleeping. Mahiyar departed
<lb/>To make all ready for the cavalier,
<lb/>Gushasp, and told a servant: <q>Shut the doors,
<lb/>And send off someone to the flock in haste.
<lb/>They must not serve the board without a lamb,
<lb/>And one well fattened too. Wait on Gushasp,
<lb/>And, when he waketh, bring him ice and sherbet,<note>Fakké’. See Vol. i. p. 43 note.</note>
<lb/>Take too a bowl of camphor and rose-water
<lb/>To scent his chamber. As for me, my cups
<lb/>Have left me just as I was yesterday;
<lb/>Old jewellers shirk not their wine.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake,
<lb/>And, drawing up his cloak about his head,
<lb/>Wooed rest and sleep.
<lb/>When bright Sol showed its crown,
<lb/>And earth became like shining ivory,
<lb/>Troops armed with shields and double-headed darts
<lb/>Went to seek traces of the royal whip.
<lb/>The escort gathered round the door as though
<lb/>The Shah’s own court, and all that recognised
<lb/>The whip came forward and saluted it.
<lb/>The porter, seeing that great gathering,
<lb/>The throng of swordsmen and of javelin-men,
<lb/>Went, roused his sleeping lord, and sobered him,
<lb/>Thus saying to him: <q>Rise, bestir thyself;
<lb/>This is no time to sleep or place to sit,
<lb/>Because the world’s king is thy guest within
<lb/>This sorry house of thine!</q>
<pb n="64"/>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1528"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The jeweller’s heart
<lb/>Throbbed wildly at the words. He cried: <q>What say'st thou?
<lb/>How tracest thou the footsteps of the king?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then fully realising what was said
<lb/>He sprang up from the bed-clothes with a shout,
<lb/>Enraged against the porter, <q>These,</q> he cried,
<lb/><q>Are not the words of wisdom and of age.</q>
<lb/><q>Experienced man!</q> the slave said, <q>who on earth
<lb/>Made thee the monarch of Iran? So vast
<lb/>A host is at thy gate that, wouldst thou pass,
<lb/>There is scant room, and every Jack of them,
<lb/>On coming up, saluteth our old curtain!<note>The felt curtain at the door-way. Cf. p. 69.</note>
<lb/>At dawn, before the sun began to shine,
<lb/>The cavalier’s attendant came and hung
<lb/>A whip all gold and jewels o’er our entry,
<lb/>Where we pass through it, and round that long whip
<milestone unit="calced" n="1528"/>
<lb/>There is a world of folk from hill and dale.
<lb/>So now be up and doing, be not slack,
<lb/>And let not wine affect thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this,
<lb/>The shrewd old man was troubled: <q>Why did I
<lb/>Get drunk last night before the king of kings,
<lb/>And let my daughter share the wine with us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then going to the chamber of Arzi
<lb/>He said: <q>My gracious Moon! it was Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, that last night visited
<lb/>The jeweller! On coming from the chase
<lb/>He hither turned his steed. Now up and don
<lb/>Brocade of Rum and set upon thy head
<lb/>Thy last night’s crown. Make him an offering
<lb/>Of jewels worthy of a king—three rubies
<lb/>Of royal worth—and, when thou shalt behold
<pb n="65"/>
<lb/>His sun-like face, enfold thine arms before him,
<lb/>Keep thine eyes fixed on him and think of him
<lb/>As thine own soul and body. Answer meekly
<lb/>When he shall question thee, and let thy words
<lb/>Be modest and discreet. I shall not come
<lb/>Unless he calleth me and giveth me
<lb/>A place among his followers. I sat
<lb/>At table with him like his peer! Oh! would
<lb/>That I had no bones in me! Furthermore
<lb/>I cottoned with the Shah when in my cups!
<lb/>Wine maketh old and young to misdemean.</q>
<lb/>Just then a slave came hurrying and said:
<lb/><q>The Shah, that ardent spirit, is awake.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the Shah woke safe and sound, he went
<lb/>To bathe him in the garden, went to pray
<lb/>Before the sun, confiding all to God.
<lb/>Returning thence to the reception-room
<lb/>He bade a server bring a cup of wine,
<lb/>Heard that his retinue had come, dismissed it,
<lb/>And called Arzi on whom his heart was set.<note>Arzu means <gloss>Desire</gloss>, and there is a double use of the word in the
<lb/>original: <q>Because he had a desire for Desire.</q></note>
<lb/>Arzi appeared with wine and offerings—
<lb/>A handmaid with her necklace and her earrings—
<lb/>And with a lowly reverence kissed the ground.
<lb/>The Shah smiled on her greatly pleased and said:—
<lb/><q>Whence such behaviour—first to make me drunk,
<lb/>Then run away? Thy song and harp suffice
<lb/>For me, a woman’s presents are for others.
<lb/>Come sing to me thy ditties of the chase,
<lb/>Of spearhead-blows, and royal combatings.</q>
<lb/>Anon he said: <q>Where is the jeweller,
<lb/>For we got drunk together yesternight?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The daughter, when she heard this, called her father,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1529"/>
<lb/>Mazed at the Shah’s good-nature. Came her sire
<lb/>With folded arms before the sun-like king





<pb n="66"/>
<lb/>Of kings, and said: <q>O Shah! O chief! O wise!
<lb/>O great! O mighty one! O warrior!
<lb/>O archimage! may this world ever be
<lb/>At thy dispose and everywhere thy name
<lb/>Associate with the crown. The man that quaffeth
<lb/>The draught of foolishness should hold his tongue.
<lb/>My fault was due to ignorance. Methinks
<lb/>That thou must deem me mad. Vouchsafe to pardon
<lb/>My fault and make my face and faring bright.
<lb/>I stand—a foolish slave—before thy door;
<lb/>The king of kings will deem me less than man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>The wise man never taketh
<lb/>The drunkard seriously; one should not eye
<lb/>Or savour wine if it make sad the face.
<lb/>I saw thee not ill-tempered in thy cups.
<lb/>Now listen to the singing of Arzu,
<lb/>And proffer as thine own apology
<lb/>The tulips and the jasmine of her song.
<lb/>Let her descant what while we quaff, not counting
<lb/>The ill of days not come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He kissed the ground,
<lb/>Did Mahiyar, then brought and spread the board,
<lb/>And, good man that he was, he fetched withal
<lb/>The nobles that were stationed at the gate;
<lb/>Howbeit Arzi went off to her own bower,
<lb/>Her visage puckered at those stranger-guests,
<lb/>And stayed till heaven grew sombre, and the stars
<lb/>Came out around the moon. The eating done,
<lb/>Arzi was called and set upon a seat
<lb/>Of golden work. The Shah bade her to take
<lb/>Her harp and sing to him the song that he
<lb/>Had asked of her already. Thus she sang:—
<lb/><q>O monarch undaunted! the lion in shame
<lb/>Will slink from the wood at the bruit of thy name.
<lb/>Shah, victor, host-breaker art thou. In thy mien
<pb n="67"/>
<lb/>The tints of the tulip on jasmine are seen.
<lb/>In stature no ruler on earth is thy peer,
<lb/>In looks thou transcendest the moon in her sphere.
<lb/>A host on the war-stead, beholding in fight
<lb/>Thy helmet, will rive, heart and brain, with affright,
<lb/>And longer discern not the depth from the height.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When they were blithe with wine and, eating done,
<lb/>Were quaffing draught on draught, Ruzbih appeared
<lb/>Before the Shah. They lodged him in the village.
<lb/>Ruzbih had brought a litter and withal
<lb/>Two score of eunuchs, all moon-faced and charming.
<lb/>Those Roman’s faces seemed brocade of Rum,
<lb/>And freshened all the country round. Arzi,
<lb/>A crown of jewels set upon her head,
<lb/>Toward the bower of Shah Bahram Gur sped.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><head>How Bahram went to the Chase and passed the Night at the House of Farshidward</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1530"/>
<lb/>The king of kings, attended by Ruzbih,
<lb/>Went from the chief’s house with a gladsome heart.
<lb/>He passed the night and went at dawn to hunt.
<lb/>Troops fared o’er all the roads and trackless wastes,
<lb/>And thus abode a month. They pitched the tents
<lb/>And camp-enclosure, and swept all the field
<lb/>Of game. None slumbered there, it was all wine,
<lb/>Game, flesh, and harp, and lyre. They kindled fires
<lb/>About the plain and burned wood green and dry.
<lb/>There came a swarm of dealers from the city,
<lb/>Who tarried at the camp for trafficking:
<lb/>The crowd made bright the waste. At quarter price
<lb/>They bought one onager or ten gazelles,
<lb/>And whosoever was in want of meat,
<lb/>For cooking for his guests or for his children,
<pb n="68"/>

<lb/>Might carry home ground-game and water-fowl
<lb/>By ass-loads.
<lb/>When a month had passed Bahram
<lb/>Grew eager for his wives’ society,
<lb/>And led his people from the hunting-ground.
<lb/>Folk could not see the way, the cavaliers
<lb/>Raised such a dust! but swift as dust they sped
<lb/>Till day’s cheeks turned to Lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>The Shah observed a town in front of him
<lb/>With groups of houses, roadways, and bazaars,
<lb/>And ordered that his escort with the baggage
<lb/>Should push on, leaving not a soul behind.
<lb/>He asked: <q>Where is the chief man of the place?</q>
<lb/>And then made thither straightway. He beheld
<lb/>A shattered entry broad and deep. The owner
<lb/>Came and saluted him. The Shah inquired:—
<lb/><q>Whose ruin is this and wherefore in such plight
<lb/>Amidst the town?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The master said: <q>Tis mine,
<lb/>And ill luck is my guide. I have not here
<lb/>Kine, raiment, victuals, manhood, understanding,
<lb/>No feet, no wings. Me thou hast seen, now view
<lb/>My house—one fitter for a curse than blessing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The aspiring Shah alighted, scanned the house,
<lb/>And hands and feet both failed him, for the place
<lb/>Was all sheep's droppings though both great and vaulted!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1531"/>
<lb/><q>Bring me,</q> he said, <q>thou hospitable man!
<lb/>Somewhat whereon to sit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The other answered:—
<lb/><q>Why mock thy host so wantonly, O marchlord!
<lb/>Had I some draperies my guest would praise me,
<lb/>But I have none, no clothing, food, or carpets.
<lb/>Pray lodge thee somewhere else; here all is poor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Fetch a cushion then that I
<lb/>May sit awhile.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>The place is ill,</q> he answered.
<pb n="69"/>
<lb/><q>Good sooth! wouldst thou have bird’s milk?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram:—
<lb/><q>Bring fresh milk and new bread if thou canst get it.</q>
<lb/><q>Imagine,</q> said the other, <q>that thou hast
<lb/>Partaken and gone off with <q>Fare thee well.</q>
<lb/>I should not be so lifeless had I bread,
<lb/>Though life were better far than bread to me.</q>
<lb/>Bahram said: <q>If thou hast no sheep how come
<lb/>These droppings here?</q>
<lb/><q>Tis night,</q> the other answered.
<lb/><q>My head is all a muddle with thy talk.
<lb/>Select some mansion with a curtained entrance;
<lb/>The master of it will commend thy choice.
<lb/>Why shouldst thou be with an unfortunate,
<lb/>Who maketh leaves his pillow for the night?
<lb/>Thou hast a golden sword and stirrups, thou
<lb/>Shouldst sojourn not where there is fear of thieves,
<lb/>For thieves and lions haunt old hulks like this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>If a thief should rob me now
<lb/>Thou wouldst not be responsible, but give me
<lb/>A lodging for the night, 'tis all I need.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>Then need it not,</q> the owner made reply;
<lb/><q>None lodgeth in my house.</q>
<lb/><q>O wise old man!
<lb/>Why art thou,</q> said the Shah, <q>so short with me?
<lb/>Still thou wilt give me, I presume, cold water,
<lb/>O noble one!</q>
<lb/><q>Didst thou not see,</q> rejoined
<lb/>The householder, <q>more than two bow-shots long<note>Or "hence. So Mohl.</note>
<lb/>The pool? There drink and take whate’er thou wilt.
<lb/>Why seek for aught in this impoverished house?
<lb/>Good sooth! hast never seen a poor man barred
<lb/>From working by decrepitude?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram
<lb/>Rejoined: <q>Thou art not one of the first water,

<pb n="70"/>
<lb/>Chief though thou be; so strive not with a soldier.
<lb/>What is thy name?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Farshidward,
<lb/>A man without land, raiment, sleep, and food.</q>
<lb/>Bahram asked: <q>Why endeavour not for provand
<lb/>And comfort?</q>
<lb/>Said the master of the house:—
<lb/><q>He that bestoweth all may end my days.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1532"/>

<lb/>If only I can see my desolation
<lb/>Relieved of thee I will make prayer to Him.
<lb/>Why cam’st thou to an empty house that never
<lb/>Saw good condition and a high estate?</q>
<lb/>When he had spoken thus he wept so sorely
<lb/>That Shah Bahram fled from his cries. He laughed
<lb/>At that old man and took the road again,
<lb/>While all his escort followed in his train.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><head>How a Bramble-grubber revealed the Case of Farshidward, and how Bahram bestowed that Householder’s Wealth upon the Poor

<p>
<lb/>Bahram, on quitting that famed township, came
<lb/>Upon a bramble-brake. A man, who held
<lb/>A mattock in his hand, was grubbing there.
<lb/>The monarch left his retinue, drew near him,
<lb/>And said; <q>O enemy of brambles! whom
<lb/>Know’st thou of most account in yonder town?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Farshidward—a man of greed
<lb/>That doth not suffer him to sleep or eat.
<lb/>He hath, may be, a hundred thousand sheep,
<lb/>More camels, steeds, and asses. Earth is full
<lb/>Of his amassed dinars, but would that he
<lb/>Had neither skin nor marrow to his body!
<pb n="71"/>
<lb/>- A famished paunch and nakedness are his;
<lb/>He hath no child, no kin, no friends, no goods.
<lb/>A captive in the hands of Greed and Need
<lb/>His person is all misery and wasted
<lb/>Through eating not, but if he were to sell
<lb/>For gold his tilth ’twould purchase gems enough
<lb/>To fill a house! His shepherds swill down flesh
<lb/>With milk, but he himself hath millet-bread
<lb/>Without e’en cheese! He never saw two coats
<lb/>At once; he is a tyrant to himself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said to the grubber: <q>Thou dost know
<lb/>The number of his sheep, but knowest thou
<lb/>Where those flocks are and likewise where his steeds
<lb/>And camels are at large?</q>
<lb/>The grubber said:—
<lb/><q>O thou! it is not far from here to where
<lb/>His camels and his sheep are, but my heart
<lb/>Is troubled at the ill that he may do me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur gave the grubber some dinars,
<lb/>And said: <q>This day shall gentle thy condition.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He bade one of his escort come to him,
<lb/>A man that knew his way about, by name
<lb/>Bihruz, a horseman brave and popular,
<lb/>And sent with him a hundred cavaliers,
<lb/>Selected men well suited to the work.
<lb/>He chose withal a scribe, an honest man
<milestone unit="calced" n="1533"/>
<lb/>And skilled accountant. <q>Go,</q> he told the grubber,
<lb/><q>Thou didst grub brambles, now reap gold. One hundredth
<lb/>Of all that wealth is thine. Show to these men
<lb/>The way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The grubber’s name was Dilafruz,
<lb/>A man of stately mien and stalwart form.
<lb/>Bahram bestowed on him a noble steed,
<lb/>And said: <q>Thou must companion with the wind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He was the Light of hearts but he became

<lb/>Twelve thousand, and the number of the camels
<lb/>And steeds as twice ten thousand. All the waste
<lb/>Was dinted with their hoofs. Beside the stream
<lb/>There were three hundred thousand camel-loads
<lb/>Of potted butter and curds fresh and dried.<note>For winter use.</note>
<lb/>Height, waste, and level were one mighty cache,
<lb/>But none had heard thereof. Bihruz, the son
<lb/>Of Har, reported to the king of kings,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, praising first almighty God,
<lb/>The All-victorious and All-nourisher,
<lb/>And next the king of kings who had released
<lb/>Men’s hands from toil, and then proceeded thus:—
<lb/><q>O monarch of the world! thou art the joy
<lb/>Of all folk great and small because thy justice
<lb/>Surpasseth bounds. Our treasury hath suffered
<lb/>Through silence as to this man’s wealth. Tis well
<lb/>That all things in the world should have their bounds,
<lb/>Well that the Shah be boundlessly rejoiced.
<lb/>A wretch there is named Farshidward, unknown
<lb/>In feast and fight to great and small alike
<lb/>Throughout the world, not fearing God or Shah,
<lb/>And thankless in respect of what he hath.
<lb/>While thus he streweth o’er the world his wealth
<lb/>He is a lack-all, wretched, secretive,
<lb/>Who is as unjust as the Shah is just.
<lb/>Blame not my words and counsel. Let this wealth
<lb/>Inaugurate a treasury; 'twill need




<pb n="73"/>
<lb/>Three years to order it. I have invoked
<lb/>To mine assistance certain other scribes,
<lb/>And settled them upon this fertile mount,
<lb/>But, though the writers’ backs are bent, not yet
<lb/>Is manifest the sum of this man’s treasure;
<lb/>Moreover he possesseth, so folk say,
<lb/>Still greater buried hoards of gold and jewels.
<lb/>Here in the mountain am I with both eyes
<lb/>Upon the road to know the Shah’s commands.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1534"/>
<lb/>My salutation to him. May he live
<lb/>What while his name is all in all to all.</q><note>Lit. <gloss>is (both) warp and woof.</gloss></note>
<lb/>He sent a cameleer post haste to bear
<lb/>The letter to the Shah. Whenas Bahram Gur
<lb/>Had read it he was troubled in his heart,
<lb/>Grew downcast, wept, and bent his warrior-brows.
<lb/>He called for Raman pens and silk of Chin,
<lb/>And bade a scribe approach. He first gave thanks
<lb/>To God almighty, the omniscient Guide,
<lb/><q>The Lord of knowledge and of Grace, the Lord
<lb/>Of diadem and kingship,</q> then wrote thus:—
<lb/><q>'T should by rights attach this man. He hath not
<lb/>Amassed these hoards by thievery and bloodshed,
<lb/>Hath not incited others to do wrong,
<lb/>But he hath been ungrateful and not had
<lb/>The fear of God within him, hath kept ward
<lb/>O’er all this treasure to the detriment,
<lb/>By such amassing, both of heart and soul.
<lb/>Wolf is as good as sheep upon yon plain
<lb/>Since neither yieldeth profit or return.
<lb/>A buried gem is nothing but a stone,
<lb/>Affording no one either food or raiment.
<lb/>We shall not found a treasury on his toils,
<lb/>Or fix our heart upon this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>Evanished from the world are Faridin,
<lb/>Iraj withal, Tar, and, amidst the mighty,
<pb n="74"/>
<lb/>Sam, Shah Kaus, and Kai Kubad, besides
<lb/>The other potentates whose names we cherish,
<lb/>And mine own sire who filled my heart with pain
<lb/>As being neither just nor generous.
<lb/>None of these great men is in evidence;
<lb/>Herein there is no striving with the Lord.
<lb/>Collect this treasure and distribute it,
<lb/>But touch not thou one hair. To every one
<lb/>That hideth his necessities and looketh
<lb/>Long vainly for remission from his ills;
<lb/>To old men past their work and despicable
<lb/>In rich men’s eyes; to those that have spent all,
<lb/>And now in trouble breathe forth chilling sighs;
<lb/>To those that have renown but not dinars;
<lb/>To traders reft of friends; to little ones
<lb/>Whom thou beholdest orphans, their sires dead,
<lb/>And they themselves in want of gold and silver;
<lb/>To women that have neither spouse nor raiment,
<lb/>That know no handicraft and no employment,
<lb/>Give all these treasures and irradiate
<lb/>The lives of those poor souls. This done, neglect not
<lb/>The hidden treasures, but bestow the hoards
<lb/>Of Farshidward upon the mendicants
<milestone unit="calced" n="1535"/>
<lb/>For their relief. Dinars and gems are dust
<lb/>To him since he must needs go bury them.
<lb/>May turning heaven be thy companion,
<lb/>All justice mayst thou be and self-restraint.</q>
<lb/>They set the Shah’s seal on the document,
<lb/>And thereupon the courier turned and went.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><head>How Bahram went to the Chase and slew Lions</head>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram bade slaves set up the imperial throne
<lb/>Within the pleasance, then in spring-tide beauty.
<pb n="75"/>
<lb/>They brought the turquoise throne at his command,
<lb/>And set it 'neath a blossom-shedding tree,
<lb/>They brought forth wine and cups, and minstrels went
<lb/>Toward the pleasance with the chiefs. The king
<lb/>Said to his counsellors: <q>This is the time
<lb/>Of jollity for men. We all must couch;
<lb/>Death treadeth under foot the rolls of fame,
<lb/>The hall and palace. We shall have enough
<lb/>Of our own company within the charnel,
<lb/>Men both of mien and stature though we be.
<lb/>The king and beggar carry when they die
<lb/>Naught but their good and ill away with them.
<lb/>What toil soe’er men bear is only loss,
<lb/>For, when they perish, that will perish too.
<lb/>That praise of us remaineth is enough,
<lb/>For crown and girdle are another’s share.
<lb/>Thou needest innocence and uprightness
<lb/>That thine enjoyments prove not scath to thee.
<lb/>My years exceed already eight and thirty,
<lb/>And many a day hath fleeted in delight,
<lb/>But, after two score years, grief for the day
<lb/>Of death is instant with us. If one hair
<lb/>Turn white upon our heads we must forgo
<lb/>All hope of joy; when musk becometh camphor
<lb/>‘Tis ruined; camphor suiteth not the crown.
<lb/>Two years more will I spend in feast and sport,
<lb/>Then, when my strength is somewhat broken, go
<lb/>Before God’s presence, don the woollen robe,
<lb/>And be not thankless for His mercies to me,
<lb/>For I have passed my days in joy and had
<lb/>My share of royal crown. Now for the rose,
<lb/>The apple, the pomegranate, and the quince!
<lb/>Let not the golden goblet fail of wine!


<note>1 The Emperor Babar (A.D. 1483-1530) in his diary made similar
good resolutions, which he did not keep: <quote>As I intend, when forty
years old, to abstain from wine ; and as I now want somewhat less than
one year of being forty, I drink wine most copiously.</quote> EHI, iv. 226.</note>
<pb n="76"/>


<lb/>But when I see the apples amber-cheeked,
<lb/>The heavens dappled like a leopard’s back,
<lb/>The fragrant camomile producing seed,
<lb/>And wine as ruddy as the reveller,
<lb/>When air is pleasant, neither hot nor cold,
<lb/>Earth fresh and water blue, what time we don
<lb/>Our autumn furs, I must to Jaz to hunt,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1536"/>
<lb/>And hold a hunting-bout upon that plain
<lb/>To make me a memorial in the world.
<lb/>Meanwhile the onager will grow plump-necked,
<lb/>And compass lion’s heart and tiger’s strength.
<lb/>We must take dogs and cheetahs, hawks and falcons,<note n="1">Two sorts of falcons are mentioned in the text—the charkh and
<lb/>the shéhin (falco sacer and falco peregrinator?).</note>
<lb/>For that far faring since it is the spot
<lb/>For onager and archery, and there
<lb/>No moment will we rest from chevying.
<lb/>The plain that I have set mine eyes upon
<lb/>Is lower Jaz. There tamarisks are tall
<lb/>As spear-shafts, there too we shall find the lion,
<lb/>And have a hunting if we bide our time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He waited till the clouds of Shahrivar
<lb/>Arose, then all the world was filled with troops.
<lb/>From every clime an army keen for strife
<lb/>Set face toward the monarch of Iran,
<lb/>Who chose among them chiefs of note as hunters,
<lb/>And carried with him to the chase a force
<lb/>Of thirty thousand mounted Scimitars.
<lb/>They took with them pavilions, tent-enclosures,
<lb/>Tents, beasts, and shielings, while the underlings
<lb/>Went on before Bahram Gar to dig wells,
<lb/>To furnish them withal with wheel and bucket,
<lb/>And run the water into troughs. The Shah
<lb/>Came later with his meiny to the chase.
<lb/>He saw the plain well stocked with onager,
<lb/>The woods alive with lions, and thus said:—

<pb n="77"/>

<lb/><q>Wine is our quarry to-night, for on the sand
<lb/>Are many lion-tracks, and we must have
<lb/>A lion-hunt to-morrow. Rest ye then
<lb/>In health of body and in merry pin,
<lb/>And let us drink till daybreak, till the sun—
<lb/>The lustre of the world—is bright again.
<lb/>Our scimitars shall fell the lions first,
<lb/>Shall fell those valiant dragons. When the woods
<lb/>Are cleared of lions then the onager
<lb/>Shall yield himself a servant to my shafts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He stayed that night and, when the morning dawned,
<lb/>Approached the forest with his men, whereat
<lb/>A lion, lusty-grown with battening
<lb/>On onagers, rushed forth, and brave Bahram
<lb/>Said to his friends: <q>Though I have bow and arrows,
<lb/>And mastery therewith, I will assail
<lb/>Yon lion with the scimitar that none
<lb/>May call me coward.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Donning a shrunk vest
<lb/>Of wool he mounted on his battle-steed.
<lb/>Now when that dragon of a lion saw him
<lb/>It reared, brought down its claws, and sought to strike
<lb/>The charger on the head.<note n="1">Blanford describes a lioness attacking his horse much in this way,
<lb/>and remarks that Persian sporting pictures generally represent the lion
<lb/>as leaping, not rearing. EP, ii. 32.</note> The warrior heeled
<lb/>His steed and with his trenchant scimitar,
<lb/>What while the lioness made off apace,

<milestone unit="calced" n="1537"/>
<lb/>Struck at the lion’s head and clave the beast
<lb/>Down to its middle, filling lions’ hearts
<lb/>With fear; yet gallantly another one
<lb/>Came roaring, one whose mate was suckling cubs.
<lb/>He smote that lion’s neck and parted head
<lb/>From trunk. One said to him: <q>O sun-faced Shah!
<lb/>Hast thou not any mercy on thyself?
<lb/>The wood is full of lions and their young—

<pb n="78"/>

<lb/>Cubs that are sucklings. Let the lions be,
<lb/>For in the autumn-time they breed. This forest
<lb/>Is three leagues deep, and if thou wert to spend
<lb/>A year in taking lions wouldst not clear it;
<lb/>So why impose such labour on thyself?
<lb/>The Shah, when first he sat upon the throne,
<lb/>Fought lions only as the compact was.<note n="1">See Vol. vi. p. 405 seq.</note>
<lb/>Now thou art Shah, the world is thine, so why
<lb/>Fight with them still? Thou came’st for onager.</q>
<lb/><q>Old sage,</q> the Shah said, <q>let to-morrow dawn,
<lb/>And heigh for onager and shaft and me!
<lb/>But cavaliers and nobles now alive
<lb/>Can rival me in archery, so when
<lb/>We give its due to manhood we must take
<lb/>Account of iron mace and scimitar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage said: <q>Hadst thou ten horsemen with thee,
<lb/>And like thee in the fight, then Rum and Chin
<lb/>Would have no crown and throne, and men of wisdom
<lb/>Would ship their goods off. Be the evil eye
<lb/>Far from thy Grace, and be it thine to feast
<lb/>Among the roses.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then with archimages,
<lb/>And captains of the host, the Shah departed
<lb/>Toward his tent-enclosure from the wood
<lb/>What while the troops acclaimed him, saying thus:—
<lb/><q>Ne’er may the crown and signet-ring lack thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That paladin then entered his pavilion,
<lb/>His escort quitting him, and washed his hands
<lb/>Of sweat. He had with him a trusty steward,
<lb/>Who draped a fresh tent for him. There they set
<lb/>Musk, camphor, and rose-water, and spread musk
<lb/>Withal upon the sleeping-place. Each tent
<lb/>Had golden tables laid with services
<lb/>Of ware of Chin where lamb and other meats

<pb n="79"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Were served by the chief server. Shah Bahram Gur,
<lb/>The eating done, called for a mighty cup
<lb/>Of crystal, which a fairy-faced cup-bearer
<lb/>Brought and consigned it to the just king’s hands,
<lb/>Who said: <q>Ardshir, the great king, he whose fortune
<lb/>Made old folk young, was founder of our house,
<lb/>And we are underlings if we be worthy
<lb/>E’en of that title. Both in fight and feast,
<lb/>At counsel and at board, give none but him
<lb/>The title of world’s lord. What time Sikandar
<milestone unit="calced" n="1538"/>
<lb/>Came to Iran from Rum and wrecked the land,
<lb/>Since he was both ungenerous and harsh,
<lb/>And slew kings six and thirty, monarchs’ lips
<lb/>Are full of curses, and earth’s surface full
<lb/>Of vengeance, on him. Faridan they praise,
<lb/>And he is cursed by stirrers up of strife.
<lb/>Throughout the world may only good proceed
<lb/>From me to small and great. Bring me a herald,</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He added, <q>one of goodly voice and leading,
<lb/>Let him go round the host and thus proclaim
<lb/>O’er way and waste alike: <q>Whoe’er shall lay
<lb/>Within the region of Barkth and Jaz
<lb/>Unlawful hands on aught, from jewels, gold,
<lb/>Dinars, and furs to mean and worthless chaff,
<lb/>Him will I horse face tail-wards and will have
<lb/>Two of the soldiery to lead him hence.
<lb/>His feet shall be made fast beneath his steed,
<lb/>And to the temple of Azargashasp
<lb/>Will I dispatch him there to supplicate
<lb/>All-holy God and worship in the dust
<lb/>Before the Fire. I will bestow his goods
<lb/>On those whom he hath robbed and wronged withal.
<lb/>If any horse shall injure growing crops,
<lb/>Or harm fruit-bearing trees, the horse’s owner,
<pb n="80"/>
<lb/>Be he a noble or of no account,
<lb/>Shall not escape a year’s imprisonment.
<lb/>My work is but to carry from the desert
<lb/>My portion, then go home again rejoicing.</q></q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The more part of the traffickers of Jaz,
<lb/>And of Barkth, went out upon the plain,
<lb/><lb/>And with their various packs produced a scene
About the host like a bazar in Chin.

<p>
<lb/>How Bahram went to hunt the Onager, showed his Skill before
<lb/>the Princes, and returned to Baghdad and Istakhr
<lb/>Whenas the sun next day displayed its crown
<lb/>The world-lord went to hunt the onager;
<lb/>The soldiers strung their bows, the Shah himself
<lb/>Rode in the rear. He said: <q>If one should take
<lb/>His bow to shoot at any beast the arrow
<lb/>Should strike the buttocks and come through the breast.</q>
<lb/>A paladin replied: <q>O king! consider
<lb/>Who in this noble host can shoot like that
<lb/>Among thy friends or foes unless indeed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1539"/>

<lb/>Thou shoot in person. May thy head and crown
<lb/>For ever live. When thou tak’st mace and arrow,
<lb/>And scimitar, thy warriors are awe-struck
<lb/>At thy commanding height and royal Grace,
<lb/>While other archers’ hands lose all their strength.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Tis of God. If He withdraw it,
<lb/>What strength hath then Bahram?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He urged Shabdiz,
<lb/>And, nearing a buck onager, let fly
<lb/>His arrow, when the moment came, and skewered
<lb/>Together chest and buttock. As it died
<pb n="81"/>
<lb/>The nobles of the golden belt came up;
<lb/>They marvelled at his shot, and all applauded,
<lb/>They could not see the arrow’s point and feathers,
<lb/>For they were hidden in the onager.
<lb/>The warlike cavaliers and soldiers bent
<lb/>With faces to the ground before Bahram,
<lb/>What while a paladin exclaimed: <q>O king!
<lb/>Ne’er may thine eye behold the ill of fortune.
<lb/>Thou art a horseman but all we ride asses,
<lb/>And are but ill at that!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah replied:—
<lb/><q>Not mine the arrow, for the All-conqueror
<lb/>Assisteth me. None in the world is viler
<lb/>Than one whose prop and helper God is not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He urged his charger onward, thou hadst said:—
<lb/><q>Yon courser is an eagle in its flight!</q>
<lb/>A gallant onager appeared. Forthwith
<lb/>The Lion reached out for his scimitar,
<lb/>And with a sword-stroke clave the beast asunder
<lb/>In equal halves. Chiefs, nobles, and attendants
<lb/>Armed with the scimitar, came up to him,
<lb/>And, when they saw that stroke, a sage exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>What swordsmanship and might are here! Oh! may
<lb/>The evil eye ne’er look upon this Shah.
<lb/>He hath no semblance save the moon in heaven,
<note n="1"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">il ne laissera peut-être pas la lune dans le ciel</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Beneath him are the heads of this world’s chiefs,
<lb/>While heaven is lower than his scimitar,
<lb/>And arrow-point.</q>
<lb/>The troops that followed him
<lb/>Cleared all the plain of onager. He bade
<lb/>Make rings of gold and grave his name thereon.
<lb/>He ringed the creatures’ ears and let them go;
<lb/>Six hundred too he branded in a batch,
<lb/>Then freed them for the honour of his name,
<lb/>And for his will and pleasure, while a man
<pb n="82"/>
<lb/>Went round the host proclaiming thus: <q>Let none
<lb/>Sell to the merchants any onagers
<lb/>On this broad plain but give them as a gift.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They brought him from Barkah and from the chiefs
<lb/>Of Jaz abundance of brocade and furs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1540"/>
<lb/>These he accepted and then bade remit
<lb/>Those countries’ tax and toll though both could pay.
<lb/>Their poor and those that earned their bread grew rich
<lb/>By reason of his bounty. Many too
<lb/>Had thrones and crowns. He went home from the chase,
<lb/>And passed a week in mirth among his men.
<lb/>It was his wont to hold an open court
<lb/>Upon the riding-ground, and thither used
<lb/>To fare the troops, the men of eloquence,
<lb/>The wise, the needy, and the suppliants.
<lb/><q>O ye that seek your rights!</q> he used to say,
<lb/><q>Take shelter from your enemies with God,
<lb/>While ye that have not slept through toil for me,
<lb/>And yet have had no portion of my wealth,
<lb/>Come to the king upon the riding-ground,
<lb/>And haply he will make your fortunes new.
<lb/>If any one is old, past work, and weak,
<lb/>Or, being young, is crippled by disease;
<lb/>If any of the people be in debt,
<lb/>And worried by the stress of creditors;
<lb/>If any children are left fatherless,
<lb/>And yet ask not of those possessed of wealth;
<lb/>Or if the children’s mothers are in want
<lb/>In secret and conceal their poverty;
<lb/>Or if, again, a wealthy man hath died,
<lb/>And left behind young children in this land,
<lb/>Whom an executor, devoid of fear
<lb/>And reverence for God, is plundering,
<lb/>Keep nothing of this kind concealed from me;
<lb/>I want not people that conceal their wants.
<pb n="83"/>
<lb/>I will enrich the poor, I will restore
<lb/>The souls of misbelievers to the Faith;
<lb/>I will defray the debts of those who have
<lb/>No money and whose hearts are sad, and open
<lb/>My treasury’s door to modest indigence.
<lb/>If wrong befall from officers of mine
<lb/>Defrauding children that have lost their sires,
<lb/>Those doers of injustice will I gibbet
<lb/>Alive for wronging one of noble race.</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>The Shah, advanced in wisdom and glad-hearted,
<lb/>Went from the hunting-field toward Baghdad,<note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 254.</note>
<lb/>And to his presence came the haughty chiefs,
<lb/>Both alien and those akin to him.
<lb/>He bade his retinue disperse and sought
<lb/>His own delightsome palace. They adorned
<lb/>The bower of Barzin, the handmaids there
<lb/>Were clamorous for musk and wine, the Idols
<lb/>Got ready song and harp, the hall was cleared
<lb/>Of strangers. What with harp and wine and pipe,
<lb/>And sound of song, the vaulted heaven seemed
<lb/>To greet the air. All night from every chamber
<lb/>They brought forth bands of dancers that the Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1541"/>
<lb/>Might be not sad of heart. He spent two weeks
<lb/>In mirth, and oped his treasury day and night,
<lb/>Gave largess, and departed for Istakhr,
<lb/>Placed on his head the glorious, royal crown,
<lb/>Unlocked the bower of Kharrad, and furnished
<lb/>The Idols there with treasure and with drachms.
<lb/>If any in that golden women’s house
<lb/>Had not a crown aloft an ivory throne
<lb/>The monarch of Iran growled mightily,
<lb/>Bit at Razbih his lip in indignation,
<lb/>And said: <q>The tribute from Khazar and Ram
<lb/>I give, when paid, to these, but for the nonce
<lb/>Now requisition ass-loads of dinars,
<pb n="84"/>
<lb/>And treasure-loads from Ispahan and Rai.
<lb/>A women’s house when in such case as this
<lb/>Will grow all desolate and not befit
<lb/>The fortunes of the monarch of Iran.</q>
<lb/>They spread brocade upon the floor, and caused
<lb/>Fresh tribute to be paid in every land.
<lb/>The world thus passed awhile an easy life—
<lb/>No war, no toil, no conflict, and no strife.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><head>How the Khan of Chin led forth a Host to war with Bahram, and how the Iranians asked Quarter of the Khan and submitted to him</head>
<p>

<lb/>Anon news came to Hind, Rum, Turkistan,
<lb/>Chin, and all parts inhabited: <q>The heart
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram is given up to sport,
<lb/>He taketh no account of any one,
<lb/>He hath no outposts, no men are on guard,
<lb/>And on the marches are no paladins.
<lb/>For love of sport he suffereth all to drift,
<lb/>And knoweth nothing of the world’s affairs.</q>
<lb/>Now when the Khan of Chin heard this he levied
<lb/>Troops from Khutan and Chin, paid them, and set
<lb/>His face toward Iran. No one took thought
<lb/>About Bahram while Caesar for his part
<lb/>Marched forth in force from Rum. When tidings reached
<lb/>Iran from Rum and Hind, from Chin and all
<lb/>The settled regions: <q>Caesar hath assembled
<lb/>And led an army forth while troops are seen
<lb/>Advancing from Khutan and Chin,</q> the chieftains,
<lb/>The warriors old and young within Iran,
<lb/>All came before Bahram Gur, full of wrath,
<lb/>Of rage, and bitterness, and bluntly said:—
<pb n="85"/>
<lb/><q>Thy glorious fortune hath displayed its back.
<lb/>The heads of kings should be intent on fighting,
<lb/>But thy heart is intent on sport and feasting;
<lb/>The crown and throne are worthless in thine eyes,
<lb/>So are Iran, the treasure, and the host.</q></p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1542"/>    


<p>
<lb/>The Shah, the ruler of the world, thus answered
<lb/>Those archimages, his admonishers:—
<lb/><q>My helper is the Master of the world,
<lb/>One who is wiser than the wisest sages.
<lb/>I by the conquering virtue of great kings
<lb/>Will guard Iran against the claws of Wolves;
<lb/>By fortune, host, wealth, scimitar will I
<lb/>Avert this pain and travail from the realm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He toyed on just the same, his nobles’ eyes
<lb/>Were full of blood through him, and all folk said:—
<lb/><q>This Shah will alienate all good men’s hearts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Yet Shah Bahram’s heart was awake and full
<lb/>Of trouble at the tidings. Secretly
<lb/>He organised the host while folk at large
<lb/>Knew not his privy purpose. All Iran
<lb/>Was in dismay at what they saw of him;
<lb/>Their hearts were riven by anxiety;
<lb/>They all were in despair about the king,
<lb/>And held his rule and person in contempt.
<lb/>Now when the Khan was drawing nigh Iran,
<lb/>News of him reached the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>Who called to him the aspiring Gustaham,
<lb/>And spake much of the Khan and of his host.
<lb/>This Gustaham was paladin in chief,
<lb/>And minister, and fight came as a feast
<lb/>To him. The Shah called Mihr Piruz withal,
<lb/>Son of Bihzad, he called too Mahyar Barzin,
<lb/>Son of Kharrad, Bahram, son of Piruz,
<lb/>Son of Bahram, Ruhham and Kharzarwan,
<lb/>Which twain were of Sasanian lineage,
<lb/>One king of Rai, and of Gilan the other,
<pb n="86"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Who stood up stoutly on the day of battle,
<lb/>With Rad, son of Barzin, approved in fight,
<lb/>Who was the ruler of Zabulistan,
<lb/>Karan too and Burzin and Dara the grim,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, while of the Iranians
<lb/>He chose him out a hundred thousand men,
<lb/>Men of discretion, well beseen in war,
<lb/>Committing to a scion of the race
<lb/>In power—Narsi, the brother of the Shah
<lb/>So pure of Faith—those cavaliers and throne
<lb/>And crown that he might guard the treasury
<lb/>And realm. Narsi, that man of noble mien,
<lb/>Possessed of Grace and Faith and loving looks,
<lb/>Took up the charge, and thereupon the Shah
<lb/>Chose from the host twelve thousand cavaliers
<lb/>Fit for the day of battle—veterans
<lb/>With ox-head maces and in coats of mail—
<lb/>And marched thence to Azarabadagan;
<lb/>But, as he took from Pars so small a host,
<lb/>The mighty and the common folk alike
<lb/>Thought: <q>Shah Bahram is fleeing from the fight,
<lb/>And making off toward Azargashasp.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>What time Bahram set face toward the Fire
<lb/>From Caesar came an envoy swift as wind.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1543"/>
<lb/>Narsi received and lodged him fittingly
<lb/>Within the palace.
<lb/>Now the host approached
<lb/>The high priest to get knowledge of Bahram,
<lb/>And said: <q>Why scattereth he his treasures thus
<lb/>Instead of heaping them like other Shahs?
<lb/>He squandereth gold everywhere because
<lb/>He knoweth not its worth. Both citizens
<lb/>And soldiers are dispersed, and all have sought
<lb/>Some course of betterment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>At length, when words
<lb/>Had waxen old, all folk agreed to send
<pb n="87"/>
<lb/>A man of reputation to the Khan
<lb/>Of Chin, <q>Because,</q>said they, <q>ere evils come
<lb/>With war and pillage we must try all means
<lb/>To save Iran: the master of the house
<lb/>Is lost.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Narsi replied: <q>This is not well;
<lb/>The world hath not a bed for such a stream.
<lb/>Shall I ask quarter of the king of Chin?
<lb/>I will clothe earth with men and elephants.
<lb/>There are arms, treasure, and courageous men,
<lb/>Whose swords would send dust out of fire itself.
<lb/>Why this despair concerning Shah Bahram
<lb/>Because he started with a little band?
<lb/>Why have your thoughts turned evil thus? If ye
<lb/>Think ill then ill will come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Iranians heard,
<lb/>And answered him perversely, saying: <q>Bahram,
<lb/>Departing hence, took not a host with him,
<lb/>And must we not resign our hearts to grief,
<lb/>For when the Khan shall come to fight Iran
<lb/>Our land will lose both scent and hue? The foe
<lb/>Will trample on us shamefully, Narsi
<lb/>And all the host will be o’erthrown. All means
<lb/>Will we endeavour to maintain our place
<lb/>And standing here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>There was an archimage,
<lb/>A skilful, learned, single-hearted man,
<lb/>Humai by name, and him the Iranians chose
<lb/>To gird his loins and undertake their cause,
<lb/>Then wrote the Khan upon their own behalf
<lb/>A cringing letter which began: <q>Thy slaves
<lb/>Are we and bow down to thy will and pleasure.
<lb/>We send thee of the produce of Iran
<lb/>Together with our homage and excuses,
<lb/>With gifts too, toll and tribute, for we have
<lb/>No power to stand against the king in war.</q>
<pb n="88"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So from Iran the blest Humai arrived
<lb/>With certain nobles—men of honest counsels—
<lb/>And gave the Khan the message of the chiefs,
<lb/>Whereat his heart rejoiced. Humai withal
<lb/>Spake of the swift remove of Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And of his hasty flight without a host,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1544"/>
<lb/>Before the noble Khan whose heart and soul
<lb/>Expanded like a rose. He told the Turkmans: <q>Now we have saddled the revolving sky!
<lb/>Who ever took Iran without a fight
<lb/>As we have by our counsel, wit, and patience?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave great presents to the messenger,
<lb/>Drachms and no few dinars, and wrote this answer: <q>May wisdom company the pure of soul.
<lb/>I do agree to what hath been proposed
<lb/>By this ambassador of honest men.
<lb/>When with my host I reach Marv I will make
<lb/>The clime like pheasant's plumes,</q><note>Because <foreign>tadarv</foreign>, <gloss>pheasant</gloss>, rhymes with <foreign>Marv</foreign>.</note> <q>and streams run
<lb/>milk</q><note>Reading with P. and T.</note><q>By justice, prudence, and magnificence.
<lb/>I will await the tribute from Iran—
<lb/>The Lions' gifts and taxes. I shall come
<lb/>To Marv, or rather I shall pass it by,
<lb/>Not wishing to cause damage by my troops.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The messenger returned in haste and told
<lb/>His converse with the Khan who led his host
<lb/>To Marv, the world was black with horsemen's dust.
<lb/>When he had rested he concerned himself
<lb/>With feasting; no one thought about Bahram.
<lb/>At Marv there was no rest or sleep for sound
<lb/>Of harp and lyre, the troops were all abroad.
<lb/>There was no watch, no prospect of a shock,
<lb/>But all was sport, wine, parties, twang of lyre,
<lb/>And feeling night and day secure from war.
<pb n="89"/>
<lb/>The Khan was looking for the Iranians' tribute.
<lb/>Wroth that it came so late. Bahram for his part
<lb/>Slept not but guarded well his host from foes,
<lb/>Kept his spies busy both by night and day,
<lb/>And threw in feast and wine no time away.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><head>How Bahram attacked the Host of the Khan and took him</head>

<p>
<lb/>As soon as tidings came to Shah Bahram:
<lb/><q>The Khan and his great host are all at Marv,</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He led his soldiers from Azargashasp,
<lb/>Each with two horses but no baggage-train.
<lb/>With Ruman helmet, morion, and cuirass
<lb/>He hurried on like wind by day and night,
<lb/>His soldiers rushing like a mountain-stream,
<lb/>And reached Amul by way of Ardabil.
<lb/>Departing thence he marched on to Gurgan,
<lb/>Enduring all the chieftains’ toil and pain,
<lb/>And thence came to the city of Nisa;
<lb/>One from Bisa preceded him as guide.
<lb/>O’er mount and waterless and wayless tracts,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1545"/>
<lb/>At times unwonted, through the night till morn,
<lb/>He marched and had the watch out night and day.
<lb/>Thus swifter than a pheasant<note>See p. 88, note.</note> in its flight
<lb/>He drew toward Marv. A runner from his scouts
<lb/>Arrived and told: <q>The Khan attendeth not
<lb/>To state-affairs but followeth the chase
<lb/>At Kashmihan with wicked Ahriman
<lb/>As minister.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram rejoiced to hear it;
<lb/>His travail seemed but wind. There for a day
<lb/>He rested and, when steed and Shah and troops

<pb n="90"/>

<lb/>Were all refreshed, reached Kashmihan. At dawn,
<lb/>What time the Lustre of the world arose
<lb/>Above the hills, all ears were filled with blast
<lb/>Of trumpet and all eyes with glint of flag-tops,
<lb/>The din of battle went up from the chase,
<lb/>And filled the ears of Shah and troops. The clamour
<lb/>Split mighty lions’ ears. Thou wouldst have said:
<lb/><q>The clouds are hailing,</q> wouldst have said: <q>The moon
<lb/>Is raining blood,</q> so sanguine was the dust
<lb/>Upon that battlefield! The Khan, aroused
<lb/>And dazed, was ta’en by Khazarwén. Withal
<lb/>Three hundred of the noblemen of Chin
<lb/>Were captured and fast bound on saddle-back.
<lb/>The Shah advanced on Marv from Kashmihan,
<lb/>Thin as a reed with riding for so long.
<lb/>The few of Chin that yet remained at Marv
<lb/>They slew. He followed up the fugitives
<lb/>For thirty leagues; behind him was Karan
<lb/>Of Pars. Returning to the hunting-ground
<lb/>He gave the booty to the troops. When thus
<lb/>He raised his head in triumph over Chin
<lb/>He recognised in all the power of God,
<lb/>Who to his other good had given the boon
<lb/>Of might, and is the Lord of sun and moon.

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur stayed to rest at Marv and when
<lb/>Both Shah and war-steed were refreshed he chose
<lb/>Bukhara for the next attack, for he
<pb n="91"/>
<lb/>Had changed from gentleness to bitterness.
<lb/>He reached Amwi<note>Probably the modern Charjui.</note> in one day and one night,
<lb/>Intent on conquest not on chase and sport.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1546"/>
<lb/>He reached it in the night’s first watch and crossed
<lb/>The river<note>The Oxus.</note> and the desert of Farab.
<lb/>Whenas the air was golden with the sun,
<lb/>And doffed its skirt of lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>The world was like a falcon’s wing with dust
<lb/>What time the world-lord passed by Mai and Margh.
<lb/>He smote the Turkman host and set on fire
<lb/>Their fields and fells, the stars concealed themselves
<lb/>Behind the moon’s skirts while the fathers made
<lb/>Their way across the bodies of their sons.
<lb/>All of the Turkmans that were leading men,
<lb/>Both veteran and youthful swordsmen, came
<lb/>Afoot in evil case before Bahram,
<lb/>With full hearts abjectly, and said: <q>O Shah!
<lb/>O mighty one! O favourite of the stars!
<lb/>O chief of all the nobles of the world!
<lb/>Since now the Khan is captive that broke faith
<lb/>Shed not the blood of those that did no wrong,
<lb/>For tyranny becometh not the great.
<lb/>If thou demandest tribute it is well,
<lb/>But why behead the guiltless? All of us,
<lb/>Both men and women, are thy slaves and are
<lb/>Thy vanquished in the fight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah’s heart burned
<lb/>For them. He sewed up with the hand of wisdom
<lb/>The eye of his displeasure. In concern
<lb/>That man of God restrained his warriors’ hands
<lb/>From shedding blood. His favour thus secured,
<lb/>The man of wrath appeased, the leading chiefs
<lb/>Agreed to pay a heavy tribute yearly.
<lb/>The Shah was well content; he took the tribute,
<lb/>And further sums in lieu of pillaging.

<pb n="92"/>
<lb/>He turned and reached the city of Farab,
<lb/>His cheeks were flushed and smiles were on his lips.
<lb/>He paused, allowed his troops to rest a week,
<lb/>And called to him the potentates of Chin.
<lb/>He reared a column of cement and stone,
<lb/>Which none, save by the Shah’s command, might pass
<lb/>Out of Iran, Khalaj, and Turkistan.
<lb/>He made the line between them the Jihun.
<lb/>There was among the troops one Shahra hight,
<lb/>A man of wisdom, rank, success, and fame.
<lb/>Bahram made him the ruler of Turan,
<lb/>And made his throne the crown upon the moon.
<lb/>When Shahra sat upon the silver throne
<lb/>He girt his loins and opened wide his hands,
<lb/>Set too the golden crown upon his head,
<lb/>And through the land joy universal spread.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><head>How Bahram wrote to announce his Victory to his Brother Narsi and returned to Iran</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1547"/>
<lb/>The business of Turan achieved, and when
<lb/>The Shah’s heart was released from care, he bade
<lb/>A scribe attend him, called for pen and ink
<lb/>And silk of Chin, and wrote Narsi a letter
<lb/>About the Turkman war and what his troops
<lb/>Had done. It thus began: <q>The nobles praise
<lb/>Through me—a slave—the Maker of the world—
<lb/>The Lord of victory and mastery,
<lb/>The Lord of Saturn, Mars, and Moon, the Lord
<lb/>Of lofty, circling heaven, the Lord of mean
<lb/>And miserable dust. The great and lowly
<lb/>Are underneath His governance, and all
<lb/>That is to be is subject to His word.
<pb n="93"/>
<lb/>I have indited from the coasts of Chin
<lb/>A letter to my brother in Iran,
<lb/>And this same letter, writ on painted silk,
<lb/>Is meant too for our chiefs and folk at large.
<lb/>Those that were not engaged against the Khan
<lb/>Must hear the tale from us who fought with him.
<lb/>His army was so vast that thou hadst said:
<lb/><q>The dust thereof hath smeared the sky with pitch!</q>
<lb/>The coasts became as ’twere a sea of blood,
<lb/>The unjust’s fortune drooped, and he was taken
<lb/>Because<note>Reading with P.</note> the turning sky was weary of him.
<lb/>Now have I brought him on a camel bound,
<lb/>With wounded liver and with blood-filled eyes.
<lb/>The necks of all the proud are bent, their tongues
<lb/>Are gentle, and their hearts are hot within them.
<lb/>Those now pay tribute who were enemies,
<lb/>And they that erred have come back to the way.
<lb/>I and my host, as my well-wishers would,
<lb/>Will follow this dispatch.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The wind-foot camels,
<lb/>Foam-scattering, parted like a thunder-clap,
<lb/>And when the letter reached Narsi the heart
<lb/>Of that prince throbbed with joy. The high priest came
<lb/>With all the heroes of the royal race
<lb/>Before Narsi, the palace rang with joy,
<lb/>And all gave ear to that report. The nobles
<lb/>Were pricked at heart for shame before the Shah
<lb/>By reason of their fault. Among the chiefs
<lb/>Six score and ten and more went to Narsi
<lb/>To proffer their excuses, saying thus:
<lb/><q>Perverse suggestions and the Div’s behest
<lb/>Have led us to transgress the World-lord’s way.
<lb/>To such a host as that one would presume
<lb/>That God would ope Heaven’s gate. ’Tis marvellous,
<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1548"/>
<lb/>Surpassing thought and all the providence
<lb/>Of wise and learnéd men! In thy reply,
<lb/>'Mongst matters fair and foul, vouchsafe to give
<lb/>A place to our excuse. Although the chiefs
<lb/>Have erred the illustrious Shah may pardon them.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Narsi agreed and said: <q>So will I do
<lb/>As to release the Shah’s heart from revenge.</q>
<lb/>He wrote at once an answer to the letter,
<lb/>Disclosing matters fair and foul, and said:
<lb/><q>The Iranians in their pain and misery,
<lb/>And for the sake of country, children, treasure,
<lb/>Went for protection to the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Despairing of their own illustrious Shah;
<lb/>Twas not through enmity, offence, or strife;
<lb/>No other Shah had gained their preference.
<lb/>Now if the conqueror, the king of kings,
<lb/>Will pardon he will make their dark night day.
<lb/>Me they selected as the advocate
<lb/>To urge their cause, and bade me: <q>Plead for us.</q></q>
<lb/>An archimage, by name Burzmihr, agreed
<lb/>To go upon that embassage, approached
<lb/>The monarch of the world, and told him all.
<lb/>The Shah was well contented by the words,
<lb/>The fire of his fierce anger ceased to fume.
<lb/>Then from Chaghan, Khatlan, Balkh, and Bukhara
<lb/>The chieftains went with tribute, and the archmages
<lb/>From the Gharchis with sacred twigs, and pleaded
<lb/>Before the worshippers of Fire, and thus
<lb/>From year to year all those that had the means
<lb/>Went to the court with taxes and with tribute.
<lb/>When the Fire-fane was ready and the place
<lb/>To hold the feasts of New Year and of Sada
<lb/>The Shah approached Azar Abadagan,
<lb/>He and his nobles and his men of name;
<lb/>They went to make their prayers before the Fire,
<lb/>And all the archmages offered reverence.

<lb/>The Shah gave largess to the worshippers,
<lb/>And passing thence proceeded to Istakhr,
<lb/>Which was the glory of the king of kings.
<lb/>From ox-hides and from sheep-skins, borne before him
<lb/>Upon the backs of elephants, were scattered
<lb/>A thousand quintals and eight score of largess;
<lb/>Part was in drachms, the rest in gold dinars—
<lb/>Coin that an archimage of Pars would call
<lb/>In ancient Persian <foreign>paidawasis.</foreign><note>The <foreign>paidawasi</foreign> was a silver coin=to five dinars.</note> Then
<lb/>He brought his scented leather bags of coin,
<lb/>And lavished gold and silver. If he saw
<lb/>Upon a journey any broken bridge,
<lb/>Or heard of any hostelry in ruins
<lb/>From his officials, he would give command
<lb/>For their repair out of his treasury
<lb/>Without forced labour. On the poor withal,
<lb/>And those that toiled to earn their daily bread,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1549"/>
<lb/>He lavished drachms, for bounty never irked him,
<lb/>While, thirdly, on the honest folk, the widows,
<lb/>And infant orphans, he showered silver.
<lb/>Fourthly, on those too old for work or warfare,
<lb/>And, fifthly, on all those of noble birth
<lb/>That were despised by wealthy folk, and sixthly
<lb/>On folk that coming from a lengthy journey
<lb/>Paraded not their poverty, he lavished
<lb/>A treasure, and looked round him to do good.
<lb/>All booty he made over to his troops,
<lb/>And had no notion of amassing wealth.
<lb/>He bade a pious archimage to bring him
<lb/>The crown worn by the Khan of Chin. They took
<lb/>The jewels out and used them and the gold
<lb/>To grace a Fire-fane’s walls and decorate
<lb/>The throne-top of Azar. Thence he departed
<lb/>To Taisafan where dwelt Narsi with those
<lb/>Archmages that advised him. All the chiefs,
<pb n="95"/>
<lb/>The great men of Iran, and governors,
<lb/>Came forth to meet the Shah, and when Narsi
<lb/>Beheld that royal head and crown, the flags
<lb/>Resplendent, and that mighty host, he lighted,
<lb/>With all the great men and august archmages,
<lb/>And did obeisance to Bahram who bade him
<lb/>To mount again, and grasped him by the hand,
<lb/>Then went up to the golden throne and sat
<lb/>What while the chiefs stood girded in his presence.
<lb/>He lavished treasure on the indigent,
<lb/>They opened wide the prison’s narrow doors,
<lb/>The age was filled with jollity and justice,
<lb/>The hearts of all were strangers to distress.
<lb/>He banished toil and grief from every clime,
<lb/>He made a banquet for the great, and all
<lb/>That hasted to attend the royal board
<lb/>Received a present worthy of a lord.

<p>
<lb/>The third day at a feast made for the nobles
<lb/>A scribe was brought and set before the Shah,
<lb/>Who, when his visage was relaxed with wine,
<lb/>Wrote, joying in his lovingkindliness,
<lb/>A letter which began with praise of one
<lb/>That hath with knowledge laved his soul, made wisdom
<lb/>The jewel of his heart, won opulence
<lb/>By his own toil and hardihood, acknowledged
<lb/>That all good is from God, hath sought for wisdom,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1550"/>
<lb/>Made friends of sages, knoweth that from justice
<lb/>Naught will proceed but good, and knocketh not
<lb/>Upon the portal of malignity:—
<pb n="97"/>
<lb/><q>If one complaineth of mine officers,
<lb/>My noble chieftains or my men of war,
<lb/>They have no prospect but the cell or gibbet,
<lb/>And, if slain, vile committal to the dust.
<lb/>Endeavour to make others’ travail small,
<lb/>Give joy and happiness to mourners’ hearts,
<lb/>Because the world hath stayed, will stay, with none;
<lb/>Be just and inoffensive, that sufficeth.
<lb/>I am exemplary of what I say,
<lb/>And an incentive to all righteousness,
<lb/>For what a multitude of troops assailed
<lb/>Me and this noble company, while I
<lb/>Departed with a little host, and those
<lb/>Who were mine enemies are now my friends!
<lb/>One noble personage—the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>A world-lord having signet, crown, and throne—
<lb/>I captured, and the Turkmans’ fortunes fell.
<lb/>All-holy God made me victorious,
<lb/>My foemen’s heads have come to dust. Be service
<lb/>My sole employ, mine every thought be right.
<lb/>I will impose no tax for seven years
<lb/>On subject or compeer. I write this letter
<lb/>In our old tongue to chiefs and to officials
<lb/>That they may treat my subjects in accord
<lb/>To righteous precedent and take no thought
<lb/>Of doing wrong. Dispatch to me the names
<lb/>Of those that are in want within your towns,
<lb/>And in their portion have no day of joy,
<lb/>And well will I content them. Furthermore,
<lb/>If there be any men of noble birth,
<lb/>Who can recall to memory better days,
<lb/>Them also with my treasures set past need,
<lb/>And magnify the wise. The folk in debt,
<lb/>And empty-handed, who are everywhere
<lb/>Looked down upon and scorned, them too relieve
<lb/>Of debt and write their names upon the roll.

<lb/>Pray ye to God to keep our heart thus true
<lb/>To custom and the Faith, joy in this precept,
<lb/>And well entreat the underlings. Moreover,
<lb/>Despise not your own slaves, for they, like you,
<lb/>Are God’s. Let one of wealth, and fit therefor,
<lb/>Entrust to learnéd men his children. Make
<lb/>Their spirits rich in knowledge and encrown
<lb/>Their heads with wisdom. Keep your hands afar
<lb/>From others’ wealth, be ye without offence,

<lb/>Break not our fealty, and eradicate
<lb/>The stumps, the suckers, and the roots of evil.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1551"/>
<lb/>Seek not to do your neighbours injury,
<lb/>Especially the magnates and the rich;
<lb/>Make God your refuge, keep His ordinance,
<lb/>And your souls pledges of your love for Him.
<lb/>Whoever hath grown great from nothingness,
<lb/>And raised himself to independency,
<lb/>Call him not great, such greatness dwindleth soon.
<lb/>Be just, be worshippers of God, and wash
<lb/>Perverseness and injustice from your hands.
<lb/>All ye that have! withhold not from the poor;

<p>
<lb/>When they had written thus on lustrous silk
<lb/>The scribe dipped into musk his pen and wrote
<lb/>The heading thus: <q>The monarch of the world,
<lb/>The heart of justice, knowing good and ill,
<lb/>The lord of pardon, Grace, and puissance,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, the all-bounteous king of kings,
<lb/>To his marchlords and those beneath his rule—

<pb n="99"/>
<lb/>Then runners, cavaliers, and cameleers
<lb/>Went with the letter everywhere with guides,
<lb/>And when it came to all the provinces,

<p>
<lb/>Thereat the women, men, and children went
<lb/>In all lands from their houses to the plain,
<lb/>And all invoked a blessing silently
<lb/>Upon that upright monarch of the world,
<lb/>Then set themselves to feast and called for wine,
<lb/>And harp and minstrelsy. They feasted half
<lb/>The day, the other half they toiled.
<lb/>At springtide
<lb/>It was proclaimed before the court at dawn :
<lb/><q>Let those of substance eat and give away.
<lb/>Let them thank us for that which they enjoy,
<lb/>And let the poor come to the treasury,
<lb/>And carry thence five drachms of proper weight,
<lb/>Together with three mans<note>Cf. Vol. i. p. 290 note.</note> of bright, old wine
<lb/>Hued like pomegranate-blossom or like gold.</q>

<lb/>The world disposed itself to merriment,
<lb/>The shouts of revellers filled town and hamlet
<lb/>Until they bought a coronal of roses
<lb/>For two dinars and gave without complaint
<lb/>A drachm for a narcissus-spike. The old

<lb/>The Shah thanked God on seeing all the world
<lb/>Thus glad.
<lb/>One day he thus addressed Narsi :
<lb/><q>Depart hence with the signet and the crown.
<lb/>I have bestowed upon thee Khurasan;

<lb/>He bade prepare

<lb/>An opulent treasury, and said to him :
<lb/><q>God shelter thee, and be the sun’s throne thine.</q>
<lb/>The journey took two se’nnights, then Narsi
<lb/>Assumed in peace the rule of Khurasan.
<lb/>When he had gone one week the Shah, whose heart
<lb/>Was freed from care, bade, and the high priest went
<lb/>Before him, bringing certain of the nobles.
<lb/>The Shah addressed him, saying: <q>Ceasar’s business
<lb/>Is dragging on, and his ambassador
<lb/>Is waiting long for his dismission.
<lb/>What sort of man is he, and from the standpoint
<lb/>Of wisdom where is he, for wisdom straighteneth
<lb/>The soul?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The high priest answered: <q>Blest be thou,
<lb/>Lord of the world, and dowered with Grace divine.
<lb/>He is advanced in years, discreet, and modest,
<lb/>A man of goodly speech and gentle voice,
<lb/>A pupil of the school of Falatun,<note>Plato.</note>
<lb/>A man of wisdom, learned, and nobly born.
<lb/>He left Rum, full of energy, but now,

<lb/>With weak frame and with cheeks of reed-like hue.
<lb/>His servitors are all like sheep before

<lb/>Is of imperial race, is great, is sprung
<lb/>From Salm whose head was crowned by Faridan,
<lb/>And can recount his lineage sire by sire.
<lb/>He acteth in a manly, prudent way,
<lb/>And hath not turned to madness like the Khan.
<lb/>At audience we will call the envoy in,
<lb/>To see if what he saith be to the point,
<lb/>And then I will dismiss him graciously,
<lb/>For men are useful to me in this world;
<lb/>One is for war and bringeth troops, another
<lb/>For feasting and doth bring a golden crown.
<lb/>I must maintain the honour of Iran,
<lb/>The man that treateth with great men is great.</q>

<p>
<lb/>The high priest praised him lovingly and said:-

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><head>How Bahram called before him the Envoy of Caesar, and how
the Envoy questioned and answered the Archmages</head>
<p>
<lb/>The next day when the sun displayed its crown,
<lb/>And rays proceeded from the vaulted sky,
<lb/>The monarch of the world sat on his throne,
<lb/>And called the envoy in before his lords.
<lb/>That old man sage, experienced, eloquent,
<lb/>Of understanding and retentive mind,
<lb/>Approaching with dejected head and arms
<lb/>Enfolded, kneeled before the monarch’s throne.
<lb/>Bahram both greeted and made much of him,
<lb/>Set him upon the turquoise throne and said :—
<lb/><q>Here thou hast sojourned long; art thou not weary
<lb/>Of looking on this land? War with the Khan,
<pb n="102"/>
<lb/>Which closely partnered me, withheld me from thee;
<lb/>Now all our case is altered, and thy sojourn
<lb/>Exceedeth bounds. To that which thou shalt say
<lb/>We will reply, deriving from thy words
<lb/>Good rede.</q>
<lb/>The ancient envoy praised him, saying :—
<lb/><q>May time and earth ne’er lose thee. Every king
<lb/>Possessed of wisdom joyeth in the words
<lb/>Of sages; sages are more nigh to God;
<lb/>Those that think evil have the darker day.
<lb/>Midst this world’s chieftains thou art chief, who art
<lb/>At once Shah, chief, and best. Thy tongue’s a balance,
<lb/>Thy words are jewels, and who e’er will see
<lb/>Gems weighed ’gainst gold? Thou art possessed of knowledge,
<lb/>Of counsel, sense, and Grace, and all the methods
<lb/>Of conquering kings; thou art possessed of wisdom
<lb/>And holy rede, and master of the wise.
<lb/>Though Caesar’s envoy I am thy slave’s slave.
<lb/>I carry Caesar’s greeting to the Shah :—
<lb/><q>May this head, throne, and crown forever be.</q>
<lb/>And furthermore I have it in command
<lb/>To ask seven questions of thy men of lore.</q></p>

<p>The Shah replied : <q>Proceed; the highest honours
<lb/>Await the eloquent.</q> 
<lb/>He bade the high priest
<lb/>Come to his presence with the famous sages,
<lb/>But sighs were on his lips the while in view
<lb/>Of what the man might ask. <q>What are,</q> he thought, 
<milestone unit="calced" n="1554"/>
<lb/><q>The seven mysterious things whereof this Roman
<lb/>Would question us?</q>
<lb/>The high priest with the learned,
<lb/>Men mighty in all lore, came, and the spokesman
<lb/>Revealed the secret, telling to the high priest
<lb/>The words of Caesar: <q>What is <q>the within</q>
<lb/>In thy nomenclature, what <q>the without,</q>
<pb n="103"/>
<lb/>O guide, who hast no other name therefor?
<lb/>What is <q>the above,</q> my lord, what <q>the beneath</q>?
<lb/>What is <q>the infinite</q> and what <q>the vile</q>?
<lb/>What hath most names and ruleth everywhere?</q>
<lb/><q>Haste not,</q> the high priest answered thus the sage,
<lb/><q>And turn not from the path of understanding.</q></p>

<p>He then proceeded : <q>O thou man of wisdom!
<lb/>Give ear to each reply that I shall make:
<lb/>There is one answer only to thy words.
<lb/>As to thy question touching <q>the without,</q>
<lb/>And <q>the within,</q> it is an easy one:
<lb/>The heaven is <q>the without,</q> air <q>the within</q>;
<lb/>They are the Glory of the Omnipotent;
<lb/>God, touching this world, is <q>the infinite,</q>
<lb/>For lore to turn thee from Him is <q>the vile</q>;
<lb/><q>The above</q> is Paradise, Hell <q>the beneath,</q>
<lb/>And he is wicked that doth fear not God.
<lb/>Next as to that with many names whose will
<lb/>Prevaileth everywhere: O ancient! wisdom
<lb/>Hath many names, and wisdom compasseth
<lb/>The will of kings. One man may call it love,
<lb/>Another faith, but in its absence all
<lb/>Is pain and tyranny. The eloquent
<lb/>Term it uprightness and the fortunate
<lb/>Astuteness; 'tis at whiles long-suffering,
<lb/>At whiles trustworthiness, for speech therewith
<lb/>Is safe. So divers are the names of wisdom
<lb/>That they exceed account. Allow that naught
<lb/>Surpasseth it; it is the chief of goods,
<lb/>And knoweth this world’s hoarded mysteries,
<lb/>Which mortal vision cannot penetrate.
<lb/>Again, the stars that glitter in the sky
<lb/>Are what the master can afford to slight
<lb/>For understanding of the Maker’s work.
<lb/>The eye that gazeth cannot reckon them,
<lb/>And heaven above is unattainable
<pb n="104"/>
<lb/>As being measureless, so thou mayst scorn
<lb/>Such reckonings and processes of Fate.
<lb/>One that can follow not an arrow’s course,
<lb/>Shrewd though he be, will marvel still thereat;
<lb/>Then what can be more futile, favoured sir!
<lb/>Than to compute heaven’s stars? This much I know,
<lb/>And if another replication be
<lb/>Tis that the Maker’s mysteries are vast.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1555"/>
<lb/>When Caesar’s spokesman heard he kissed the ground,
<lb/>And offered praise. <q>World-ruling Shah,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Ask nothing more of God, for all the world
<lb/>Is thine to bid, the heads of all the great
<lb/>Are under thy control, the world hath not
<lb/>A king like thee in mind, thou praised by all
<lb/>The high-born nobles! while thy minister
<lb/>In knowledge passeth sage and archimage.
<lb/>All the philosophers are slaves to him,
<lb/>And at his wisdom hang their heads.</q>
<lb/>Bahram,
<lb/>On hearing, showed his pleasure, his heart brightened.
<lb/>He bade a robe of honour be made ready
<lb/>Of things most valued in his treasury,
<lb/>And gave the archimage withal ten purses
<lb/>Of drachms with raiment, steed, and much besides,
<lb/>And then the envoy of illustrious Caesar
<lb/>Went from the royal presence to his lodging.
<lb/>When Sol displayed its hand upon the sky
<lb/>The king of kings sat on his golden throne,
<lb/>And Caesar’s envoy came to court, and with him
<lb/>The high priest wise and worshipful. They went
<lb/>With joy before the king of kings, conversing
<lb/>On many matters, and the Shah’s high priest
<lb/>Said to the envoy: <q>Matchless, peerless sage!
<lb/>What thing is so injurious that we
<lb/>Must weep at its occurrence? What know’st thou
<pb n="105"/>
<lb/>So useful to the world that men become
<lb/>Exalted when it chanceth?</q></p>

<p>Said the envoy :—
<lb/><q>The wise aye will be great and powerful.
<lb/>The person of the foolish is more vile
<lb/>Than clay and undeserving of all good.
<lb/>Thou spakest of the unwise and of the wise,
<lb/>And hast received, maybe, the right response.</q></p>

<p>The high priest said to him: <q>Consider well,
<lb/>Reflect, and put not fish upon the dry.</q></p>

<p>The envoy said : <q>O man approved by all!
<lb/>One well may quote the sayings of the wise,
<lb/>But, if thou knowest another answer, speak,
<lb/>For knowledge giveth increment to fame.</q>
<lb/>The high priest answered: <q>Think, for speech resulteth
<lb/>From thought and brain, and know thou that the death
<lb/>Of one least harmful is the greatest loss
<lb/>Of all, but thou mayst joy when bad men die,
<lb/>Albeit death is common to us all.
<lb/>This then is profit and the other loss:
<lb/>Let wisdom judge the answer of us both.</q></p>

<p>The Roman gave assent to what he heard;
<lb/>Those words seemed excellent to him; he smiled,
<lb/>Did reverence to the Shah and said to him :—
<lb/><q>How happy is the country of Iran!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1556"/>
<lb/>For others look not on a king of kings
<lb/>Like thee, or on a high priest such as thine.
<lb/>Thou art the world’s high crown in understanding,
<lb/>In priests thou art the greatest of the great.
<lb/>Wouldst thou from Caesar tribute? Be it so,
<lb/>Because thy minister is sovereign
<lb/>In wisdom,</q> and his words rejoiced the king,
<lb/>Whose heart grew fresh as roses in the spring.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><head>How Bahram dismissed Caesar’s Envoy and charged his own Officials</head>
<p><pb n="106"/>
<lb/>The envoy left the presence of the Shah,
<lb/>The night came on, the Sable Banner rose,
<lb/>The men of lore were weary of discourse,
<lb/>The valiant monarch sought his ladies’ bower.
<lb/>The circling vault of heaven rested not,
<lb/>But roused the sleepers from their drowsihead,
<lb/>The fountain of the sun set up its flag,
<lb/>The world-Shah’s head woke lightly from repose,
<lb/>The chamberlain unlocked the audience-door,
<lb/>The king sat down upon the throne of gold.
<lb/>He bade a robe of honour be made ready,
<lb/>The envoy summoned. Indian scimitars
<lb/>With golden scabbards, noble steeds betrapped
<lb/>With gold, dinars, gems, musk, and spicery,
<lb/>Beyond that ancient man’s imaginings,
<lb/>The shrewd Shah gave the envoy, then was busied
<lb/>With his own folk’s affairs. By his command
<lb/>The high priest, who was counsellor withal,
<lb/>Approached him with a noble company,
<lb/>And he apportioned all the land among
<lb/>Those warlike paladins, gave drachms and steeds
<lb/>And signet-rings and casques, and, to the greatest,
<lb/>Thrones, crowns, and provinces. He filled the world
<lb/>With right, and small and great rejoiced in him.
<lb/>He banned the unjust with chilling words, unlargessed,
<lb/>And, after, thus harangued the archimages:—
<lb/><q>Ye sages worshipful and pure of heart!
<lb/>The world for us hath many memories
<lb/>Of doings of the Shahs unjust and just,
<lb/>Whose hands oft-times were stretched for ill what while
<lb/>Their persons lurked mid ease and luxury.<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<pb n="107"/>
<lb/>The world was frighted by these evil men,
<lb/>The hearts of all the good were rent in twain;
<lb/>All hands were occupied with evil-doing,
<lb/>And none was instant in the cause of God;
<lb/>The Div’s work everywhere prevailed; hearts ceased
<lb/>To fear the Master of the world. The head
<lb/>Of virtues and the hand of ill, the door
<lb/>Of understanding and the quest of wisdom,
<lb/>Are laid upon the Shah’s neck, and in him
<lb/>Especially are seen both right and wrong.
<lb/>My sire, who stretched his hand out to injustice,
<lb/>Was not a holy man, wise or devout.
<lb/>Hold not his actions strange, for rust attacked
<lb/>The bright steel of his heart. Consider too
<lb/>The experience of Jamshid and Shah Kaus
<lb/>For having sought the guidance of the Div.
<lb/>My father in like manner followed them,
<lb/>And washed not his dark soul in wisdom’s stream.
<lb/>His subjects writhed, and many lost their lives
<lb/>Through his severity. Now he hath gone,
<lb/>Hath left behind him but an evil name,
<lb/>And hath no praise from any, yet let us
<lb/>Give blessings to his soul, for God forbid
<lb/>That it should writhe through our vindictiveness;
<lb/>And now that I am seated on his throne
<lb/>His way will doubtless be to Paradise.
<lb/>I ask the world’s Lord to bestow upon me,
<lb/>Alike in public and in private, strength
<lb/>To treat my subjects with humanity,
<lb/>And make pure musk out of the darksome dust,
<lb/>That when therewith my body shall conjoin
<lb/>None wronged by me may pluck me by the skirt.
<lb/>Put ye too on the robe of uprightness,
<lb/>With hearts washed clean from wrong, for none is born
<lb/>Unless to die, be he of Persian, Arab,
<lb/>Or Roman race; death’s charge is lion-like,
<pb n="108"/>
<lb/>And from its claws none can withdraw the neck;
<lb/>It maketh quarry of the rending lion,
<lb/>The dragon’s body ’scapeth not its toils.
<lb/>Where are the heads and crowns of kings of kings!
<lb/>Where are the mighty and the glorious chiefs?
<lb/>Where are the cavaliers and haughty ones?
<lb/>I see no trace of them within the world.
<lb/>Where are its fair who joyed those chieftains’ souls?
<lb/>Know thou that all whose cheeks are 'neath the shroud
<lb/>Are wedded to the dust. Let all of us
<lb/>Have hands both clean and good, and not commit
<lb/>The world to evil ways. I swear by God,
<lb/>The Lord of all, who gave to me the Grace,
<lb/>With crown and throne, high birth and quality,
<lb/>That if an officer of mine shall wrong
<lb/>The mean or mighty by a pinch of dust
<lb/>I will consume his body in the fire,
<lb/>Or hang him to a gibbet by the neck.
<lb/>If in the watches of the night a thief
<lb/>Shall steal a poor man’s quilt I will make good
<lb/>His loss from mine own treasury with brocade,
<lb/>And wash the hearts of mourners from their woe;
<lb/>While if a sheep be taken from the flock
<lb/>In dark night or in snow-storm I will give
<lb/>Instead thereof a steed of noble race,
<lb/>And God forbid that I should ask for thanks.
<lb/>If in a war against mine enemies
<lb/>A cavalier is wounded in the fight
<lb/>I will assign him yearly maintenance,
<lb/>I will not leave his children in distress.
<lb/>Praise ye the Judge that knoweth what is good
<lb/>Throughout eternity. Let none lay hand
<lb/>On water or on fire except the priests
<lb/>That are fire-worshippers. Slay not draught-oxen,
<lb/>For they are of avail in husbandry,
<lb/>Unless past work and worthless to their owner.
<pb n="109"/>
<lb/>Pack-oxen too must not be slain, the land
<lb/>Else will grow void of grace. Deliberate
<lb/>In all things with the men of lore and break not
<lb/>The hearts of children that are fatherless.
<lb/>Be alien from the promptings of the Div,
<lb/>In fight ensue not feast. If I require
<lb/>My subjects to pay taxes I abjure
<lb/>God, throne, and crown. Since Yazdagird, my father,
<lb/>Did evil, to redress that wrong have I
<lb/>Disseminated justice. Let your hearts
<lb/>All joy to do it and in gratitude
<lb/>Observe the Cult of Fire. God may forgive him,
<lb/>And guide him out of Hell to Paradise.
<lb/>Give pleasure to the young, break not the hearts
<lb/>Of lieges, keep from drunkenness in age,
<lb/>For ’tis unseemly in the old to tope;
<lb/>Sin ye not therefore, for in age ’tis well
<lb/>To make your preparations to depart.
<lb/>If God, the righteous Judge, approveth us
<lb/>Let not the future trouble you to-day;
<lb/>Let there be pleasure in my subjects’ hearts,
<lb/>And let the nobles’ heads be free from grief.</q>
<lb/>The chiefs, on hearing and considering well
<lb/>His words, all wept that such an one was theirs,
<lb/>A Shah so wise and shrewd, acclaimed his worth,
<lb/>And hailed him as the great king of the earth.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><head>How Bahram went with his own Letter to Shangul, King of Hind</head>
<p>
<lb/>A wise wazir rose to his feet and said:—
<lb/><q>O judge of what is just and right! the world
<lb/>Hath ceased to fear malignants, toil and stress
<lb/>Have left our coasts. Howbeit famed Shangul
<pb n="110"/>
<lb/>Among the folk of Hind is still perverse;
<lb/>His bands of plunderers infest the earth
<lb/>From Hindustan up to the coasts of Chin.
<lb/>He will lay hands for ill upon Iran,
<lb/>And thou shouldst apprehend this. Thou art Shah;
<lb/>Shangul but wardeth Hind, so why should he
<lb/>Take toll of Sind and Chin? Consider this,
<lb/>And note his plans, for ill must not ensue.</q>
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing this, was full of thought,
<lb/>The world before him seemed a tangled brake,
<lb/>And thus he answered: <q>I will deal herewith
<lb/>In secret, not consulting any one.
<lb/>I will myself alone observe his troops,
<lb/>The conduct of his kingship and his throne,
<lb/>Approaching him as an ambassador,
<lb/>And not acquaint the Iranians and the lords.
<lb/>O holy archimage! write to Shangul
<lb/>A firm but courteous letter.</q>
</p>

<p>Thereupon
<lb/>His pious minister went with a scribe,
<lb/>And others that were indispensable,
<lb/>And canvassed all the case, brought paper, ink,
<lb/>And pen, and wrote a letter full of counsel,
<lb/>Instruction, knowledge, and the praise of God.
<lb/>It thus began: <q>From God be praise on those
<lb/>That seek His praise who is the Lord of all
<lb/>That is and is not. All things have their peers,
<lb/>But God is One. Of all that He bestoweth
<lb/>Upon His slaves, on sovereign and subject,
<lb/>Naught is more great than wisdom which illumeth
<lb/>Both. He whom wisdom gladdeneth will walk not
<lb/>The world for ill, and he that chooseth right
<lb/>Ne'er will repent thereof; he cannot savour
<lb/>Ill from the stream of knowledge. Wisdom looseth
<lb/>Man from mishap; may none be wrung therewith.
<lb/>Wisdom’s first token is that one should dread
<pb n="111"/>
<lb/>Ill-doing all one’s years and know oneself;
<lb/>Then must he search the world with wisdom’s eye,
<lb/>For wisdom is the diadem of kings,
<lb/>And jewel of the men of name withal.
<lb/>Thou know'st not thine own measure but dost plunge
<lb/>Thy soul in blood. Now, seeing that I am
<lb/>The monarch of the age, both good and ill
<lb/>Are laid to me. Do thou so reign that right
<lb/>May be preserved, for ill is manifest
<lb/>On all sides. Tis not kingly to make raids,
<lb/>And cotton with the ill-disposed. Thy grandsire
<lb/>Was vassal to us and thy sire a slave
<lb/>Before our Shahs, and none of us allowed
<lb/>Arrears in tribute out of Hindustan.
<lb/>Now mark the fortune of the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Who came thence 'gainst Iran. He gave to spoil
<lb/>All that he brought, and writhed for his ill deeds.
<lb/>I see thee also thus disposed, the same
<lb/>Perversity, same Glory, and same Faith.
<lb/>Now I have arms and treasures for the war,
<lb/>My soldiers are devoted and arrayed;
<lb/>Thou canst not stand against my gallant men,
<lb/>And there is not a general in Hind.
<lb/>Thou art conceited of thy might, preferring
<lb/>Thine own rill to the river. Now behold!
<lb/>I have dispatched an envoy to thee, one
<lb/>Of knowledge, eloquence, and high degree.
<lb/>Send tribute or make war and fortify
<lb/>The passes. Be our blessing on his soul
<lb/>Whose warp and woof are equity and wisdom.</q>
</p>

<p>Whenas air’s breath had made the writing dry
<lb/>The writer of the letter folded it,
<lb/>And then the scribe addressed it on this wise:—
<lb/><q>From this world’s king, the monarch shrewd of wit,
<lb/>The lord of government, the lord of might,
<lb/>The world’s possessor, generous Bahram Gir,
<pb n="112"/>
<lb/>Who on the day of Ard in month Khurdad
<lb/>Received from Yazdagird the royal crown,
<lb/>Chief of the marches, guardian of the realm,
<lb/>To whom Saklab and Rum are tributary,
<lb/>This to Shangul, who ruleth over Hind
<lb/>From Sind up to the river of Kannuj.</q>
<note n="1">The Ganges is meant.</note>
<lb/>The monarch sealed the letter with his signet,
<lb/>And then made ready for the chase, but none
<lb/>Of all the host knew of his purposes
<lb/>Except the nobles of his company.
<lb/>Thus he drew nigh to Hindustan and crossed
<lb/>The river of magician-land.
<note n="2">Hindustan. Cf. Vol. i. p. 163.</note> On nearing
<lb/>The palace of Shangul he gazed upon
<lb/>The hall of audience with its gate and curtain.
<lb/>It rose aloft in air, and at the gate
<lb/>There was no lack of arms and equipage,
<lb/>For there stood cavaliers and elephants
<lb/>Amid a din of gongs and Indian bells.
<lb/>He stood there all amazed and lost in thought,
<lb/>Then on this wise addressed the curtain-keepers,
<lb/>The servants and officials of the gate:—
<lb/><q>An envoy to this court am I, deputed
<lb/>By conquering Shah Bahram.</q>
</p>

<p>The chamberlain
<lb/>Went to the royal presence from the curtain.
<lb/>They raised it by the king’s command and brought
<lb/>The envoy in with all respect. Bahram Gir
<lb/>Advanced with stately step, and saw a chamber
<lb/>With crystal roof. On drawing near Shangul
<lb/>Bahram beheld him seated on his throne
<lb/>Of majesty, and crowned. The steps that led
<lb/>Up to that golden throne were all of crystal.
<lb/>There sat the king in all his Grace and might,
<pb n="113"/>
<lb/>Arrayed in silver broidered with gold thread
<lb/>Beset with many a gem. Bahram beheld
<lb/>The monarch’s brother on an ante-throne,
<lb/>And wearing on his head a jewelled crown.
<lb/>The minister sat by; the monarch’s son
<lb/>Stood there before the throne. The Shah drew nigh
<lb/>Thereto, did reverence, and paused awhile,
<lb/>Then quickly loosed his tongue. <q>I have,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>A letter written in our tongue on silk,
<lb/>Sent to the king of Hind by Shah Bahram—
<lb/>The world’s lord who possesseth crown and throne.</q>
<lb/>The king, on hearing what Bahram said, bade
<lb/>To bring a golden ante-throne. They set him
<lb/>Upon that seat of gold, and from the gate
<lb/>Called in his comrades. Seated thus he said:—
<lb/><q>Exalted king! I will unloose my lips
<lb/>When thou commandest. May both good and greatness
<lb/>Be ever thine.</q>
</p>

<p>Shangul replied: <q>Proceed,
<lb/>For heaven’s blessing is on those who speak.</q>
<lb/>Bahram rejoined: <q>That Shah of royal race,
<lb/>Whose like no mother in the world hath borne,
<lb/>The exalted prince, the glory of the state,
<lb/>Whose justice turneth bane to antidote,
<lb/>To whom all potentates are tributary,
<lb/>Whose prey is lions in the chase, and who,
<lb/>On taking up the scimitar in fight,
<lb/>Converteth deserts into seas of blood,
<lb/>In generosity like clouds in spring,
<lb/>In whose sight treasures and dinars are vile,
<lb/>Hath sent the king of Hind an embassy,
<lb/>And letter writ on silk in Pahlavi.</q>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><head>How Shangul received the Letter from Bahram and made Reply</head>
<p>
<lb/><pb n="114"/>The king, on hearing this, asked for the letter,
<lb/>And marvelled at that chief. A noble scribe
<lb/>Read it, whereat the monarch’s face became
<lb/>Like gall. He said: <q>O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Haste not to speak, and act not haughtily.
<lb/>Thy Shah displayeth his imperiousness,
<lb/>Witness thy journey hither. Should one ask
<lb/>For tribute out of Hindustan the wise
<lb/>Would disavow him. If thy master speaketh
<lb/>Of host and treasure, and of giving land
<lb/>And cities up to woe... well, other kings
<lb/>Are cranes, I am an eagle; they are dust,
<lb/>I am a sea. None fighteth with the stars,
<lb/>Or seeketh fame by warring with the sky.
<lb/>Worth is much better than the useless talk
<lb/>That maketh wise men hold thee in contempt.
<lb/>Ye have not manhood, knowledge, realm or city;
<lb/>Your share of sovereignty is only loss.
<lb/>My whole land is a hidden treasury
<lb/>Whereon mine ancestors have laid no hand,
<lb/>Beside my store of mail for man and steed,
<lb/>Which, if my treasurer should bring it forth,
<lb/>Would ask for elephants to bear the keys,
<lb/>If mighty elephants could carry them;
<lb/>And should I count my swords and coats of mail
<lb/>The stars would seem contemptible in sum
<lb/>To thee. The earth will not sustain my host,
<lb/>My throne, and mighty elephants. If thou
<lb/>Shouldst multiply a thousand thousand-fold
<lb/>'Twould be the sum of those that call me king.
<lb/>Mine are the jewels of the hills and seas,
<lb/>I am the present mainstay of the world.
<pb n="115"/>
<lb/>The founts of aloe, musk, and ambergris,
<lb/>The hoards of undried camphor and the drugs
<lb/>That cure the suffering, whoever shall ail
<lb/>Throughout the world, are plenteous in my realm,
<lb/>As well as silver, gold, and jewelry,
<lb/>While fourscore kings with crowns of gold up-gird
<lb/>Their loins at my behest. My land is full
<lb/>Of mountain, stream, and chasm; not e’en a div
<lb/>Would find his way across it. From Kannauj
<lb/>Up to the marches of Iran and thence
<lb/>Right to Saklab and Chin the chiefs are all
<lb/>My men and cannot choose but homage me.
<lb/>The watchmen of Khutan, of Hind, and Chin
<lb/>Use in their challenges no name but mine;
<lb/>All speak the praises of my crown and grow
<lb/>More serviceable. In my women’s bower
<lb/>The daughter of Faghfur of Chin invoketh
<lb/>God’s blessing on me—me of all the world.
<lb/>By her I have a lion-hearted son,
<lb/>Whose scimitar despoileth mountains’ hearts.
<lb/>No one since Kai Kaous and Kai Kobad
<lb/>E’er hath concerned himself about this land.
<lb/>Three hundred thousand warlike troops withal
<lb/>Acclaim me. Of allies I have twelve hundred,
<lb/>Who all are wholly in my confidence;
<lb/>All are my kith and kin by long descent,
<lb/>And stand before me here in Hind. Their war-cry
<lb/>Would make the lions of the jungle gnaw
<lb/>Their claws. If there were any precedent
<lb/>For chiefs to slay an envoy out of wrath
<lb/>Thy head and body would I part, and let
<lb/>Thy raiment wail for thee.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram replied:—
<lb/><q>As thou art great, O king! sow not the seed

<lb/>Art wise choose not the pathway of perverseness.</q></q>
<pb n="116"/>
<lb/>Produce now from thy court two men of lore,
<lb/>Of fluent tongue, and happy in discourse,
<lb/>And if in rede and wisdom they excel
<lb/>One of these men with me then I have done
<lb/>With this thy land, for wise men spurn not words;
<lb/>Or else choose out among the warriors
<lb/>That wield in Hindustan the massive mace
<lb/>A hundred horsemen to fight one of us,
<lb/>And we, what time thy wit and worth shall stand
<lb/>Revealed, will ask not tribute from thy land.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><head>How Shangul prepared a Feast for Bahram, and how Bahram displayed his Prowess</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul, on hearing this, said to Bahram:—
<lb/><q>Thy counsel sorteth not with manliness.
<lb/>Abide a season and relax thyself,
<lb/>Why parley to no purpose?</q>
<lb/>They made ready
<lb/>A splendid hall. Bahram reposed till noon,
<lb/>And when the Crown that lighteneth the world
<lb/>Had reached its height the feast was all prepared
<lb/>According to the bidding of the king,
<lb/>And zealous servants were about the hall.
<lb/>When they had spread the board before Shangul
<lb/>He bade a servant: <q>Summon to the feast
<lb/>The envoy of the Iranian king, the man
<lb/>Of fluent utterance and novel aims.
<lb/>Bring his companions too and seat them where
<lb/>Ambassadors are placed.</q>
<lb/>Bahram came quickly,
<lb/>Sat at the board and oped his hand to bread,
<lb/>But shut his lips to speech. The eating done,
<pb n="117"/>
<lb/>They set themselves to quaff and called for harpists
<lb/>And wine. The scent of musk rose from the feast,
<lb/>The hall was spread with golden carpetings.
<lb/>Now when the lords were merry in their cups,
<lb/>And recked not of the future, king Shangul
<lb/>Bade two strong men attend, men fit to wrestle
<lb/>Against the Div. These noble athletes came,
<lb/>And girt their loincloths round them. Those two youths
<lb/>Contended lustily and strained and writhed
<lb/>Together. Now Bahram took up a cup
<lb/>Of crystal and the wine confused his brain.
<lb/>He spake thus to Shangul: <q>O king, bid me
<lb/>To gird me for a bout, for when I wrestle
<lb/>Against the strong I am away from harm
<lb/>And drunkenness.</q>
<lb/>Shangul said smiling: <q>Rise,
<lb/>And, if thou shalt overcome them, shed their blood.</q>
<lb/>Bahram, on hearing this, rose to his feet,
<lb/>And boldly bending down the upright form
<lb/>Of him whose waist he clutched (a lion so
<lb/>Might seize upon wild onager) he flung
<lb/>His foeman down so that his bones were broken,
<lb/>And all the colour left his cheeks. Shangul
<lb/>Was in amazement at the victor’s mien,
<lb/>His stature and his shoulders and his strength,
<lb/>Invoked God in the Indian tongue and deemed
<lb/>Bahram to be a match for forty men.
<lb/>When they were all bemused with pleasant wine
<lb/>They left the hall of jewelled tracery
<lb/>And, when the vault of heaven donned musk-hued silk,
<lb/>Both young and old slept after banqueting.
<lb/>Shangul went to his sleeping-place, the wine
<lb/>Had turned his looks and thoughts from king Bahram.
<lb/>Now when the musky-scented Veil was changed
<lb/>To gold, and in the sky the sun appeared,
<pb n="118"/>
<lb/>The king of Indians mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And went forth to the Ground with polo-stick
<lb/>In hand. His servants bore his bow and arrows,
<lb/>And for a while he rode to please himself,
<lb/>Then ordered Shah Bahram to mount and take
<lb/>His royal bow in hand. Bahram replied:—
<lb/><q>I have a number of Iranian horsemen
<lb/>With me, O king! and they are fain to ply
<lb/>The arrow and the polo-stick when bidden
<lb/>By the most noble king.</q>
</p>

<p>Shangul replied:—
<lb/><q>The arrows and the bow are doubtlessly
<lb/>The mainstays of the cavalier. Do thou,
<lb/>Who hast such limbs and neck and might of hand,
<lb/>String up thy bow and shoot.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram Gur strung
<lb/>His bow and urged his steed with shouts. He took
<lb/>And shot an arrow that destroyed the mark.
<lb/>The sportsmen and the warriors ’gan to call
<lb/>Their blessings down upon him, one and all.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><head>How Shangul suspected Bahram and kept him from Iran</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul, misdoubting of Bahram, thought thus:—
<lb/><q>This stature, Grace, and skill in archery
<lb/>Resemble not a mere ambassador’s
<lb/>Of Hindustan, of Turkistan, or Persia,
<lb/>But, be he of the Shah’s race or a noble,
<lb/>Twere well I call him brother,</q> smiled and said
<lb/>Thus to Bahram: <q>Famed, high-born prince! thou art
<lb/>No doubt the Shah’s own brother, being dowered
<lb/>With vigour, strength, and skill in archery,
<pb n="119"/>
<lb/>Because the Grace of kings, the might of lions,
<lb/>Are thine. Art thou then but a gallant chief?</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram said: <q>King of Hind! discredit not
<lb/>Ambassadors. I am not of the seed
<lb/>Of Yazdagird or Shah. To call him brother
<lb/>Would be a crime in me. A stranger I,
<lb/>Come from Iran, no seeker after knowledge,
<lb/>No sage. Dismiss me for the way is long,
<lb/>And I must not incur the Shah’s displeasure.</q>
</p>

<p>Shangul replied: <q>Be not importunate,
<lb/>For I have somewhat still to say to thee.
<lb/>Thou must not be so eager to depart,
<lb/>For hasty going prospereth not. Abide
<lb/>With us and set thy heart at ease. If thou
<lb/>Wilt have not mellowed wine then take it crude.</q>
<note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>He said thereafter to his own adept:—
<lb/><q>I have a secret for thee. If this man
<lb/>Be not sib to Bahram, or in degree
<lb/>Above his paladins, 'twill prove a marvel
<lb/>To wise men’s hearts. We must not trust his words.
<lb/>Address him courteously and say: <q>Abide;
<lb/>There is no cause for thee to leave Kannauj.</q>
<lb/>Sayst thou: <q>He will detect deceit herein?</q>
<lb/>If words of mine may terrify his heart
<lb/>It will be better far for thee to speak,
<lb/>And talk to him in convenable terms.
<lb/>Say thus to him: <q>Tis well for thee to gain
<lb/>More estimation with the king of Hind.
<lb/>Now if thou will abide with him, and further
<lb/>His subtle policy, thou shalt possess
<lb/>The goodliest march of Hind because the king
<lb/>Hath thee in high esteem. ’Twill be a land
<lb/>Of never-ending springtide where the streams
<lb/>Breathe of the rose. The fortunate ne’er quit
<lb/>Kannauj where twice a year the fruit-trees bear,

<pb n="120"/>
<lb/>Where there are treasures, gems, dinars, and drachms,
<lb/>And where drachms can be had hearts are not sad.
<lb/>The king is gracious and for love of thee
<lb/>He smileth when he looketh on thy face.</q>
<lb/>What time ye meet speak thou whate’er thou knowest
<lb/>To this effect and then inquire his name,
<lb/>For that will joy my heart. Should our land please him
<lb/>Our favours would surpass his excellence,
<lb/>We would appoint him captain of the host
<lb/>Anon, in favour highest in the land.</q>
</p>

<p>The king’s experienced minister departed,
<lb/>Informed Bahram, and pointed him his way,
<lb/>Then asked his name because without his name
<lb/>No answer would suffice. Bahram changed colour,
<lb/>On hearing this, perplexed for his reply.
<lb/>At length he said: <q>O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Make me not wan of visage in two realms.
<lb/>I will quit not the Shah for any treasure
<lb/>However much I may be pinched by want.
<lb/>The teachings of our Faith are otherwise,
<lb/>As are our estimations, wonts, and ways,
<lb/>And every one that turneth from his king
<lb/>Is lost by such revolt. No man of wisdom
<lb/>Is eager for addition; bad and good
<lb/>Are transient with us. Where is Faridun,
<lb/>The master of the crown, he that restored
<lb/>The age? Where are those chiefs of royal race,
<lb/>The world-lords Kai Khusrau and Kai Kobad?
<lb/>Thou hast withal some knowledge of Bahram,
<lb/>The young, ambitious, and imperious,
<lb/>Who, if I cross his purpose, will avail
<lb/>To bring the world in ruins on my head,
<lb/>Leave Hindustan not field or fell but bear
<lb/>Off to Iran the dust of Wizard-land.
<note n="2">Cf. p. 112 and note.</note>
<lb/>My better plan is to return to court,
<lb/>And to the purview of the conquering Shah.
<lb/>If thou wouldst have my name it is Barzu;
<lb/>My monarch and my parents call me so.
<lb/>Communicate mine answer to Shangul,
<lb/>For I have stayed long in an alien realm.</q>
</p>

<p>The minister, on hearing this reply,
<lb/>Told all that he had heard before the king,
<lb/>Who frowned and said: <q>He holdeth him aloof,
<lb/>But I will take such order that this Light
<lb/>Of hosts shall end his days.</q>
</p>

<p>There was a wolf
<note n="3">Perhaps for <foreign>gurg,</foreign> wolf, we ought to read <foreign>karg,</foreign> rhinoceros.
The word is spelt both with g and k in C. and is made to rhyme with
<foreign>aarg,</foreign> death, and <foreign>tagarg,</foreign> hail. Cf. NIN, p. 55, note.</note>
<lb/>Within the monarch’s coasts of bulk so vast
<lb/>That it withstood the wind. The lions fled
<lb/>The woods before it, and the swift-winged vultures
<lb/>The sky. Thereat all Hind was full of fear:
<lb/>Its howlings deafened those most keen of ear.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><head>How Bahram fought with the Wolf at the Bidding of Shangul and slew it</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul said to Bahram: <q>O man approved!
<lb/>All enterprises prosper in thy hands.
<lb/>A wood near by my city troubleth me.
<lb/>There is a wolf there like a crocodile,
<lb/>And rendeth lions’ hearts and leopards’ hides.
<lb/>Let it be thine to go against this wolf,
<lb/>And pierce its hide all over with thine arrows.
<lb/>The world may find rest then and by thy Grace,
<lb/>Victorious one! Thenceforth in mine esteem,
<lb/>And that of all this noble company,
<pb n="122"/>
<lb/>Thy station shall be such that evermore
<lb/>The folk of Hind and Chin all shall acclaim thee.</q>
<lb/>Bahram, the honest, said: <q>I need a guide;
<lb/>Then by God’s strength, when I behold the beast,
<lb/>Thou shalt perceive its garment soaked in blood.</q>
<note n="1">Garment for skin as in Job ali. 13.</note>
<lb/>Shangul provided him a guide that knew
<lb/>The creature’s lair and haunt, and then Bahram
<lb/>Went with his trusty guide toward the wood
<lb/>Of that blood-shedding wolf. Much spake the guide
<lb/>About its lair, its height and breadth and bulk,
<lb/>Showed where it was and went back while Bahram
<lb/>Approached apace. Iranians thronged behind him
<lb/>With loins girt for the fray, but when they saw
<lb/>Afar so vast a wood, the monster’s bulk,
<lb/>And lair that it had made, all said: <q>O Shah!
<lb/>Adventure not; thou wilt surpass the bounds
<lb/>Of hardihood because, however brave
<lb/>Thou art in fight, none hath fought rocks and mountains.
<lb/>Say to Shangul: <q>This may not be. I have
<lb/>No sanction for this combat from the Shah.
<lb/>I fight when I am bidden so that he,
<lb/>On hearing of it, may advance my rank.</q></q>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>If holy God hath given
<lb/>My dust to Hindustan how can I die
<lb/>Elsewhere? That is beyond me.</q>
</p>

<p>That brave youth
<lb/>Strung up his bow, and thou hadst said: <q>He holdeth
<lb/>His own life cheap!</q>
<lb/>He sped toward the wolf
<lb/>With head all rage and heart resigned to death.
<lb/>He grasped his royal bow and, having drawn
<lb/>Some poplar arrows from his quiver, poured
<lb/>His shafts like hail till by that token anguish
<lb/>O’ercame the wolf. On seeing the beast’s end nigh,
<pb n="123"/>
<lb/>Bahram, exchanging bow for sword, smote off
<lb/>Its head, exclaiming: <q>In the name of God,
<lb/>Who hath not mate or peer and gave to me
<lb/>Such Grace and might! By His command the sun
<lb/>Is bright in heaven.</q>
<lb/>He bade bring wain and oxen
<lb/>To carry that wolf’s carcase from the wood.
<lb/>They bore it. When Shangul saw it afar
<lb/>He had his banquet-hall decked with brocade,
<lb/>And when the mighty king sat on his throne
<lb/>He set Bahram upon the seat of honour
<lb/>While all the chiefs of Hind, and cavaliers
<lb/>Of Chin, applauded him. The lords all came
<lb/>With offerings and spake thus to Bahram:—
<lb/><q>None ever did a deed to equal thine;
<lb/>Its brilliancy is more than eyes can bear.</q>
</p>

<p>As for Shangul he was both glad and grieved,
<lb/>Appearing cheerful and depressed by turns.
<lb/>There was a dragon, an amphibious beast,
<lb/>Which haunted streams and sunned itself ashore;
<lb/>It, with its breath, could suck huge elephants
<lb/>Down, and raise waves upon the dark blue sea.
<lb/>Shangul spake thus to his companions,
<lb/>His clever confidants: <q>By turns this envoy,
<lb/>This lion-man, doth please and trouble me.
<lb/>If he remained he would be my support,
<lb/>The ruler of Kannauj and of my realm,
<lb/>But if he goeth from me to Iran
<lb/>Bahram will devastate Kannauj; with such
<lb/>A servitor to such a lord this land
<lb/>Will lose both hue and odour. All the night
<lb/>Have I been musing o’er his case and framing
<lb/>A fresh device—to send him to that dragon,
<lb/>Which surely he will 'scape not. Then shall I
<pb n="124"/>
<lb/>Be censured not on his account if he
<lb/>Will fight with dragons.</q>
<lb/>So he called Bahram,
<lb/>Told stories of the mighty men, and said:—
<lb/><q>God, Author of the soul, hath led thee hither
<lb/>Out of the country of Iran to purge
<lb/>The ills of Hindustan as is the way
<lb/>Of men of name. A matter fraught with pain
<lb/>And travail is confronting us, of travail
<lb/>At first but treasure in the end. If thou
<lb/>Accomplish this depart on thy return
<lb/>With my good wishes home.</q>
</p>

<p>The Shah replied:—
<lb/><q>I may not leave the way of thy behests,
<lb/>But will perform thy bidding faithfully
<lb/>Unless the heaven itself shall turn awry.</q>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><head>How Bahram slew a Dragon</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul said to Bahram: <q>Within my realm
<lb/>There is a dragon—an exceeding bale—
<lb/>Which fareth both by land and stream to hunt
<lb/>The lashing crocodile. Thou mayst devise
<lb/>A scheme to rid thereof the realm of Hind,
<lb/>Whose tribute thou shalt carry to Iran,
<lb/>For all the country will assent thereto,
<lb/>And likewise gifts therefrom of aloe-wood,
<lb/>Of swords, and goods of all kinds, with the tribute.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: <q>Great king and sovereign,
<lb/>Whose word is law in Hind! by God, the Just
<lb/>And Holy One's, command I will cut off
<lb/>The footing of the dragon from the earth,
<lb/>But must be shown its lair whereof I know not.</q>
<pb n="125"/>
<lb/>Shangul accordingly dispatched a guide
<lb/>To show it to Bahram who went his way
<lb/>With thirty horsemen, nobles of Iran
<lb/>And swordsmen. Hasting to the stream he saw
<lb/>The dragon mid the gloom, its form, its writhing,
<lb/>And furiousness, fire flashing from its eyes.
<lb/>The nobles of Iran with loud exclaims,
<lb/>And shrewdly troubled at that dragon, said:—
<lb/><q>Hold not this dragon as thou didst the wolf,
<lb/>O king! the other day. By one mishap
<lb/>Give not Iran up to the wind, rejoice not
<lb/>Thy foemen here.</q>
</p>

<p>The bold Bahram replied:—
<lb/><q>'T must entrust my life to all-just God.
<lb/>If I am doomed to perish by this dragon
<lb/>My time will be not lengthened or decreased
<lb/>By hardihood.</q>
<lb/>He strung his bow, he chose
<lb/>Shafts dipped in bane of milk, and 'gan to shower them
<lb/>Down on the dragon, wheeling all the while,
<lb/>Like horsemen in the fray, to left and right.
<lb/>He sewed up with steel points the dragon's mouth,
<lb/>Whose venom scorched the brambles, then he shot
<lb/>Four arrows at its head, and blood and poison
<lb/>Poured down its breast. The dragon's body failed
<lb/>By reason of those shafts, and all the ground
<lb/>Ran with its gore and bane. Then lightly drew
<lb/>Bahram his sword of watered steel and pierced
<lb/>The dragon’s heart right dourly, hacked its neck
<lb/>With sword and battle-ax, and flung to earth
<lb/>Its lifeless form. The dragon overthrown,
<lb/>He turned in duty to the Lord and said:—
<lb/><q>O Judge who judgest righteously! 'tis Thou
<lb/>That slewest this great dragon, for who else
<pb n="126"/>
<lb/>Hath might enough? Thou art Thy servants’ refuge
<lb/>From every ill.</q>
</p>

<p>He sought the king of Hind,
<lb/>The noble chieftain of the Sindian host,
<lb/>And said: <q>The king is freed from these attacks
<lb/>By His decree—the Judge and Nourisher's.</q>
</p>

<p>Shangul grieved, hearing this, because Bahram
<lb/>Was in the saddle still. He bade that wains
<lb/>And oxen should convey the dragon's carcase
<lb/>To plain from forest, while all Hindustan
<lb/>Invoked upon Iran the All-Just's blessing:—
<lb/><q>For there a cavalier like this was born
<lb/>To fight with dragons. One who hath such limbs,
<lb/>Such stature and such bearing cannot be
<lb/>But equal to the king in his degree.</q>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><head>How Shangul became troubled about Bahram and
gave a Daughter to him</head>
<p>
<lb/>All men rejoiced except Shangul whose heart
<lb/>Was pained, the matter made his visage wan,
<lb/>And when night came he summoned his wise men,
<lb/>Both those of his own kin and aliens,
<lb/>And thus he said: <q>This man of Shah Bahram’s,
<lb/>Who hath such might, such limbs, and mastery,
<lb/>Do what I may, is worsted by no toil!
<lb/>Now if he goeth from us to Iran,
<lb/>And cometh to the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>He will depreciate my host and say
<lb/>That here in Hindustan there is no horseman,
<lb/>And so my foemen may grow insolent.
<lb/>I will behead the envoy, will destroy him
<lb/>By stealth. What say ye? What do ye advise?</q>
<pb n="127"/>
<lb/><q>Bring not thy heart, O king!</q> the wise men
answered,
<lb/><q>To sorrow by such deeds. For thee to slay
<lb/>The ambassadors of kings would be an act
<lb/>Unwise and senseless. No one e’er conceived
<lb/>A thought on this wise. Compass no such plan.
<lb/>Thou wilt be execrated by the chiefs,
<lb/>And people should respect their sovereign.
<lb/>By putting this man’s head within the shears
<lb/>Thou wilt bring longsome trouble on thy land.
<lb/>Forthwith will come an army from Iran,
<lb/>And with a potentate like Shah Bahram;
<lb/>None of us in these regions will survive,
<lb/>And thou wilt have to wash thy hands of kingship.
<lb/>This man is our deliverer from the dragon,
<lb/>And slaying should compensate not his toils;
<lb/>Here hath he killed the dragon and the wolf;
<lb/>Give him more life, not death.</q>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Shangul grew gloomy, for the sages’ words
<lb/>Perturbed him. Passing thus the night, at dawn
<lb/>He sent a messenger to Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And, when they were together privily
<lb/>Without a minister or counsellor,
<lb/>Said: <q>O thou Joy of hearts! thou hast prevailed.
<lb/>Attempt no greater feat. I will bestow
<lb/>My daughter on thee as thy wife, for thus
<lb/>Shall I be profited in word and deed.
<lb/>This done, abide with me, for thou wilt have
<lb/>No colour to depart. I will appoint thee
<lb/>The captain of the host and give thee kingship
<lb/>In Hindustan.</q>
<lb/>Bahram was in amaze,
<lb/>And mused upon his throne, his birth, and glory.
<lb/><q>There is no remedy for one’s own acts,</q>
</p>

<p>He thought, <q>and this thing cannot bring reproach;
<lb/>Besides by this I may preserve my life,
<lb/>And look again upon Iranian soil,
<lb/>For, as the case is, we have tarried long;
<lb/>The lion is taken in the fox’s net!</q>
<lb/>Thus said he to Shangul: <q>I will obey
<lb/>Thy hest and make thy word my rule of life.
<lb/>However of thy daughters choose me one,
<lb/>Who, when I see her, may obtain my praise.</q>
<lb/>The king of Hind, on hearing this, rejoiced,
<lb/>And decked his halls with painted silk of Chin.
<lb/>Shangul’s three daughters came like jocund spring
<lb/>In all their bravery, their scents, their colours,
<lb/>And looks, and then he bade Bahram Gir: <q>Go,
<lb/>Prepare thy heart to see a novel sight.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gir went immediately, beheld
<lb/>The hall, and of those moon-faced maids chose one
<lb/>Like jocund springtide, Sapinud by name,
<lb/>All grace and modesty, all wit and charm;
<lb/>On him Shangul bestowed her—one that seemed
<lb/>A straight-stemmed cypress and a smokeless lamp—
<lb/>Then chose the richest of his treasuries,
<lb/>Gave to the moon-faced maid the key thereof,
<lb/>Called for Bahram’s companions, cavaliers
<lb/>Of noble rank and masterful, and gave them
<lb/>Dinars and drachms and every kind of wealth,
<lb/>With camphor, aloe-wood, and ambergris,
<lb/>Steeds, golden trappings, girdles, and for those
<lb/>Of highest rank, gold crowns, while for Bahram
<lb/>He had a turquoise crown and glorious throne
<lb/>Of ivory prepared, and decked his palace
<lb/>Of jewelled tracery. All men of name
<lb/>Within Kannauj resorted to that place
<lb/>Of feasting, waiting on their king with joy.
<lb/>They spent a se’nnight thus with wine in hand,
<lb/>All glad and jocund in the banquet-hall,
<lb/>With Sapinud beside Bahram, the king,
<lb/>Like wine in crystal goblet glittering.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><head>How Faghfur of Chin wrote to Bahram and how he replied</head>
<p>
<lb/>Intelligence came to Faghfur of Chin:—
<lb/><q>A man of Grace and courage from Iran
<lb/>Hath reached Shangul as an ambassador,
<lb/>And verily is of heroic race.
<lb/>Great exploits have been wrought in Hind by
<lb/>The hand too of this valiant lion-man
<lb/>Through resolution and the might of fortune.
<lb/>Naught but the crown and throne befitteth him,
<lb/>And on him hath Shangul bestowed a daughter,
<lb/>So that his diadem might reach the moon.</q>
</p>

<p>That mighty world-lord wrote to Shah Bahram
<lb/>A letter superscribed: <q>From him that is
<lb/>The monarch of the world, the head of nobles,
<lb/>And crown of chiefs, to that ambassador
<lb/>Of Persia who with thirty comrades reached
<lb/>Kannuj,</q> and then proceeded: <q>I have had
<lb/>Accounts of thee, thou famed and glorious man!
<lb/>About thy wisdom, prudence, and advice,
<lb/>And how thou standest steadfast everywhere,
<lb/>So that the wolf and that notorious dragon
<lb/>Could 'scape not from thy shafts and scimitar.
<lb/>The lady given to thee is my kin,
<lb/>Her dust is worth the whole of Hindustan,
<lb/>And thou hast raised thy head on high by thus
<lb/>Affining with this mighty potentate,
<lb/>While in Iran 'twill magnify the Shah,
<lb/>Whose crown well may bediadem the moon,
<lb/>Because his envoy took fit comrades, reached
<lb/>Kannauj, and clasped a Moon upon his breast.
<lb/>Now bear the toil, come hither, and abide
<lb/>Within this land so long as thou mayst wish.
<lb/>I will illume mine eyes with seeing thee,
<pb n="130"/>
<lb/>And make thy rede the breastplate of my soul.
<lb/>Thou shalt go hence at will. I will not bid thee:
<lb/><q>Abide awhile.</q> So with a robe of honour,
<lb/>And wealth, depart with joy—thou and thy chiefs,
<lb/>Well furnished. Tis no shame for thee to come
<lb/>To me; I have no quarrel with the Shah.
<lb/>On no wise be remiss in coming hither,
<lb/>And, when thou wouldst depart, then tarry not.</q>
</p>

<p>This letter reached Bahram Gir and perturbed him.
<lb/>He called a scribe, wrote his reply, and planted
<lb/>A tree within the orchard of revenge.
<lb/>The letter thus began: <q>I have received
<lb/>Thy words. Thou canst have seen no land but Chin,
<lb/>For thou hast superscribed thy letter thus:
<lb/><q>From him that is the monarch of the world,
<lb/>The most exalted of the glorious chiefs.</q>
<lb/>It is not so; new-fangled majesty
<lb/>Like thine I do not recognise. Bahram Gur
<lb/>Alone is king of kings; we know none other.
<lb/>No man remembereth any king like him
<lb/>In courage, knowledge, Grace, and lineage.
<lb/>Him I acknowledge, as victorious world-lord,
<lb/>And know him greater than all other kings.
<lb/>Again, for what thou saidst about my deeds,
<lb/>And of my toil endured in Hindustan,
<lb/>That too was all the star of Shah Bahram,
<lb/>Who hath Grace, throne, and fame. Accomplishment
<lb/>Is the Iranians' own, they hold fierce lions
<lb/>Of no account. They all are single-hearted;
<lb/>They worship God, and in their blest estate
<lb/>They fear no ill. Again, if king Shangul
<lb/>Bestowed his daughter on me I achieved
<lb/>That honour by my courage. He is great,
<lb/>By his own courage driveth wolf from sheep,
<lb/>And, thinking good to make affinity
<lb/>With me, bestowed on me his worthy child.
<pb n="131"/>
<lb/>Again, for what thou saidst: <q>Arise and come,
<lb/>And I will guide thee unto every good,</q>
<lb/>The Shah sent me to Hind, and shall I go
<lb/>To Chin for painted silk? If I propose
<lb/>A course like that he will approve it not.
<lb/>Thou sayest further: <q>I will send thee home
<lb/>Enriched with treasures.</q>God hath set me past
<lb/>The need of clutching after others' goods.
<lb/>I praise Bahram for all his bounty to me,
<lb/>And offer up thanksgiving to my God
<lb/>Three watches of the day and of the night.
<lb/>And fourthly, all the praise that thou hast lavished
<lb/>Upon me in excess of my deserts,
<lb/>This I accept from thee, O king of Chin!
<lb/>And will report it to the Shah. May God
<lb/>Give thee so many blessings that the sky
<lb/>May not distinguish 'twixt their warp and woof.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram dispatched this letter to the king
<lb/>Of Chin when he had sealed it with his ring.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><head>How Bahram fled from Hindustan to Iran with the
Daughter of Shangul</head>
<p>
<lb/>When with the daughter of Shangul Bahram
<lb/>Consorted she found out that he was Shah;
<lb/>By night and day she wept for love of him,
<lb/>And kept her eyes upon his face. Her father
<lb/>Heard of her love and ceased to doubt Bahram.
<lb/>One day the pair sat happily, discussing
<lb/>Things great and small, and Shah Bahram spake thus:—
<lb/><q>I know that thou dost wish me well, so I
<lb/>Will tell to thee a secret; keep it close.
<lb/>I would quit Hindustan. Dost thou consent
<pb n="132"/>
<lb/>Thereto? I will take thee withal, but none
<lb/>Among this folk must know. Within Iran
<lb/>My state surpasseth this and, furthermore,
<lb/>The Almighty is mine aid. If thou wilt go
<lb/>Thy wise decision will promote thy weal,
<lb/>In every place thy title shall be <q>queen,</q>
<lb/>And thine own sire shall kneel before thy throne.</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>Exalted one! seek what is good,
<lb/>And turn not from the way of understanding.
<lb/>The best of womankind is she through whom
<lb/>A smile is always on her husband's face.
<lb/>If my pure purposes are not conformed
<lb/>To thy command I joy not in thy life.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: <q>Then frame a scheme but tell it
<lb/>To none.</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>O worthy of the throne!
<lb/>I will, with fortune's aid. Not much removed
<lb/>There is a place where festivals are held,
<lb/>For in the forest there my father feasteth.
<lb/>It is a place that men deem fortunate,
<lb/>And thither gather idol-worshippers.
<lb/>Hence to the forest is a score of leagues,
<lb/>And one must weep before the idols there.
<lb/>That is a place for hunting onager,
<lb/>A place too for the worshippers of God.
<lb/>Both king and host will set forth to the feast;
<lb/>He will not leave a soldier in the city.
<lb/>Go then if thou art minded to depart:
<lb/>Let feasts grow old but be thou young forever.
<lb/>Wait for five days, then when the world’s Light shineth,
<lb/>And he shall quit the city, get thee ready
<lb/>To go thyself.</q>
</p>

<p>His wife’s words pleased Bahram,
<lb/>Who slept not till the dawn for thought.
<lb/>Now when
<lb/>The sun displayed its hand upon the sky,
<pb n="133"/>
<lb/>And dark night packed, he mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And rode forth with his weapons to the chase.
<lb/>He told his wife: <q>Make ready and tell none;
<lb/>Let us prepare and set out on our way.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram departed, neared the stream, and saw
<lb/>The baggage of some merchants on the road.
<lb/>They recognised him, and he bit his lip,
<lb/>For they were of Iran—bold travellers
<lb/>O’er sea and land. He bade them offer him
<lb/>No reverence; not even had he told
<lb/>His comrades what he purposed. To the merchants
<lb/>He said: <q>Shut fast your lips; on that depend
<lb/>Our profit and our loss, for if in Hind
<lb/>This secret be divulged the Iranian soil
<lb/>Will be as seas of blood. Enlarged is he
<lb/>Whose lips are shut, the tongue must be confined,
<lb/>And both hands open. By a mighty oath
<lb/>Will I bind fast your tongues till I regain
<lb/>My throne. Say thus then: <q>May we turn away
<lb/>From God, the Holy and Supreme, and follow
<lb/>The Div if ever we desert the counsel
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram and contemplate ill-doing.</q></q>
<lb/>When this oath had been taken and confirmed,
<lb/>So that the Shah’s heart was relieved from care,
<lb/>He said: <q>Guard well my secret, tendering it
<lb/>Like life itself, if ye desire to turn
<lb/>My bondage to a crown; but if the throne
<lb/>Be void of me armed hosts will come from all sides,
<lb/>And leave no merchants here, no Shah, no thane,
<lb/>No host, no throne, no crown.</q>
<lb/>When they perceived
<lb/>The import of his words they came with cheeks
<lb/>All wet with weeping. <q>May the nobles’ lives
<lb/>Thy ransom be,</q> they said, <q>and youth and kingship
<lb/>Thy habit. If the treasure of thy secret
<pb n="134"/>
<lb/>Should be revealed our country would resemble
<lb/>A sea of gore! Who dareth contemplate
<lb/>Such things and turn his wisdom to an ax,
<lb/>His counsel to a hatchet?</q>
</p>

<p>Hearing this,
<lb/>The Shah ’gan praise those honourable men
<lb/>Of Grace and Faith, and fared home ill at ease,
<lb/>Committing to God’s charge his soul and body.
<lb/>He tarried till the banquet-hall was decked,
<lb/>And till the nobles had departed thither,
<lb/>But when Shangul himself prepared to go
<lb/>Bahram’s wife said to him: <q>Barzu is sick,
<lb/>Would be excused, and saith: <q>Be not concerned
<lb/>For me, O king! The banquet-hall to one
<lb/>That aileth is distasteful, and the king
<lb/>Must know thus much.</q></q>
<lb/><q>Let none,</q> Shangul replied,
<lb/><q>That aileth think of banqueting.</q>
</p>

<p>At dawn
<lb/>He left Kannauj and hurried to the place
<lb/>Of feasting. When 'twas night said Shah Bahram:
<lb/><q>Tis time to go, good wife!</q>
<lb/>He seated her
<lb/>Upon her paltry and invoked God’s name
<lb/>O’er her in ancient Persian, donned his mail,
<lb/>And mounted too, his lasso in the straps,
<lb/>And mace in hand. He hurried to the river,
<lb/>And found the merchants sleeping. Rousing them
<lb/>He got a skiff in readiness wherein
<lb/>He seated Sapinud. With day begun
<lb/>They came to land, and brightly shone the sun.
<pb n="135"/>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><head>How Shangul followed Bahram, learned who he was,
and was reconciled to him</head>
<p>
<lb/>A horseman from Kannauj sped with the tidings
<note n="1576"/>Of Shah Bahram’s departure, and Shangul,
<lb/>Who heard it from that loyal servant, quitted
<lb/>The chase as swift as fire. He hurried on
<lb/>Until he reached the river where he saw
<lb/>Both Sapinud and brave Bahram. He grieved,
<lb/>Crossed o’er in dudgeon, and upbraided thus
<lb/>His child: <q>O wicked wanton! thou hast passed,
<lb/>Bold as a lioness, across the river
<lb/>To go Iran-ward with this lusty knave,
<lb/>To desert waste from cultured paradise,
<lb/>Without my knowledge. Now thou shalt behold,
<lb/>Since thou hast left my pillow secretly,
<lb/>The impact of my double-headed dart.</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: <q>O thou of evil mark!
<lb/>Why didst thou urge thy steed as madmen do?
<lb/>Thou hast had testimony that in war
<lb/>I am as with the cup and boon-companions.
<lb/>A hundred thousand men of Hindustan
<lb/>Before me would not equal, as thou knowest,
<lb/>One horseman like me and my thirty comrades,
<lb/>Famed, clad in mail, and wielding Persian swords.
<lb/>I will fulfil the Indians’ eyes with blood,
<lb/>And will not spare a soul.</q>
</p>

<p>Shangul was aware
<lb/>That he had spoken sooth because his prowess
<lb/>And valiancy could not be overlooked,
<lb/>But answered him: <q>I have foregone my children,
<lb/>My kindred, and allies, have held thee dearer
<lb/>Than mine own eyes, and as the diadem
<lb/>Upon my head, and given thee her whom thou
<lb/>Thyself didst choose. The right is on my side,






<pb n="136"/>
<lb/>The wrong on thine. Instead of good faith thou
<lb/>Hast chosen outrage. Ever hast thou heard
<lb/>Of good faith paid thereby? Shall I tell thee:—
<lb/><q>One of my kin and wise in mine esteem
<lb/>Hath gone off cavalierly, gone conceiving
<lb/>Himself a king?</q> What hath a Persian’s heart
<lb/>In common with good faith? He sayeth <q>yea</q>
<lb/>And meaneth <q>nay</q>! Thou’rt such a lion’s whelp,
<lb/>In good sooth, as would bathe in their hearts’ blood
<lb/>Its nurses and, when fanged and sharp of claw,
<lb/>Would purpose combat with its fosterer!</q>
</p>

<p>Bahram made answer: <q>When thou knowest me
<lb/>How shalt thou call me ill in thought and deed?
<lb/>I shall be unreproached for having gone,
<lb/>Thou wilt not term my heart and conduct evil.
<lb/>The king of kings am I both of Iran
<lb/>And of Turan, the leader of the folk,
<lb/>The mainstay of the brave, and will requite
<lb/>Hereafter thy deservings and behead
<lb/>Thy foes, hold thee as father in Iran,
<lb/>And vex thee not with tribute for thy realm.
<lb/>Thy child shall be the Lustre of the West,
<lb/>And Crown of dames.</q>
</p>

<p>Astounded at his words
<lb/>Shangul took off his Indian turban, spurred
<lb/>His steed, and from the front of that great host
<lb/>Approached the Shah to make excuse, embraced
<lb/>The king of kings with joy, and sought to amend
<lb/>What had been said. He was rejoiced to see
<lb/>Bahram, prepared the board, and brought the cup.
<lb/>Bahram revealed the secret to Shangul,
<lb/>Discoursed of the concernments of Iran,
<lb/>And said: <q>Such circumstances and such thoughts
<lb/>Were those that guided me in this affair.</q>
<lb/>They both of them arose, the drinking done,
<lb/>And each asked pardon of the other one.
<pb n="137"/>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><head>How Shangul went back to Hind and Bahram to Iran</head>
<p>
<lb/>These two kings—one a worshipper of God,
<lb/>The other an idolater—joined hands,
<lb/>And pledged themselves: <q>Henceforth we will not sever
<lb/>Our hearts from right, will raze each root of guile,
<lb/>Keep faith for aye, and listen to the words
<lb/>From sages’ lips.</q>
</p>

<p>Shangul too bade farewell
<lb/>To Sapinud, he made his breast the warp
<lb/>And hers the woof. The two kings quickly turned
<lb/>Their backs on one another and flung down
<lb/>The rancour of their hearts upon the dust.
<lb/>One land-ward went, the other river-ward,
<lb/>Apace and glad.
<lb/>When tidings reached Iran:—
<lb/><q>The Shah himself with those escorting him
<lb/>Hath come back from Kannauj,</q> the people all,
<lb/>As they were minded, decked the roads and cities,
<lb/>And everywhere strewed money, musk, and saffron.
<lb/>When Yazdagird received the news he gathered
<lb/>The scattered troops. He and Narsi, the high priest,
<lb/>And all the sages, went to meet the Shah.
<lb/>When Yazdagird beheld his sire Bahram
<lb/>He lighted down and bent him to the dust.
<lb/>Narsi, the monarch’s brother, and withal
<lb/>The high priest had cheeks dust-stained but glad hearts.
<lb/>On such wise Shah Bahram came to his palace,
<lb/>Committing soul and body both to God.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He rested when the world grew dark and while 
<lb/>The moon was like a silvern shield, but when
<lb/>Day rent night’s raiment, and the world’s Light showed,


<pb n="138"/>
<lb/>The king of kings sat on his golden throne,
<lb/>Gave audience but refrained his lips from speech.
<lb/>Came all the nobles with the men of lore,
<lb/>And princes of the empire, then the world-lord
<lb/>Rose on his throne and spake words just and holy,
<lb/>First spake of the Creator, then discharged
<lb/>His debt<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> to wisdom, and thus said: <q>Revere
<lb/>The Almighty in whose ken the manifest
<lb/>And hidden are, Him praise, and unto Him
<lb/>Address thy supplications midst night’s gloom,
<lb/>For he hath given power and victory,
<lb/>And is the Lord of shining sun and moon.
<lb/>All ye that would gain Paradise abstain
<lb/>From evil and foul deeds. Where there is Justice
<lb/>With bounteousness and righteousness the heart
<lb/>Will turn from guile and loss. Let none henceforth
<lb/>Fear me though he possesseth hills of gold,
<lb/>And mines of silver. From your hearts expel
<lb/>All fear and seek addition of all good.
<lb/>The peasant and the thane are one to us
<lb/>When we are judge. When we gave crown and throne
<lb/>To any know that twas from God and fortune.
<lb/>I will strive not to fill my treasury,
<lb/>I would drive not my people from their homes.
<lb/>One treasure only—justice—will I hoard
<lb/>That after death my spirit may rejoice.
<lb/>Thus too, God willing, will my heart grow bright,
<lb/>And fortune smile. Hereby I shall increase
<lb/>Our blessings and direct you to fair fortune.
<lb/>He who hath borne oppression from my troops,
<lb/>Officials, kin, and cavaliers of war,
<lb/>And doth acquaint me not, but keepeth hidden
<lb/>That knavery, is guilty of the crime;
<lb/>Will one so futile ever endeavour greatness?
<pb n="139"/>
<lb/>I call to God for justice on the man
<lb/>That hath concealed the moon behind a cloud;
<lb/>But if your will is other, for men’s motives
<lb/>Are diverse, tell me boldly; haply I
<lb/>May bring to pass your long-conceived desires.
<lb/>Attend to me, do what I bid, and find
<lb/>Your souls’ peace in my counsels.</q>
</p>

<p>Thus he spake,
<lb/>Resumed his seat upon the throne, rejoicing,
<lb/>And set the crown of greatness on his head.
<lb/>The nobles praised him, saying: <q>May the crown
<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> And signet ne’er lack thee. Realm, crown, and throne
<lb/>All glory in a Shah that is both wise,
<lb/>And of victorious fortune, but with thee
<lb/>Thy hardihood, thy knowledge, and thy Grace
<lb/>Are greater than the throne of king of kings.
<lb/>A Shah like thee the world remembereth not
<lb/>For manliness, for treasure, and for justice.
<lb/>To bless thee is incumbent on us all,
<lb/>Both young and old, and we will glorify thee
<lb/>To God and in the presence of our folk.
<lb/>No Shah hath sat upon this throne of gold
<lb/>Like thee in justice, victory, and might.
<lb/>Thou raisest from the dust the dead by justice,
<lb/>By goodly speech, and by munificence.
<lb/>May God almighty be thine aid, and may
<lb/>The head of fortune’s star be in thy lap.</q>
</p>

<p>The mighty men and sages prosperous
<lb/>Went from the monarch’s throne with songs of joy.
<lb/>Then mounting with his troops he drew anear
<lb/>The precincts of Azargashasp. He lavished
<lb/>His gold and jewels on the mendicants,
<lb/>On those especially that hid their want.
<lb/>The high priest of the Fire-fane of Zarduhsht
<lb/>Came muttering prayers with sacred twigs in hand.
<lb/>The Shah brought Sapinud to him, and he
<pb n="140"/>
<lb/>Instructed her in custom, Faith, and rite,
<lb/>In limpid water and the good religion
<lb/>Bathed her and banned from her dust, rust, and soil.<note n="3">la débarrassa de la poussière et de la rouille de l’idolâtrie. <bibl>Mohl</bibl></note>
<lb/>The Shah unlocked the prisons and began
<lb/>Bestowing gifts of drachms on every man.

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><head>How Shangul with seven Kings visited Bahram</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now from his child—the consort of the Shah—
<lb/>Shangul heard of the doings of her spouse,
<lb/>And was desirous to behold Iran—
<lb/>The dwelling of the noble monarch’s daughter.
<lb/>He sent an Indian eloquent and noble
<lb/>As envoy to request the Shah to grant
<lb/>Another treaty to be stored away
<lb/>For record, and the world’s lord had one drawn
<lb/>Like shining Sol in jocund Paradise.
<lb/>The envoy took withal a letter written
<lb/>In ancient Persian by the Shah’s own hand,
<lb/>And went his way.<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> Now when he reached Shangul,
<lb/>And when the monarch of Kannauj had seen
<lb/>Bahram Gur’s letter, he prepared to journey
<lb/>From Hindustan, but hid it from his kindred
<lb/>In Chin. Seven monarchs followed in his train,
<lb/>Escorting Raja Shangul upon his way—
<lb/>The monarch of Kabul, the king of Hind,
<lb/>The king of Sind with troops, the famous king
<milestone unit="calced" n="1580"/>
<lb/>Who ruled Sandal, the monarch of Jandal,
<lb/>A potent prince, the monarch of Kashmir,
<lb/>A man of mastery, and last of all
<lb/>The great and glorious monarch of Multan,
<pb n="141"/>

<lb/>All coveters of honour, all with crowns,
<lb/>All wearing torques and earrings, all with escorts
<lb/>And camp-equipment, all of them renowned,
<lb/>Of high estate and rank, all exquisite
<lb/>With silver, gold, and gems; their parasols
<lb/>Were all of peacocks’ plumes, their elephants
<lb/>Had housings of brocade, their escorts glittered
<lb/>O’er miles with offerings for the Shah and gifts,
<lb/>Such that dinars seemed worthless in his eyes.
<lb/>Thus king Shangul and those seven kings withal
<lb/>Proceeded stage by stage, and, when they neared
<lb/>Iran with all their precious equipage,
<lb/>The Shah, informed of their approach, arrayed
<lb/>A host to go to meet them while the chiefs
<lb/>Of every city went to welcome them.
<lb/>The king of kings in wisdom old, and wary
<lb/>Though young in years, advanced to Nahrawan.
<lb/>The two illustrious and exalted kings
<lb/>Drew near to one another, both of them
<lb/>Alighted from their steeds and, as they met,
<lb/>Both offering greetings and apologies,
<lb/>Embraced. Both retinues alighted too:
<lb/>The world was full of babble. Much talk passed
<lb/>On matters great and small when thus the kings
<lb/>Of these two kingdoms met. They both remounted,
<lb/>As did their worshipful and famous troops.
<lb/>Bahram Gur set him up within his halls
<lb/>A golden throne draped as the custom was,
<lb/>Set wine upon the board and furnished minstrels.
<lb/>The whole place rang with song. He spread a board,
<lb/>An arrow-flight in length, with roasted lambs<note n="2">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 238 and note.</note>
<lb/>And fowls. The eating done, he held a revel
<lb/>In royal wise—all colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The handmaids and the slave-boys stood around,
<lb/>Throne, hall, and palace were like Paradise,

<pb n="142"/>

<lb/>The wine-cups were all crystal, there were chargers
<lb/>All golden, musk, and scents. The revellers
<lb/>Wore jewelled crowns and shoes depict with gems.
<lb/>Shangul was in amazement at the palace,
<lb/>And as he drank he pondered: <q>Is Iran
<lb/>A paradise or garden where one’s friends
<lb/>Exhale the scent of musk?</q>
<lb/>Thus to the Shah
<lb/>Said he in private: <q>Let me see my daughter.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram bade eunuchs of the company
<lb/>Conduct him to that Moon. The noble king
<lb/>Went with them and beheld another palace
<lb/>Like spring. When he beheld her on her throne
<lb/>Of ivory, crowned with an amber crown,
<lb/>He came and kissed her on the head, and laid
<lb/>His cheek to hers and wept exceedingly
<lb/>For love of her as did the Fair o’er him.
<lb/>He stroked her hand and speaking of that hall,
<lb/>That palace, and reception-room, he said:—
<lb/><q>Behold a paradise! Thou hast escaped
<lb/>A wretched palace and a foul abode.</q>
<lb/>The gifts that he had brought with him—the purses,
<lb/>The crowns, and slaves withal, the gems and raiment,
<lb/>Whose value none knew how to estimate,
<lb/>He gave to her. He gave great largess too,
<lb/>And that blithe home was like a garth in spring.
<lb/>Departing thence he went back to the Shah,
<lb/>Disposed for drinking by his happiness.
<lb/>Now when the lords were merry with the wine
<lb/>Shangul departed to his couch to sleep,
<lb/>And, when the Veil of musky hue appeared
<lb/>With stars to spot it like a leopard’s back,
<lb/>The revellers betook them to sweet slumber,
<lb/>While all the attendants stood with folded arms.
<lb/>Thus was it till that golden Cup appeared,
<pb n="143"/>
<lb/>Which thou wouldst call the sun, flung off the cloak
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli, and strewed the waste
<lb/>With topazes; then valiant Shah Bahram
<lb/>Went forth to hunt and took the Indian kings,
<lb/>Went to the chase with cheetahs, hawks, and falcons<note n="3">Cf. p. 76, note.</note>
<lb/>Imperious. For a while they did not irk
<lb/>Their hearts, not one of them felt pain and grief
<lb/>As for a month they hunted on the waste
<lb/>Gazelle and onager. Then they returned
<lb/>With instancy to wine and festival.
<lb/>Thus king Shangul, when hunting and when feasting,
<lb/>Ne’er was long absent from the world-lord’s side,
<lb/>Or at the riding-ground, at merrymake,
<lb/>At banquet and at polo, turned his face
<lb/>For one day from the Shah. A long while passed,
<lb/>The Indian king prepared to journey home.
<lb/>He sought his daughter with a loving heart,
<lb/>And stayed with her a while. He bade a slave-boy
<lb/>Bring pen and paper to him, then he sought
<lb/>For phrases scented with black, pounded musk,
<lb/>And wrote in Indian a righteous rescript,
<lb/>As it were ancient Persian. First he praised
<lb/>Him who had washed the world of its distress,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1582"/>
<lb/>Had spread abroad integrity and right,
<lb/>And flung black lies and loss upon the Div:—
<lb/><q>I serve upon the way of use and Faith,
<lb/>Not that of anger or for vengeance sake.
<lb/>I have bestowed my daughter Sapinud
<lb/>As wife on Shah Bahram, that noble prince.
<lb/>May he live ever as the king of kings,
<lb/>And be the great ones of the world his slaves.
<lb/>As soon as I shall quit this Wayside Inn
<lb/>Let king Bahram become Rai of Kannauj.<note n="4">Cf. p. 140, note.</note>
<lb/>Transgress not the commandment of that king,
<lb/>And carry my dead body to the fire.

<lb/>Give up my treasury to Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And therewithal crown, kingdom, throne, and casque.</q>
<lb/>This deed of gift in Indian characters
<lb/>On silk he gave to Sapinud as hers.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><head>How Shangul returned to Hindustan, and how Bahram
remitted the Property-tax to the Landowners</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul abode for two months in Iran,
<lb/>And then dispatched a noble to the Shah
<lb/>To ask permission to depart, both he
<lb/>And his illustrious counsellors, for home.
<lb/>The king of kings consented that Shangul
<lb/>Should start on his return to Hindustan,
<lb/>And bade an archimage to choose among
<lb/>The treasures of Iran—dinars, gems, silver,
<lb/>Gold, thrones and crowns, swords, girdles and brocade,
<lb/>And stuffs uncut—unbounded, countless gifts
<lb/>To give Shangul while for his suite he furnished,
<lb/>To each in his degree, steeds and brocade
<lb/>Of Chin, dismissed them happy and content,
<lb/>And went three stages with Shangul. Besides
<lb/>The gifts he gave them provand to the coasts
<lb/>Of Hindustan.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When Shah Bahram returned
<lb/>He sat in peace upon the throne, but mused
<lb/>Of death and of ill fortune till his heart
<lb/>Ached and his face grew wan. He bade a scribe—
<lb/>A noble archmage who was his vizir—
<lb/>To come to him and bade him to inspect
<lb/>The treasury and reckon up the gold,
<lb/>The gems, and raiment, for astrologers
<lb/>Had told him, and the words had troubled him:

<pb n="145"/>
<lb/><q>Thy life will last three score of years, the fourth score
<lb/>Will make thee weep at death,</q> and he had said:

<milestone unit="calced" n="1583"/>
<lb/><q>The first score years will I devote to pleasure,
<lb/>Will set joy as a shoot within my soul,
<lb/>And in the next will justify the world
<lb/>By equity and liberality
<lb/>In public and in private. I will leave
<lb/>No corner waste and will provide for all.
<lb/>In the third score I will entreat the Lord;
<lb/>Perchance He will direct me on my way.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The astrologer said sixty years and three,
<lb/>But of the three the reckoning was not clear,
<lb/>And so the Shah desired sufficient treasure
<lb/>To meet the presage of the astrologer,
<lb/>Else would he have not self-reproach and travail?
<lb/>The treasurer went to the treasury,
<lb/>On hearing this, and laboured at the account.
<lb/>He toiled exceedingly till he had told
<lb/>The total to the monarch’s minister,
<lb/>Who thereupon went to the famous Shah,
<lb/>And said: <q>For three and twenty years to come
<lb/>In sooth thou wilt need naught. I have allowed
<lb/>For provand, largess, and thy famed troops’ pay,
<lb/>For envoys that arrive from other kings,
<lb/>And from thine own famed provinces, and thou
<lb/>Possessest for these years a treasury filled
<lb/>With silver, gold, and goods.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Bahram took thought, he was too wise to sorrow
<lb/>Beforehand, and replied: <q>My sway is ending.
<lb/>This world, if thou reflectest, hath three days.
<lb/>Since yesterday is over, and to-morrow
<lb/>Not come, to-day I stoop not under care.
<lb/>As I have means of largess and a throne
<lb/>Of ivory I will have no more tax.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He bade that no tax should be asked thenceforth

<pb n="146"/>
<lb/>From small and great. He set up in each city
<lb/>A man to rouse the drowsy and check strife
<lb/>Wherefrom proceedeth naught save evil deeds.
<lb/>He gave those wise archmages what was needful
<lb/>By way of provand, clothes, and draperies
<lb/>Out of his treasury, and said to them:
<lb/><q>Ye must hide nothing good and bad from me.
<lb/>Be ye the arbitrators of disputes,
<lb/>Make no demands that make yourselves vexatious,
<lb/>Report both good and ill, and cut my fears
<lb/>Concerning evils short.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>This thing obtained
<lb/>Throughout the world, and nothing good and bad
<lb/>Remained concealed. Those sages ordered all,
<lb/>But still from every province letters came,
<lb/>Which said: <q>Through bounty, idleness, and wealth
<lb/>The brains of men are ceasing to be wise.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1584"/>
<lb/>There is such strife and bloodshed in the world
<lb/>That young men set no value on the great;
<lb/>The young men’s hearts are filled with many things,
<lb/>But not with thoughts of Shah and archimage.
<lb/>Their faces they have turned from gain to guile,
<lb/>They have grown troublesome and combative.
<lb/>The peasants, landowners, and unemployed,
<lb/>All give themselves to battle and contention.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When letters of this kind arrived the Shah
<lb/>Was heart-pierced at the bloodshed. In each province
<lb/>He chose officials, wise and understanding
<lb/>As was befitting, and provided them
<lb/>Out of his treasury with food and raiment,
<lb/>The means for largess, and its allocation,
<lb/>And for six months established offices,
<lb/>Requiring of his subjects drachms in payment,
<lb/>And stamping <quote>tax</quote> on silver thus received.
<lb/>The officers wore crowns and had great state.

<pb n="147"/>
<lb/>For six months he received, for six gave back
<lb/>To wretched mendicant and man of birth.
<lb/>He strove in this way to keep men of war
<lb/>From bloodshed and inaugurating ill.
<lb/>Again his agents wrote: <q>Munificence
<lb/>Hath robbed the world of its security,
<lb/>For they that have the money pay no tax,
<lb/>But only meditate more bickerings.
<lb/>Instead of being crass they have grown cruel,
<lb/>They are all troublesome and quarrelsome.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Gur had perused this letter
<lb/>His heart was troubled at such deeds. He bade:
<lb/><q>Treat in accord to God's decree all those
<lb/>That shed blood or employ deceit, that all
<lb/>May find the means of livelihood.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He chose
<lb/>A marchlord full of justice and of knowledge
<lb/>For every province as was fit. He gave them
<lb/>A court-allowance for a year, invoking
<lb/>The Giver of all good. Much time passed by,
<lb/>And then the monarch had a letter sent
<lb/>To those truth-speaking men and correspondents,
<lb/>Whom he had scattered through the world, to ask:
<lb/><q>What is there in the world unprofitable,
<lb/>And bringeth injury upon this realm?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They wrote in answer: <q>Through the monarch’s gifts
<lb/>No man observeth rule and precedent.
<lb/>There is no thought or care for tilth or toil
<lb/>Wherefrom man’s worth deriveth. We behold
<lb/>Draught-oxen straying and the herbage lush
<lb/>In tilth and springing crop.</q>
<lb/>The Shah rejoined:
<lb/><q>Till midday, when the world-illuming sun

<pb n="148"/>
<lb/>Is at its height, the tiller of the soil
<lb/>Must rest not from his work. The other half
<lb/>Is for repose and sleep. If men are fools
<lb/>We can but weep for them. If any lacketh
<milestone unit="calced" n="1585"/>
<lb/>Fruits, seed, and oxen be not stern and harsh
<lb/>Toward him but kind and aid him from my treasures
<lb/>That none may be distressed by indigence.
<lb/>So likewise if the weather causeth loss,
<lb/>And nobody is sovereign o’er the weather,
<lb/>Or locusts anywhere conceal the earth,
<lb/>And eat the herbage to the naked soil,
<lb/>Give compensation from the treasury.
<lb/>Proclaim this edict in the provinces.
<lb/>If there are sterile routes or if the land
<lb/>Be but a waste and all uncultivate,
<lb/>And whether it be owned by rich or poor,
<lb/>From such as I describe demand not aught,
<lb/>And if a man, one of my servitors,
<lb/>Or mine own foster-sire, shall take one mite
<lb/>Him will I bury on the spot alive:
<lb/>God give him neither home nor dwelling-place.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They sealed the letter with the royal ring,
<lb/>And sent the camel-posts a-hurrying.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><head>How Bahram summoned Gypsies from Hindustan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thereafter he sent letters to each archmage,
<lb/>Gave clothing to the mendicants, and asked:
<lb/><q>In all the realm what folk are free from toil,
<lb/>And who are mendicants and destitute?
<lb/>Tell me how things are in the world, and lead
<lb/>My heart upon the pathway toward the light.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>An answer came from all the archimages,
<lb/>From all the nobles, and the men of lore:—
<lb/><q>The face of earth appeareth prosperous,
<lb/>Continuous blessings are in every part,
<pb n="149"/>
<lb/>Save that the poor complain against the ills
<lb/>Of fortune and the Shah. <q>The rich,</q> they say,
<lb/><q>Wear wreaths of roses in their drinking-bouts,
<lb/>And quaff to minstrelsy, but as for us
<lb/>They do not reckon us as men at all.
<lb/>The empty-handed drinketh with no rose
<lb/>Or harp.</q> The king of kings should look to it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah laughed heartily at this report,
<lb/>And sent a camel-post to king Shangul
<lb/>To say thus: <q>O thou monarch good at need!
<lb/>Select ten thousand of the Gypsy-tribe,
<lb/>Both male and female, skilful on the harp,
<lb/>And send them to me. I may gain mine end
<lb/>Through that notorious folk.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the letter
<lb/>Came to Shangul he raised his head in pride
<milestone unit="calced" n="1586"/>
<lb/>Over Saturn’s orbit and made choice of Gypsies,
<lb/>As bidden by the Shah who, when they came,
<lb/>Accorded them an audience and gave each
<lb/>An ox and ass, for he proposed to make
<lb/>The Gypsies husbandmen, while his officials
<lb/>Gave them a thousand asses’ loads of wheat,
<lb/>That they might have the ox and ass for work,
<lb/>Employ the wheat as seed for raising crops,
<lb/>And should besides make music for the poor,
<lb/>And render them the service free of cost.
<lb/>The Gypsies went and ate the wheat and oxen,
<lb/>Then at a year’s end came with pallid cheeks.
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Was it not your task to plough,
<lb/>To sow, and reap? Your asses yet remain,
<lb/>So load them up, prepare your harps, and stretch
<lb/>The silken chords.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And so the Gypsies now,
<lb/>According to Bahram’s just ordinance,
<lb/>Live by their wits; they have for company
<lb/>The dog and wolf, and tramp unceasingly.

<lb/>Thus passed he three score years and three, and had

<lb/>The scribe—the wise archmage, his minister—
<lb/>And said to him: <q>The treasury of the king
<lb/>Of mighty men is void, and I have come
<lb/>For thy command. Those that enjoyed this wealth
<lb/>Expect us not to levy any tax.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The monarch answered: <q>Take no further pains,

<lb/>Resign the world to its Creator—Him
<lb/>Who manifested forth His works. The heavens
<lb/>Will pass away, but God abideth ever

</p>
<p>
<lb/>He slept that night, and early in the morn
<lb/>A countless crowd resorted to his court.
<lb/>They brought together all that were required,
<lb/>And young prince Yazdagird approached the Shah,
<lb/>Who gave him in the presence of the lords
<lb/>The crown and bracelets, torque and ivory throne.
<lb/>Intending to devote himself to God
<lb/>He cast away the crown, he left his seat,
<lb/>And hasted to resign the world’s affairs.
<lb/>At night-fall he was eager for repose,
<lb/>And, when the sun displayed its head above
<lb/>The deep, fear filled his archimage’s heart,
<lb/>Who thought: <q>The Shah ariseth not from sleep

</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1587"/>
<lb/>Then Yazdagird drew near his sire and spied
<lb/>What froze the breath upon his lips—Bahram
<lb/>With faded cheeks lay dead on gold brocade!
<lb/>The day of gloom is as it was of yore,
<lb/>Sear not thy heart with greed and lust of more.
<pb n="151"/>
<lb/>At death the cores of stones and iron quail,

<lb/>Thou shouldst be inoffensive and humane;

<lb/>Oh! never derogate his memory.
<lb/>Of fifty monarchs of seed royal sown,
<lb/>Who girt their loins upon the Iranian throne,
<lb/>Bahram Gur had no like in eminence,
<lb/>In justice, puissance, and excellence.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have called king Rustam but vizir
<lb/>To him though Rustam sent his arrows sheer
<lb/>Through mounts of iron, yet was there no delay
<lb/>When Shah Bahram Gur’s term had passed away.
<lb/>What profit had he from his valour’s day?
<lb/>For forty days the Shah bewailed his sire,
<lb/>The host wore raiment black and blue, and when

<div><head>XXXVI. YAZDAGIRD SON OF BAHRAM GUR: HE REIGNED EIGHTEEN YEARS</head><head>NOTE</head>
<p>
The length of the reign of this Shah (Isdigerd I, A.D. 438-457),
as given by Firdausi, appears to be about correct. From the point
of view of popular tradition he seems wholly to have been over-
shadowed by his famous father, and his reign consequently is all
but a blank in the Shihnama. Historically it was full of incident,
and Firdausi’s statement —
<quote><l>He sent out countless hosts on every side,</l>
<l>And kept the world secure from enemies,</l></quote>


though it may be only a conventional statement, is correct enough.
He began his reign with a war with Rum, This was soon over,
but was followed by long wars with the Huns and the Haitalians.
Within the empire there were persecutions of the Jews and
Christians, and about A.D. 450 serious trouble in Armenia.
Yazdagird, as we have seen,<note n="1">See p. 4.</note> continued his father’s minister, Mihr
Narsi, in power, According to Mas’udi he fortified the passes in
the Caucasus.<note n="2">MM, ii. 193. Cf. Vol. i. pp. 16 and note.</note>
He was known to his subjects by two titles—<quote>The Clement</quote><note n="3">ZT, ii. p. 127.</note>
and <quote> The soldier's friend.</quote><note n="4">RM, I, ii. 363.</note>
</p>

<p>Of the two sons of Yazdagird it is not certain historically which was
the elder, but as Piruz was successful in the struggle for the throne
that followed on the death of his father, he in any case would have
been made out to be the elder in order to regularise the succession,
and the elder he is according to all the Oriental authorities, In
dating his coins he ignored the short reign of his brother Hurmuz.<note n="5">NT, p. 426.</note>

<pb n="154"/>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1588"/>

<p>
<lb/>When Yazdagird became the world’s great king
<lb/>He gathered unto him the scattered troops.
<lb/>There was a conclave of the wise and noble,
<lb/>The great men and the princely archimages.
<lb/>The atheling sat on the golden throne,
<lb/>He shut the door of toil, the hand of evil,
<lb/>And thus began: <q>He that committeth not
<lb/>A wrong is not in danger of the avenger,
<lb/>But when a heart is darkening with envy
<lb/>The Div will be called in to medicine it,
<lb/>For envy causeth greed and grief and want,
<lb/>And is a cruel and revengeful div.
<lb/>Impute not to a foeman’s heart and hand
<lb/>That which displeaseth thee. Humanity
<lb/>Is wisdom’s brother. Wisdom is the crown
<lb/>Upon the head of knowledge. What time thou
<lb/>Conferrest benefits on any one
<lb/>Din it not into him and break his heart.
<lb/>If thou dost good and art longsuffering
<lb/>Thou art not worthless in a wise man’s eyes.
<lb/>If now victorious fortune shall assist me
<lb/>In furthering my wishes in the world
<lb/>I will prepare a roll of righteousness
<lb/>Without an entry of deceit or wrong.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He ruled the world in justice for a while ;
<lb/>The age rejoiced in him and he rejoiced.
<lb/>He sent forth countless hosts on every side,
<lb/>And kept the world secure from enemies.
<lb/>When eighteen years had passed above his head,
<lb/>He grieved because his fortune was bedimmed,
<lb/>Convoked to him the magnates and the sages,
<pb n="155"/>
<lb/>Caused them to kneel before the golden throne,
<lb/>And thus addressed them: <q>This untoward sky,
<lb/>Not knowing fosterling and fosterer,
<lb/>And heeding not the crowns of potentates,
<lb/>Pursueth every quarry in its path ;
<lb/>So now my time is drawing to its close,
<lb/>And all my strength is broken. I bestow
<lb/>The crown, the signet-ring, the host, and all
<lb/>The treasures of Iran upon Hurmuz ;
<lb/>Pay due observance, execute my bidding,
<lb/>And make my will the music of your souls.
<lb/>Although Piruz hath Grace divine and stature,
<lb/>And is the elder brother of Hurmuz ;
<lb/>Yet see I in Hurmuz deliberation,
<lb/>With wisdom, modesty, and aptitude.</q></p>

<p><milestone unit="calced" n="1589"/>
<lb/>He spake and lived a se’nnight afterwards ;
<lb/>Then passed ; the throne wept over him awhile.
<lb/>Be thy years twenty-five, be they five score,
<lb/>Soon will this fleeting show be thine no more,
<lb/>Regard then as a transitory thing
<lb/>Whatever falleth to thy reckoning.
</p>


</div>
</div>
<div><head>XXXVII. HURMUZ: HE REIGNED ONE YEAR</head>
<pb n="156"/>
<div><head>NOTE</head>

<p>
The earliest coins of Piruz date from his third year as he
reckoned it, counting from his father’s death, so the reign of
Hurmuz (Hormisdas, A.D. 457-459) lasted about two years.<note n="1">NT, p. 426. </note>
Hurmuz probably had the advantage of being on the spot at the
time of Yazdayird’s death, but Piruz may have had the better
right to the throne,<note n="2">See p. 153. </note> and seems to have owed much to the services
of a leader named Ruhhaim—a scion of the great Mihran clan
which was of Arsacid descent.<note n="3">NT, pp. 114, 139 and notes.</note>
The name is a familiar one to
students of the Shahnama as that of one of those secondary heroes
many of whom--real personages in the Parthian epoch—have been
reflected back to the mythical periods of the poem.<note n="4">See Vol. iii. p.9.</note>
Ruhham, as
we have seen, was one of the Twelve (eleven) Champions.<note n="5">See Vol.iv. p.102.</note>

Whether Piruz also received formal help from the Haitalians is
doubtful, but plenty of nomad tribes would be willing to take
service with him for a consideration, and if they happened to be
within the Haitalian sphere of influence would be regarded as
Haitilians themselves by tradition. For the consideration required
in the text Tabari substitutes Talikan.<note n="6">NT, p. 116 seq. and notes.</note>
This is much more
probable. Tirmid is mentioned because it would represent the
traditional notion of the Oxus being the boundary between Iran
and Turan. On the other hand settlements in the desert, such as
Tilikin, were valuable both for trade and in war.<note n="7">Id.</note> Firdausi’s
statement that Piruz pardoned Hurmuz is supported by Dinawari
and Mir Khand, but two out of the three accounts in Tabari say
that Hurmuz was put to death. The third says that he was
imprisoned. In all probability he was executed.<note n="8">Id. 117 seq. and notes, RM, I, ii. 364.</note>
</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><head>How Hurmuz, Son of Yazdagird, ascended the Throne</head>
<p><pb n="157"/>
<lb/>Hurmuz succeeded to his father’s throne,
<lb/>And set upon his head the crown of gold,
<lb/>While, thou hadst said, Piruz was all one rage
<lb/>With tears of envy mounting to his eyes.
<lb/>He went incontinent with troops and treasures,
<lb/>And many chiefs, to the Haitalian king,
<lb/>Who was a princeling of Chaghan, a man
<lb/>Of high ambition and possessed of troops,
<lb/>Of treasure, and of power, hight Faghanish.
<lb/>To him Piruz said: <q> O good friend of mine!
<lb/>Two sons were we—the glories of the throne.
<lb/>Our father gave the younger of us twain
<lb/>The royal crown and, having acted thus
<lb/>Unjustly, died. If thou wilt give me troops
<lb/>I have myself wealth, weapons, majesty,
<lb/>And might of hand.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch of Chaghan
<lb/>Replied: <q>Tis well, thy sire was king himself.
<lb/>I will point out the way to get thy rights,
<lb/>And furnish thee with troops upon these terms:
<lb/>That I shall have Tirmid and Wisagird,
<lb/>To which effect I hold a covenant
<lb/>From Yazdagird.</q>
<lb/>Piruz said: <q>Yea, ’tis well,
<lb/>And thou deservest greater sovereignty.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch gave him thirty thousand swordsmen—
<lb/>A noble army of Haitalians—
<lb/>Wherewith Piruz, the Shah, arrayed a host
<lb/>That darkened sky and moon with flying dust.
<lb/>He fought with king Hurmuz who could not long
<lb/>Endure the stress of war but presently
<lb/>Was taken, and his father’s crown and throne
<pb n="158"/>
<lb/>Grew worthless to him. When Piruz beheld
<lb/>His brother’s face he yearned for love and union,
<lb/>Bade him remount and sped to grasp his hand,
<lb/>Dispatched him to the palace and declared
<lb/>His own conditions. Said Hurmuz to him:—
<lb/><q>Thank God that those who worship Him are wise.
<lb/>My brother taketh from me crown and throne;
<lb/>Be victory both in name<note n="1">Piruz means victorious.</note> and deed his own.</q>

</div>
</div>
<div><head>XXXVIII. PIRUZ: HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS</head><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<pb n="159"/>


<p>Piruz becomes undisputed Shah. His inaugural speech. The
land is troubled by a severe drought which Piruz takes measures to
mitigate. The breaking of the drought. Piruz builds cities and,
in violation of the treaty of Shah Bahram Gur, makes war upon
the Haitalians, is defeated, and killed.</p>
</div>
<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>The reign of Piruz (Perozes, A.D. 459-484) lasted much longer
than eleven years, and seems to have made a deep impression on
the popular mind by reason of its accumulation of mishaps. The
expedition against the Haitalians was preceded by a few months by
a total eclipse of the sun<note n="1">On Saturday, January 14th, A.D. 484. NT, p. 425.</note>—a portent of disaster that well may have
helped to bring about its own fulfilment. Mir Khwand tells us that
this Shah’s sobriquet was <quote>The Valiant.</quote><note n="2">RM, I, i. 368. </note></p>
<p>A relic of Piruz—a cup engraved with a representation of that
Shah engaged in hunting—is said to be still in existence.<note n="3">RSM, p. 329. </note></p>

<p>§1. Drought is common enough in Iran, and the record shows
that this particular one must have been of exceptional severity.
According to Tabari, the relief measures adopted by Piruz to cope
with the emergency were so efficient that only one man perished
through want.<note n="4">NT, pp. 119, 122.</note> Tabari, of course, is merely giving the statements
of his authorities without comment.</p>
<p>§§ 2-4. According to the account in Tabari, Piruz built three
cities—Ram-Piruz (the Piruz-Ram of Firdausi) in the territory of <pb n="160"/>Rai, another called Rishan Piruz, and a third named Shahram-
Piruz (Firdausi's Badan Piruz) in Azarbaijan.<note n="1">NT, p. 123.</note></p>

<p>The tradition given in the Shahnama of the war between Piruz
and the Haitalians is dominated by the memory of the beloved and
popular Bahram Gur. We have seen how that Shah, after his
triumphant campaign against that people, set up a pillar that was
to mark the boundary between them and the Iranians.<note n="2">p. 92.</note>
The presumption in the poem is that the arrangement then made continued
in force till Piruz refused to be bound by it any longer. His refusal
brought death upon himself and disaster on his host. Clearly, this
was a judgment upon him for violating the treaty made by his
grandfather. Naturally, if Piruz had been successful, a different
popular estimate would have been formed upon his conduct, but as
matters turned out, he was manifestly a wrong-doer for having left
his grandsire’s way and he merely got his deserts. Consequently,
on this occasion, right was on the side of the enemy, and for a time,
the tradition becomes almost pro-Haitalian. Between the memory
of a great popular Shah and the occurrence of a great national disaster
practically nothing remained, and the two are linked together as
cause and effect. Historically, as we know from other sources, the
case was very different. Bahram Gur’s son and successor, Yazdagird,
had plenty of trouble with the Haitalians,<note n="3">p. 153.</note>
and so had, it would seem, Piruz himself before the final disaster overtook him. Once,
if not twice, he had been forced to conclude an unfavorable peace
with them, had found himself in their power, and his son, Kubad,
had on one occasion to remain two years in captivity until a heavy
ransom had been paid. If the story of the help given by the
Haitalians to Piruz against his brother, Hurmuz, at the price of the
cession of Talikan be unhistorical, it was probably at one of these
conclusions of peace that the place was ceded.<note n="4">pp. 156, 157, NT, p. 119, note.</note> Popular tradition
may have preferred to represent Tisfun as being yielded to secure
the throne for the rightful heir rather than as the consideration
for a disgraceful treaty later on. Piruz violated his own compact,
not Bahram’s, and perished in consequence. There are three
accounts of the disaster in Tabari. They are in accord in essentials,
and two of them attribute the proximate cause of the overthrow of
Piruz to the trench dug by the Haitalian king whom these accounts
is called Achshunwar or Akhshunwar approximately, but in the
absence of diacritical and vowel points, the precise form is uncertain. According to one account, it was the evil practices of the

<pb n="161"/>

Haitalian king that impelled Piruz to declare war, and four sons
and four brothers perished with him.<note n="1">NT, p. 120.</note> The second, which comes
from Ibn Mukaffa,<note n="2">For whom see Vol. vi. p. 17; NT, p. 121, note.</note> states that there were two campaigns. In the
first of them, Piruz was led astray by a Haitalian chief, who had
had himself purposely mutilated in order to deceive the Shah, and
forced to sue for peace. Subsequently, wounded honor induced
him to tear up the treaty and renew the struggle in spite of the
advice of his counsellors; he perished, and his baggage, women,
money, and papers fell into the hands of the enemy.<note n="3">Id. p. 123 seq.</note>
In the
third account, mention is made of Bahram Gur’s pillar, and Piruz
is said to have had it thrown down and dragged in front of him
by fifty elephants and three hundred men that he might not be
charged with passing it. This account also states that a daughter
of Piruz was among the captives taken by the Haitalians. Their
king put her into his harem, and she had a daughter who afterwards
married her uncle Kubad.<note n="4">Id. p. 128 seq. and notes.</note> There can be no doubt but that a
terrible disaster befell the Iranian arms in this campaign and, as
we shall see presently,<note n="5">p. 171.</note> the memory of it was reflected back upon
the mythical past and the story retold in connection with the
overthrow of a Pishdadian Shah.</p>

<p>
<lb/>Piruz, at ease about Hurmuz and free

<lb/>As well became a Shah that worshipped God,
<lb/>And at the outset thus harangued the chiefs:—
<lb/><q>Ye worshipful and noble lords! I ask

<lb/>Wise and untouched by evil
<lb/>He ruled one year with justice and good counsel.
<lb/>Next year the face of heaven was dry, the water
<lb/>Shrank in the streams till it became like musk.
<lb/>The third and fourth year it was even so,
<lb/>And all men were in misery through the drought;
<lb/>The mouth of heaven became as dry as dust,
<lb/>And river-water was a precious drug;
<lb/>There was no room to stand, such multitudes
<lb/>Of men and beasts lay dead. The king of kings
<lb/>Beheld that portent, took off tax and toll,
<lb/>And in each city where he kept his stores
<lb/>Bestowed them freely on both small and great.
<lb/>A proclamation issued from the court:—
<lb/><q>Distribute, O ye men of name and might!
<lb/>Such grain as ye possess and heap instead
<lb/>Your treasuries with coins struck by Piruz.
<lb/>Whoe’er possesseth hoarded stores of grain,
<lb/>Or sheep or oxen roaming at their will,
<lb/>Let him dispose thereof at his own price,
<lb/>For lives are perishing for lack of food.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He sent another letter in all haste
<lb/>To every officer and potentate:—

<lb/>His life.</q>
<lb/>He ordered folk to quit their homes,
<lb/>And coming plainwards lift their hands in plaint.
<lb/>A cry of bitter weeping and distress,
<lb/>Of pain and consternation rose to heaven;
<lb/>On hill and waste, in desert and in cave,
<lb/>They called on God for mercy. On this wise
<lb/>For seven years both small and great beheld
<lb/>No verdure anywhere. With Farwardin,
<lb/>The eighth year, rose a glorious cloud which rained
<lb/>Pearls on the parched up soil. The scent of musk
<lb/>Rose from the gardens while the hail that fell
<lb/>Lay in the mud like pears within a bowl;
<lb/>The rainbow was resplendent in the sky,
<lb/>The age escaped the ill of evil men,
<lb/>And everywhere the bow was strung again.</p>

<head>How Piruz built the Cities of Piruz-Ram and Badan-Piruz,
and how he went to war with Turan</head>
<p>Now when Piruz had 'scaped that day of stress
<lb/>He sat in peace upon the throne of kingship,<note n="1">The previous section ends here in C.</note>
<lb/>He built himself a city which he bade
<lb/>Call Piruz-Ram, the world hath good thereof,
<lb/>For 'tis the pleasance of the glorious Shahs.
<lb/>He built withal Badan-Piruz, far-famed,
<lb/>A place of peace and joy, now Ardabil,
<lb/>Where Caesar hath of right his boundary.</p>

<pb n="164"/>

<p>Whenas Piruz had prospered all these parts,
<lb/>And made thereby the hearts of wise men glad,
<lb/>He gave a largess to his noble troops,
<lb/>And gat him ready to attack the Turkmans.
<lb/>In that campaign Hurmuz was in the van
<lb/>With troops new-levied; after Shah Piruz
<lb/>Kubad led <note n="1">Reading with P.</note> on the army like a blast;
<lb/>Piruz' pure son was he, wise, and a bough
<lb/>That brought forth fruit. Balash, the younger son,<note n="2">Cf. p. 170.</note>
<lb/>A man of Grace and justice, sat rejoicing
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1592"/>
<lb/>Upon the throne while one of Pars, a man
<lb/>Of high renown called by the king Sarkhan,<note n="3">Sufarai, for whom see pp. 170, 173 seg., 185.</note>
<lb/>Was bidden by Piruz: <q>Abide thou here
<lb/>As upright minister before Balash.</q><note n="4">Couplet omitted.</note></p>

<p>Piruz set forward with his troops, his treasure,
<lb/>And gear of war, to fight with Khishnawaz.
<lb/>Now brave Bahram had marked the boundary
<lb/>By setting up a column on the plain
<lb/>With this inscription by the king of kings:—
<lb/><q>Let not a Turkman or Iranian
<lb/>Transgress this boundary on any wise,
<lb/>Or pass across the river.</q></p>

<p>When Piruz,
<lb/>The lion-queller, reached that spot he saw
<lb/>The mark set by the monarch of Iran,
<lb/>And thus addressed his chiefs: <q>By this same token
<lb/>Will I erect with scimitar and treasure
<lb/>A tower against the Turkmans so that none
<lb/>May suffer from the Haitalians. When 'tis raised
<lb/>On the Tarak, and when their chiefs shall bring
<lb/>The former treaty, I will say: <q>Bahram Gur
<lb/>Did thus by manhood, wisdom, might, and Grace,
<lb/>But I will leave no trace of Khishnawaz,
<lb/>Haitalian or Turkman, high or low.</q></q></p>

<pb n="165"/>

<p>When Khishnawaz, son of the Khan, had heard:—
<lb/><q>The Shah and all his host have crossed Jihun
<lb/>Against the treaty that Bahram Gur made:
<lb/>Fresh war and strife have come upon the land,</q>
<lb/>A veteran scribe was called by his command.</p>

<head>The Letter of Khushnawaz to Piruz</head>
<p>He wrote a letter to the king of earth,
<lb/>With<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> praises of him from the righteous Judge,
<lb/>Then said: <q>Since thou departest from the pact
<lb/>Made by just kings I will not call thee royal.
<lb/>Thine ancestors had acted never so,
<lb/>Those rulers of the world elect and pure.
<lb/>By breaking thus the compact of the Persians,
<lb/>And flinging to the dust the mark of greatness,<note n="2"><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">La marque de la frontière établie par les grands</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit></note>
<lb/>Thou forcest me to break the treaty also,
<lb/>And draw the scimitar in self-defence.</q></p>

<p>He wrote at large and sent too many gifts.
<lb/>A noble cavalier and eloquent
<lb/>Went with the letter which when Shah Piruz
<lb/>Had read he raged against that famous prince,
<lb/>And bade the envoy: <q>Rise and get thee gone,
<lb/>Return to that base man and say to him:
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1593"/>
<lb/>Bahram concluded terms of peace whereby
<lb/>The country was your own to the Tarak,
<lb/>But now thou hast the whole to the Jihun,
<lb/>Hill, dale, and desert, all alike are thine.
<lb/>Behold! I lead a vast, a noble host,
<lb/>And warriors bent on fight, and I will leave not
<lb/>For long on earth the shade of Khishnawaz.</q></p>

<pb n="166"/>

<p>The envoy came like flying dust and told
<lb/>What he had heard. When Khishnawaz had hearkened
<lb/>Thereto, and read what had been writ to him,
<lb/>He called his scattered followers to horse,
<lb/>Led forth the army to the battlefield,
<lb/>And set upon a lance’s point the treaty
<lb/>Accorded to his grandsire by Bahram
<lb/>To this effect: <q>Our frontier is Jihun.</q>
<lb/>He chose a man of mark among the troops—
<lb/>One who was shrewd of heart and eloquent—
<lb/>And said: <q>Approach Piruz with courteous words,
<lb/>Hear his reply, and say: <q>I will confront thee
<lb/>Upon the march with thine own grandsire’s treaty—
<lb/>That man of lofty fortune, thine own guide—
<lb/>Set on a spearhead like a shining sun
<lb/>Before the host that all possessed of wisdom
<lb/>May look upon the patent of the just.
<lb/>I shall be praised while thou wilt be condemned,
<lb/>And called <q>The impious Shah.</q> God and his worshippers,
<lb/>And subjects everywhere, will not approve
<lb/>That any one should seek to do injustice,
<lb/>And break the treaties of the kings of kings.
<lb/>None like to Shah Bahram for equity
<lb/>And manhood e’er set crown upon his head.
<lb/>God is my witness, and it is not well
<lb/>To have to make appeal to Him, that thou
<lb/>Art with injustice seeking war with me
<lb/>In falling thus upon me with thy host.
<lb/>Herein thou wilt be not victorious,
<lb/>And likewise get no fruitage from good fortune.
<lb/>Henceforward I shall send no messengers:
<lb/>God will avail to aid me in this fight.</q></q></p>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy came dust-swift with this dispatch,<note n="1">We have not been told that Khishnawaz wrote one.</note>

<lb/>And to Piruz repeated all these words.
<pb n="167"/>

<lb/>When that haughty Shah had read what Khushnawaz
<lb/>Had written in the letter he was wroth,
<lb/>And said thus to the envoy: <q>One of years
<lb/>And world-experience would speak not like that;
<lb/>But if from Chach thou comest o’er the river
<lb/>My spearheads are prepared to welcome thee.</q>
<lb/>The messenger returned to Khushnawaz,
<lb/>Spake with him privately at large, and said:
<lb/><q>I see not in Piruz a reverence
<lb/>For God; he hath not wisdom for his guide;
<lb/>He careth only for revenge and strife,
<lb/>And walketh not according to God’s will.</q></p>

<p><milestone unit="calced" n="1594"/>
<lb/>When Khushnawaz had heard these words he sought
<lb/>To God for shelter, making supplication,
<lb/>And saying: <q>O Thou Judge that judgest right,
<lb/>And art the Master both of wind and dust!
<lb/>Thou knowest that iniquitous Piruz
<lb/>Is not in prowess better than Bahram.
<lb/>He speaketh words unjust and fain would win
<lb/>Addition by the scimitar. Break Thou
<lb/>His foothold from the earth. Oh! may he have
<lb/>No strength, no wit, no heart!</q>
<lb/>Around his host <note n="1">i.e., where he intended to make his stand.</note>
<lb/>He dug a trench which he made shift to hide;
<lb/><q><lb/>Twas lasso-deep and twenty cubits wide.</q></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Piruz fought with Khushnawaz and was slain</head>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1595"/>

<lb/>Prayed privily before the holy Judge.
<lb/>The drums and trumpets sounded in both hosts,
<lb/>The air was ebon with the armies’ dust,
<lb/>And from them both such showers of arrows rained
<lb/>That blood ran down like water in a stream.
<lb/>Then, like a dust-cloud, Shah Piruz advanced
<lb/>With mace and Roman helm, and as he drew
<lb/>Nearer to Khushnawaz,<note n="1">The sentence thus far has been translated from P.</note>
<lb/>the Turkmans’ chief
<lb/>Retreated, turned his rein, and showed his back.
<lb/>The foeman followed fiercely. Shah Piruz
<lb/>Spurred forward with few followers and fell
<lb/>With others—chiefs and Lions of the day
<lb/>Of battle—in the fosse, such as Hurmuz
<lb/>His brother, glorious Kubad and others—
<lb/>Great men and princes of the royal race—
<lb/>Till seven had fallen headlong, men of name
<lb/>With golden casques. Then Khushnawaz returned
<lb/>Rejoicing to the fosse and lifted thence
<lb/>The living while the throne bewailed their fortune.
<lb/>Now Shah Piruz, that chief of chiefs endowed
<lb/>With Grace and state, had broken head and back,
<lb/>While of the princes, save Kubad, none lived:
<lb/>Thus host and empire went adown the wind.
<lb/>Then Khushnawaz advanced with heart content,
<lb/>And head exalted with his warrior-host,
<lb/>And gave to spoil the baggage and the foe,
<lb/>For right and left were indistinguishable.
<lb/>They made some prisoners and what numbers more
<lb/>Were stretched by arrows on the sombre soil!
<lb/>Tis not for world-lords to be covetous,
<lb/>For hearts that covet are the dark dust’s mate;
<lb/>The never-resting sky ordaineth thus
<lb/>Alike for subjects and for king’s estate,
<lb/>And wringeth its own fosterling, be he
<lb/>A fool or wisdom’s pillar. None can stay


<pb n="169"/>


<lb/>Upon this earth of ours eternally.
<lb/>Make right thy provand: naught is left to say.
<lb/>When Khushnawaz had crossed the fosse his troops
<lb/>Lacked not for wealth. They bound Kubad with fetters
<lb/>Of iron, heedless of his throne and race.
<lb/>When tidings reached the people of Iran
<lb/>About the fosse and how Piruz had fought,
<lb/>A wail of anguish went up from the land
<lb/>For all those princes—men of high degree—
<lb/>And when the tidings had been certified
<lb/>Balash descended from his golden seat,
<lb/>Plucked out his royal locks and strewed sad dust
<lb/>Upon the throne. Within Iran the host,
<lb/>The cities and the women, men, and children,
<lb/>All wailed, all rent the hair and tore the face
<lb/>For grief, talked of the Shah and yearned for him;
<lb/>All sat in dole and woe while great and small
<lb/>Took thought what course to choose and whether they
<lb/>Should quit Iran and see where fell the fray?

<div><head>XXXIX. BALASH: HE REIGNED FIVE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS</head>
<pb n="170"/>

<div><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Balash becomes Shah, Sufarai leads forth a host against the Haitalians to avenge the death of Piruz and defeats them. Terms of peace are arranged, Kubad and the other captives are released, and Sufarai returns with them in triumph to Iran. After some years, Sufarai dethrones Balash and makes Kubad Shah.</p>
<note>Balash (Balas, A.D. 484-488) seems to have been the brother, not the son, of Piruz and the uncle of Kubad.<note n="1">NT, p. 133 note.</note> The name is identical with the more familiar Vologeses, Balash being on the spot and regent at the time of the death of Piruz naturally became Shah. Tabari says that he had to fight for the throne with his brother (really his nephew), Kubad, who fled to the Haitalians. The real struggle, however, appears to have been with Kubad’s brother, Zarih, who was defeated and slain,<note n="2">Id.</note></note>

<p>Piruz having expiated by his own death his violation of the treaty made by his grandfather, Shah Bahram Gur, with the Haitalians, popular tradition is at liberty to resume a patriotic attitude and set forth how Piruz was avenged and Iranian honour vindicated. Unfortunately, the account does not appear in the oldest authorities and seems to be unhistorical. Iran at that time was much oppressed by, if not actually tributary to, the Haitalians.<note n="3">Id. 119 note. That the scene of Sufarai’s victory should be laid at Kashmihan, where Bahram Gur had triumphed, is in itself suspicious. See pp. 89, 90.</note> Sufarai’s triumphant campaign seems to have been invented as a salve to the national honour and, incidentally, as a glorification of

<pb n="171"/>

the great family of Karan to which he belonged. The story of his success appears, as Nöldeke has pointed out, to have been reflected back into mythical times and told in connection with Naudar, the Pishdadian Shah. Certainly, the parallel is very complete. In both cases, the Iranian host is overthrown by a Northern foe; in both the Shah perishes; in both the scene is laid in the same neighbourhood; in both the defeat is avenged by a Kiran, and in both cases the prisoners are rescued.<note n="1">See Vol. i. p. 345 seq., and NIN, p. 9.</note> In Tabari’s account, Sufarai appears as Sukhra.<note n="2">NT, p. 120 note.</note> As a leading Iranian of the time, he may have been instrumental in bringing about a peace with the Haitalians after the death of Piruz, and this perhaps may be regarded as the historical measure of his achievement.<note n="3">Id., and RSM, p. 332.</note></p>

<p>Balash appears to have been somewhat after the type of Yazdagird, son of Shapur, in character,<note n="4">See Vol. vi. p. 371.</note> mild and tolerant, approved by the Christians and hated by the Magi who, it is said, were scandalised at his attempt to introduce the Roman fashion of public baths, which of course involved a profanation of the sacred element. As his treasury was exhausted, he was unable to look to the army for support, and after a reign of four years was dethroned and blinded. According to other accounts, he died a natural death.<note n="5">NT, pp. 133 seq. and notes; RSM, p. 336 and note.</note> Mir Khwand says that he was known as <quote>the beloved.</quote><note n="6">RM, Pt.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><head>How Balash ascended the Throne and harangued the Iranians</head>
<p>Whenas Balash had mourned one month, with dust
Upon his head and lacerated cheeks,
The people and the high priest came to him
With valiant warriors and famous sages.
They spake with him at large by way of counsel
In profitable words, then seated him
Upon the throne of kingship, showering gold
And jewels over him abundantly.
When seated on the throne he said: <q>O chiefs!
Acquire the secrets of the sages’ hearts,</q></p>

<pb n="172"/>

<p><q>And ye shall have advancement at my hands
When my dark counsels brighten. Frustrate not
The purpose of well-doers in the world.
As for the wicked and malicious man,
He shall not partner me, but first will I
Enrich him with advice and, if that faileth,
Crown him with blood. When any subject plaineth
To us ’gainst some one of this loyal host
The heart of the unjust one will I break,
And rase him utterly, both root and branch.
See that ye take no freedoms with your Shah,
And in especial one that is devout,
For he by turns is bane and antidote;
So choose the antidote and leave the bane.
Of all things seek to please the Shah and never
Approach his throne unless with joyful looks.
When he is wroth excuse thyself and bless him,
Just or unjust. Whene’er thou sayest: <q>I
Am wise, and I am mighty in all knowledge,</q>
Know that thou never wast more ignorant,
So be not thine own enemy. If now
Ye shall obey the counsel that I give
By hearkening to my profitable words,
Ye shall receive the treasures of wise Shahs:
I never yet saw knowledge injure any.</q>
The chieftains marvelled at his understanding,
And called down praises on him, while the troops
Spake thus to one another: <q>From this Shah
Will fall a lustre on the throne and crown.
God grant that he escape the evil eye,
And ill befall the persons of his foes.</q>
They went forth from his palace well content,
Committing to God’s care his soul and body.
Their hearts were full of love, their tongues of praise:—
<lb/><q>May such a Shah have endless length of days.</q></p>

<p><pb n="173"/>
<lb/>What time Piruz was going to the war
<lb/>He sought a paladin—a man of counsel
<lb/>And weight—to watch o’er crown and throne, and be
<lb/>A friend to young Balash. Now Sufarai—
<lb/>A man of great estate and good withal—
<lb/>Was fitted for that task, experienced,
<lb/>A native of Shiraz, a general,
<lb/>A man exalted both in heart and head,
<lb/>And likewise marchlord in Zabulistan,
<lb/>Kabulistan, Ghaznin, and Bust. When tidings
<lb/>About Piruz, uncounselled and unguided,
<lb/>Came his eyelashes drenched his cheeks with tears,
<lb/>He rent his raiment of a paladin,
<lb/>The warriors doffed their helmets and sat mourning
<lb/>Through sorrow for the Shah, while Sufarai
<lb/>Exclaimed: <q>How shall Balash, youth that he is,
<lb/>Seek vengeance for Piruz?</q> for well he knew
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1597"/>
<lb/>That that would naught avail and that the throne
<lb/>Of kingship was in evil case. He gathered
<lb/>His scattered soldiers, beat the kettledrums,
<lb/>And dust rose from the plain. There came to him
<lb/>A hundred thousand warlike, vengeful swordsmen.
<lb/>He paid, equipped the host, and joyed the hearts
<lb/>Of all that sought for vengeance. Then he called
<lb/>A sweet-tongued envoy watchful, wise, and shrewd,
<lb/>And, seared and sorry, wan and weeping, wrote
<lb/>A letter of wise counsels, instancing
<lb/>Jamshid and Kai Khusrau and Kai Kobad,
<lb/>Dispatched it to Balash, and said: <q>O Shah!
<lb/>Be not aggrieved at death; it is a grief
<lb/>That all must taste; choose patience and choose fame.
<pb n="174"/>
<lb/>What came from wind returneth with the breath:
<lb/>Some call it justice and some tyranny.
<lb/>Now with the approbation of the king
<lb/>Will I make ready for revenge and strife
<lb/>Because the sun and moon cry out in heaven
<lb/>For vengeance for the blood of Shah Piruz.</q>
<lb/>With that the envoy went upon his way,
<lb/>And Sifarai, all wreakful, for his part
<lb/>Arrayed his army like a pheasant’s plumes,<note n="1">Cf. p. 88, note.</note>
<lb/>
<lb/>And from Zabulistan advanced toward Marv.
<lb/>He chose him out a wary messenger,
<lb/>Who by his words could mollify the heart,
<lb/>And spake on this wise to a scribe: <q>Arise,
<lb/>Because thy pen hath stirring work to do,
<lb/>Indite to Khushnawaz and say: <q>O fool,
<lb/>And knavish doer of the work of divs!
<lb/>Thou art in God’s sight guilty, and thy shirt
<lb/>Shall wail for thee. Whoe’er did deed like thine,
<lb/>Thou faithless one? Thou shalt behold anon
<lb/>The sword of tribulation. Thou hast slain
<lb/>A man without offence—the king of kings,
<lb/>The grandson of the world-lord Shah Bahram—
<lb/>And hast set up a new feud in the world,
<lb/>A feud to be forgotten nevermore.
<lb/>Why, when the din of timbals rose, didst thou
<lb/>Not come and fawn upon him like a dog?
<lb/>Thy grandsire was a poor man of thy tribe,
<lb/>Thy sire was like a slave before Bahram.
<lb/>Lo! I have come to Marv to seek revenge,
<lb/>And I will waste the Haitalians utterly.
<lb/>The captives and whatever booty came
<lb/>Within thy grasp upon that battlefield,
<lb/>I will exact all with the sword of vengeance,
<lb/>And bear to Marv Turan’s dust, suffer not
<lb/>The world to be thy son’s, burn all thy kith
<lb/>And kin, cut off thy head by God’s command,
<lb/>And make thy kingdom like a sea of blood.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1598"/>
<lb/>But this is not revenge; why talk I long?
<lb/>When Khushnawaz, in that he slew Piruz,
<lb/>Shall rot in darksome dust his soul shall plead
<lb/>His cause from Hell.</q></q>
<lb/>The envoy with the letter
<lb/>Of Sufarai went like a mighty lion,
<lb/>Came in an angry mood to Khushnawaz,
<lb/>Appeared before his throne, did reverence,
<lb/>And gave the letter, while the captains present
<lb/>Withdrew. The monarch gave it to a scribe,
<lb/>And said: <q>Read out to me in confidence
<lb/>Both good and ill.</q>
</p>
<p>
The scribe thus answered him:—
<lb/><q>This letter is all arrow, mace, and sword,</q>
<lb/>And sorely grieved was valiant Khushnawaz
<lb/>At that long letter writ by Sufarai,
<lb/>Then set himself without delay to answer
<lb/>The good and ill there written and began:—
<lb/><q>I live in fear of God and fortune’s changes.
<lb/>A worshipper of His would not have broken
<lb/>The compact of the Shahs. I sent Piruz
<lb/>A letter of advice besides the treaty
<lb/>Of that great king, <note n="1">Bahram Gur. See p. 166.</note> but he despised my words,
<lb/>And spurned the old king’s pact. When he assailed me,
<lb/>And put me to a shift, and when the hosts
<lb/>Met face to face, the stars raged at Piruz,
<lb/>And by no will of ours thy Shah was slain.
<lb/>Or e’er he broke the pact of righteous Shahs
<lb/>His youth had not another day of joy;
<lb/>He found <note n="2">Reading with P.</note> no favour in the Maker’s eyes;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Earth took him by the heel.</q> <note n="3"><quote>Foot</quote> in the original.</note>

<lb/>The man that breaketh his forefather’s treaty,
<lb/>And flingeth underfoot the head of right,
<lb/>Is like Piruz upon the battlefield,
<lb/>Pashed in a dusty ditch. So shalt thou be
<lb/>If thou shalt come; my wealth and warriors fail not.</q>
<lb/>Departing with the letter and apace
<lb/>The envoy in a week reached Sufarai,
<lb/>Who read and loosed his tongue in malisons.
<lb/>Then from the plain the people heard the blare
<lb/>Of trumpets and the clash of brazen cymbals,
<lb/>And Sufarai led forth to Kashmihan
<lb/>A host so great that Sol was lost in heaven.
<lb/>Twas thus they crossed the stream—an armament
<lb/>That made itself at home where’er it went.

<lb/>And deserts like white crystal. Both arrays
<lb/>Prepared for strife; each raised the flag of greatness.
</p>
<pb n="177"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then dragons’ livers sundered at the shouting
<lb/>Of valiant warriors while feathered shafts
<lb/>Made air all vultures’ plumes, and earth became
<lb/>A bath of chieftains’ blood. Where’er one gazed
<lb/>Lay heaps of warriors slain. Then Sifarai
<lb/>Charged from the centre with his troops amain,
<lb/>While Khushnawaz on his side with his sword
<lb/>Of vengeance spurred down from his vantage-ground;
<lb/>But when he saw that fortune proved unkind
<lb/>He turned his rein and showed his back, pursued
<lb/>By Sifarai as 'twere a raging blast,
<lb/>Who followed with a head-transfixing spear.
<lb/>He captured many nobles; many more
<lb/>Were slain by arrow and by scimitar.
<lb/>He sped till he reached Kuhandizh and saw
<lb/>No lack of slain and wounded on the way.
<lb/>Then from the ramparts Khushnawaz beheld
<lb/>His troops spread o’er the desert’s hills and dales;
<lb/>The way was strewn with dead and things of price
<lb/>So that the plain was decked out like a garden.
<lb/>The soldiers carried off to Sifarai
<lb/>The harness, lances, coronets of state,
<lb/>The battle-gear, the girdles, steeds, and slaves,
<lb/>And made a heap as high as Mount Alburz.
<lb/>He paid no heed to all that Turkman spoil,
<lb/>But gave the whole in largess to his troops,
<lb/>And thus harangued the host: <q>To-day’s affair
<lb/>Hath prospered for us to our hearts’ content
<lb/>Through fortune’s favour, but what time the sun
<lb/>Shall lift its hand in heaven we must not bide
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1600"/>
<lb/>Inactive on the plain but march like lions
<lb/>Upon yon hold to avenge the king of kings.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His troops agreed and each man spake his mind.
<lb/>Thus fared it with them till in arching heaven
<lb/>The sun’s resplendent diadem appeared,
<lb/>Whereat the tymbals sounded in the camp,

<pb n="178"/>

<lb/>And Sifarai bestrode his steed. An envoy
<lb/>Reached that proud chief from Khushnawaz to say:—
<lb/><q>From battle, strife, and bloodshed naught resulteth
<lb/>But travail and contention. Shall we then,
<lb/>Who are two men of wisdom, young, and brave,
<lb/>Send both our souls to Hell? If thou wilt seek
<lb/>Again the way of wisdom thou shalt learn
<lb/>That all that happened was the work of God.
<lb/>It was not through the blast that Shah Piruz
<lb/>Was slain but rather that the stars foreclosed
<lb/>For him his years and months. He was to blame
<lb/>For breach of pact, for choosing colocynth,
<lb/>And spurning honey. Now what was to be
<lb/>Hath come upon our heads. Blest is the man
<lb/>That walketh not the round of violence.
<lb/>The captives and whatever spoil there was,
<lb/>The gold, the silver, and the uncut gems,
<lb/>The steeds, the weapons, and the crowns and thrones,
<lb/>Left by Piruz when fortune quitted him,
<lb/>Both his own treasures and his troops’ as well,
<lb/>Will I send to the general of the Shah
<lb/>That thou mayst go victorious to Iran,
<lb/>Mayst go back to the monarch of the brave.
<lb/>I will not trespass on Iran; do you,
<lb/>For your part, keep the treaty of Bahram.
<lb/>The king of kings apportioned earth aright:
<lb/>Turan and Chin are ours, Iran is thine.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When Sifarai had heard the embassage
<lb/>He called the soldiers to his tent-enclosure,
<lb/>And in their presence bade the messenger:—
<lb/><q>Repeat before the host the foeman’s words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He came and gave them, keeping nothing back.
<lb/>Then Sifarai addressed his army thus:—
<lb/><q>What in your view should be our policy
<lb/>Herein?</q>
<lb/>The troops replied: <q>Tis thine to bid,

<pb n="179"/>

<lb/>And thine to stipulate the terms of peace.
<lb/>None knoweth better in Iran than thou:
<lb/>Thou art our king, our leader, and our lord.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus to his noble chiefs spake Sifarai:—
<lb/><q>The only policy for us to-day
<lb/>Is this—to seek no more to fight with them.
<lb/>I will lead back the army to Iran
<lb/>With speed, because Kubad, <note n="1">Kaikubad in the original.</note> son of Piruz,
<lb/>One of the royal race, is in their hands
<lb/>With the high priest Ardshir and army-leaders,
<lb/>Both young and old. If we fight Khushnawaz
<lb/>The matter will be long and profitless,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1601"/>
<lb/>And they will slaughter their Iranian captives,
<lb/>Kubad, the world’s heir, and Ardshir. Howbeit,
<lb/>Unless Kubad had been in jeopardy,
<lb/>Ne'er had my heart and brain recalled to mind
<lb/>The high priest; but if evil from the Turkmans
<lb/>Befall Kubad, Iran will be all outcry,
<lb/>And this shame current with our warriors
<lb/>Until the Resurrection. We will give
<lb/>A courteous answer to the messenger,
<lb/>And take fair counsels in the cause of peace.
<lb/>We then perchance may see Kubad again,
<lb/>(God grant that no one else be king of kings!)
<lb/>Ardshir the high priest and the other captives,
<lb/>Both young and old.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His soldiers blessed him, saying:—
<lb/><q>That is the treaty, precedent, and Faith
<lb/>For us.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The paladin then called the envoy,
<lb/>And thus addressed him with a dulcet tongue:—
<lb/><q>It was the act of God—enough! This world
<lb/>Designeth evil and appriseth none.
<lb/>The great men of Iran that have been taken
<lb/>Are these—Kubad and the high priest Ardshir. <note n="2">Reading with P.</note>

<lb/>These with the rest that have their feet in fetters

<lb/>Moreover all the booty in your hands—
<lb/>Dinars and crowns and wealth of every kind—
<lb/>Dispatch in full to me, and let it come
<lb/>In presence of the chieftains of this host.
<lb/>We will not stretch our hands to spoil and slay
<lb/>Because we have no need and worship God.
<lb/>Within ten days we will recross Jihun,
<lb/>And take no warlike step thenceforth. Give ear
<lb/>To that which I have said and tell it all,
<lb/>On thy return, to Khushnawaz.</q>
<lb/>The envoy
<lb/>Returned forthwith to Khushnawaz in triumph,
<lb/>And gave the message. Khushnawaz rejoiced,
<lb/>And instantly released Kubad from bonds
<lb/>With the high priest Ardshir and all the other
<lb/>Iranian prisoners, collected all
<lb/>The booty found upon the day of battle,
<lb/>Besides the throne and crown of Shah Piruz,
<lb/>And what was scattered 'mongst his troops, and sent

<lb/>Now when the soldiers looked upon Kubad
<lb/>They joyed to see him, the high priest Ardshir,
<lb/>And all the other captives young and old.
<lb/>The mighty men came from their tents and all
<lb/>Stretched out their hands to heaven in gratitude
<lb/>That they beheld the king of kings’ own son

<lb/>Forthwith the chief broke up the camp, took horse,

<lb/>And glad and triumphing repassed Jihun
<lb/>With that renowned high priest and with Kubad. <note n="1">See p. 179, note.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When tidings reached the country of Iran
<lb/>About that fortunate and glorious chief,
<lb/>About his war and strife with Khushnawaz,

<pb n="181"/>

<lb/>And all his wonder-working policy:—
<lb/><q>He hath returned glad and victorious

</p>
<p>
<lb/>Such shouts ascended that thou wouldst have said:—
<lb/><q>They deafened those that heard.</q> The prudent magnates
<lb/>arose and got themselves in readiness
<lb/>To go forth with their welcome while Balash
<lb/>Prepared a golden throne to seat Kubad,
<lb/>And that chief paladin. When Sifarai
<lb/>Arrived within the realm the great men all
<lb/>Met, while the Shah prepared the welcoming,
<lb/>Set forward with such forces as he had,
<lb/>And when he saw Kubad released from bonds,
<lb/>Glad and victorious, embraced him quickly
<lb/>With joy and cursed the people of Haital
<lb/>And Chin. They passed within the royal palace
<lb/>With hearts still sore and eager for revenge.
<lb/>Balash commanded and they spread the board,
<lb/>And called for wine and harp and minstrelsy;
<lb/>But there was little gladness at that feast
<lb/>Through sorrow for magnanimous Piruz.
<lb/>The singers lauded Sifarai and sang
<lb/>Upon the harp the war against Turan.
<lb/>He was the Cynosure of all the chieftains,
<lb/>Who entertained high hopes and joyed in him.
<lb/>The country rallied to him, those at least

<lb/>Naught happened but according to his will,

<lb/>Kubad is wiser far than thou and hath

</p>
<p>
<lb/>Balash withdrew to his own house, for he

<div><head>XL. KUBAD SON OF PIRUZ: HE REIGNED FORTY-THREE YEARS</head>
<pb n="183"/>

<div><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>
Kubad ascends the throne and harangues the chiefs, Sifarai
continues for a time at the head of affairs and then is disgraced and
executed. The Iranians revolt in consequence, hand Kubad over
to Sifarai’s son, Rizmihr, and make Kubad’s brother, Jamasp,
Shah. Rizmihr acts with extreme loyalty, protects Kubad, and
escapes with him to the Haitalians. On the way thither Kubad
marries a thane’s daughter who becomes the mother of Kisra.
Provided with an army by the king of the Haitalians, Kubad
regains the throne. He wars against Rum, builds cities, and becomes
a convert to the teaching of Mazdak who, however, is
worsted in a public disputation by Kisra and put to death with his
followers. Kubad appoints Kisra, to whom the folk give the name of Nushirwan, his successor and dies.
</p>
</div>

<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>
According to Mir Khwand, Kubad (Kobad, A.D. 488-531) was known as <quote>the well-intentioned.</quote> 
<note n="1">RM, Pt. L, Vol. ii. p. 371. The nickname may be illustrated by the following story from the Persian Tabari. Kubad was engaged once in hunting at vintage-time and reached a village where he saw a very beautiful vine. Near by was a woman, engaged in baking bread, who had with her a child some three years old. Suddenly the child entered the garden where the vine was, picked a bunch of grapes, and was about to eat them. The woman slapped the child, took away the bunch, and refastened it to the vine. Kubad, astounded at her parsimony, approached the vine and asked the woman whose it was. She answered that it belonged to her. He then inquired whose the child was, and she told him that it was hers. Then he said: <q>Why have you taken the bunch of grapes away from it, beaten it, and refused to your own child a paltry bunch.</q> She replied: <q>We are not free to dispose of our own, for the Shah has a share, and before someone comes on his behalf to deduct his portion we dare not put hand to it.</q> Kubad said: <q>Do you only or do all folk act thus?</q> She answered: <q>Not I alone, but all in the realm of Kubad.</q> The Shah was full of pity for his subjects, narrated the story to his ministers, and bade them find a less oppressive way of raising revenue. They recommended that the whole realm should be surveyed and taxed in proportion to its fertility, remoteness, and distance from water. Then the revenue would be in money which could be demanded at any time. The Shah gave orders accordingly, and the work was begun, but finding that it could not be completed in his own lifetime he charged his son and destined successor, Nushirwan, to see that it was carried through, which he did (p. 224 seq.). —ZT, ii. 152 seq.</note>
</p>
<p>
Historically the events of his reign, as set forth in the Shahnama, may be revised as follows, Sifarai remained at the head of affairs until the revolt occurred that drove the Shah to take refuge with the Haitalians. This revolt was brought about by the conversion of Kubad to the doctrines of the heresiarch Mazdak, who had a large and increasing following. Kubad seems to have been sincere in his adoption of Mazdakism, but at the same time used its subversive principles as a means of reducing the power of, and of humbling, the great nobles. The official hierarchy, however, took alarm, Kubad was dethroned and shut up in the <quote>Castle of Oblivion</quote> in Susiana, and Jamasp, his brother, reigned in his stead. Kubad, however, by the help of his sister, wife, or both, or of Sifarai himself, managed to make good his escape to the Haitalians with whom he had stayed for some two years as a hostage during the lifetime of his father.<note n="2">See p. 160.</note>
</p>
<pb n="184"/>
<p>
During his second sojourn among them he married his own niece—the offspring, by the Haitalian king, of the captive daughter of Piruz. <note n="2">Id. p. 161.</note> Helped by his royal father-in-law, Kubad managed to recover his throne and placed Sifarai again at the head of affairs, but at length, finding him too powerful, called in the aid of his rival—Shapur of Rai, the captain of the host—and had him put to death. Kubad never seems to have abandoned his personal regard for Mazdakism, in spite of the fact that it had cost him the temporary loss of his crown, until nearly the end of his long reign. Probably after his restoration, he was content to hold it as a pious opinion only, no longer as a weapon to be used against the nobility or in a manner provocative of the Magi. The Mazdakites, however, not unnaturally became concerned about the future—what would happen on Kubad’s death? Accordingly, they attempted to secure the succession for one of Kubad’s sons whom they knew that they could trust. Kubad, however, had made up his mind already in favor of another heir, and a great massacre of Mazdakites ensued. This seems to have taken place at the end of A.D. 528 or the beginning of A.D. 529. Kisra, in consequence of the share that he took in exterminating the Communists, received the name of Nushirwan. <note n="1">MM, ii. 196. Cf. p. 211 and note.</note>
</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p>
This account, from which all irrelevant history has been omitted, differs widely, as will be seen, from that given in the Shahnama: Mazdak and his evangel have been replaced in their proper historical context, the story of the birth of Kisra has been omitted, and so has all reference to Rizmihr, Sifarai’s son.
</p>
<p>
§§ 2 and 3. Tabari tells us that when, at the instance of Kubad, Shapur of Rai overthrew Sukhra (Sifarai), a saying, which became a proverb, grew current and ran thus: <q>Sukhra’s wind is gone; now a wind has risen for Mihran.</q> Mihran was the name of one of the great Arsacid families that played an important role, and held high office, in Sasanian times, and its employment in the above proverb has led Nöldeke to suspect that <foreign>Sukhra</foreign> also must be the title of a family, not the name of an individual, as otherwise the two halves of the proverb would not have balanced properly. He is inclined therefore to the opinion that Sukhra and Zarmihr—the Rizmihr of Firdausi—were not two individuals standing in the relation of father and son to each other, but one and the same person—Zarmihr of the family of Sukhra of the house of Karan. <note n="2">NT, pp. 120 note, 140 and note.</note> This house, like that of Mihran, was probably of Arsacid descent, but in Iranian tradition, as we learn from the Shahnama, claimed a much older origin and looked upon Kawa, the smith, who raised the standard of revolt against the tyranny of Zahhak, as the founder of its fortunes. <note n="3">See Vol. i. p. 154 seq.</note> However, this may be, the rivalry between two great families, and the employment by the Shah of one of them to deliver himself from the overgrown authority of the other would be natural enough. It is to be noted that Shapur of Rai is described in the poem as being descended from Mihrak—the mortal enemy of Ardshir Papakan and evidently for some reason or other a very important personage in Iranian legend. He is said to have been of Jahrom in Pars, while Rai, with which his descendant Shapur is associated, was the center of Arsacid power in popular tradition. <note n="4">Vol. vi. pp. 201, 237, 241, 256, 266 seq.</note>
</p>
<p>
Not very long ago we had a Mihran as treasurer to Yazdagird son of Shapur, <note n="1">Id. p. 387.</note> quite lately we found another—Ruhham—helping Piruz in his struggle against his brother Hurmuz, <note n="2">p. 156.</note> presently we shall come upon a third as the opponent of Belisarius, <note n="3">p. 187.</note> a fourth as a general in Nushirwan’s host, <note n="4">p. 251. Cf. NT, p. 139 note.</note> while a fifth—Mihran Siyad—goes on a mission to the Khan. <note n="5">p. 350.</note>
</p>
<pb n="186"/>
<p>
In Kubad’s plans for escape to the Haitalians, he associates himself with six others. Seven is a favorite number in Persian story. We have the Seven Climes, the Seven Courses or Stages of Rustam and Asfandiyar, the Fight of the Seven Warriors, the Seven Feasts of Nushirwan, and other instances. <note n="6">See Vol. vi. p. 207.</note>
</p>
<p>
According to Tabari, Kubad fled twice to the Haitalians, once on the occasion of his unhistorical contention with Balash <note n="7">p. 170.</note> and again, historically, here. On both occasions, he is said to have contracted a marriage on his journey and to have been accompanied by Zarmihr (Rizmihr). This is stated by Tabari with regard to the first flight and by Dinawari and Firdausi as to the second. <note n="8">NT, pp. 135, 145 and note.</note>
</p>
<p>§5. In the above accounts, the birth of Kisri is chronicled in connection with both flights. This duplication does not make the story any more probable, and, as a matter of fact, Kisra appears to have been the son of the sister of one of Kubad’s generals who served in the Roman war, A.D. 502-506. <note n="9">Id. and cf. p. 187.</note> In view of the subsequent importance of Kisra, it was incumbent that Kubad should ask and receive satisfactory assurances as to the descent of the mother of his son. The name Kisra is the Arabic form of the Persian Khusrau, which, with the exception of twelve years, was the name of the Shahs from A.D. 531 to A.D. 627, if we leave out of account the usurper Bahram Chubina.</p>
<p>Jamasp, who, according to Mir Khwand, was known as <quote>the proud,</quote> <note n="10">RM, Pt. I, Vol. ii. p. 371.</note> appears to have reigned for two years, A.D. 496-498, and it is to be feared that his brother’s treatment of him after his deposition was not so amiable as Firdausi would have us believe. The same remark would apply to Jamasp’s adherents, whom also the poet tells us were pardoned. One account at all events states that Kubad <quote>killed the Great</quote> when he regained the throne. <note n="11">NT, p. 461 and note.</note></p>
<p>According to Tabari, Zarmihr (Rizmihr) was put to death by Kubad some time after his restoration. <note n="12">Id. p. 142.</note> The story of the Shah’s ingratitude to the father is duplicated in the case of the son, which in itself is suspicious, as is the almost superhuman loyalty displayed by the latter in § 3. It may be laid to the account of the legitimist view that obtains in this part of the poem. If Sufarai be the Persian commander-in-chief called Seoses in Procopius, he was not put to death till about A.D. 519. <note n="2">NT, p. 145 note.</note></p>
<pb n="187"/>
<p>Until war broke out in A.D. 502, there had been, with one slight exception in the reign of Yazdagird son of Bahram Gur, a period of peace for eighty years between the Persian and Eastern Roman Empires. To both, the defense of the passes in the Caucasus against the incursions of northern Barbarians was equally important, and the understanding was that both should contribute equally to that end. This arrangement formed one of the terms of the peace concluded by Yazdagird with the younger Theodosius after the brief war, above mentioned, in A.D. 442. The Romans, however, were very remiss in carrying out their part of the undertaking, and their money contribution was in arrear. Both parties seem to have been inclined to look upon the money as tribute to be exacted or refused according to circumstances, and this added to the difficulty of an agreement which probably is responsible for the notion often found in Iranian legend that Rum was tributary to Iran. Kubad, after his restoration, found himself in want of money to pay his Haitalian allies and applied to Emperor Anastasius for the arrears due for the defense of the passes. Anastasius refused, his motive being, it is said, the hope of embroiling Kubad with his northern mercenaries, and the Shah declared war. At first, he was very successful, taking Theodosiopolis in Roman Armenia and Amida in northern Mesopotamia, but the generals whom he left to carry on the war, when he himself was called off to resist an Haitalian invasion, were less successful, and Kubad commissioned his brother-in-law, the uncle of Kisra, to negotiate a peace. The Persians received a lump sum and gave up the captured cities. Towards the end of Kubad’s reign, war again broke out, A.D. 526, and lasted till his death. It was in this war that Belisarius rose to fame and fought twice with one of the Mihrans named Piruz. <note n="5">Cf. p. 186.</note></p>
<p>Procopius, who had become secretary to Belisarius in A.D. 527, gives a correspondence purporting to have passed between the two generals. <note n="6">RSM, p. 368 seq. and note.</note></p>
<p>
Hulwan was situated northwest of Kirmanshah at Sar-i-pul-i-Zohab. <note n="7">Id. 564 note; NT, p. 138 and note.</note> Kubad merely renamed it as he also renamed a town

called Arjan on the borders of Ahvaz and Pars not far from the present Behbahan. He changed Arjan to Ramkubad. <note n="1">Id. 13 and note, 146.</note>
</p>
<p>
§§ 6 and 7. In the Vendidad there is a reference to "the ungodly fasting Ashemaogha" (heretic), to which the Pahlavi commentary on the Zand-Avesta adds: <q>like Mazdak, son of Bamdad.</q> <note n="2">DZA, i. 48 and note.</note> In the late Pahlavi Text known as the Bahman Yasht, the names are given of six priests whom Nushirwan summoned to his aid in his disputation with Mazdak. <note n="3">WPT, i. 194.</note> Two of them are recognizable in Firdausi's Hurmuzd and Mihr-Azar. Mazdak’s place of birth is quite uncertain, and his historical importance began and ended with the reign of Kubad. The poet omits to mention two of Mazdak’s principles—the prohibition of bloodshed and of flesh-eating—but in other respects, his account of that heresiarch’s doctrines seems to be substantially correct—Zoroastrianism with private property and the family abolished. To this anarchical Faith, doubtlessly he did his best to win over Kubad’s recognized heir, failing in which he schemed to alter the succession and perished in the attempt. This seems to be the obvious explanation of the catastrophe. Mani and his followers in their time fared no better. <note n="4">See Vol. vi. p. 359; NT, 465.</note> Nushirwan was far too able and practical to be led away by Mazdak, and on coming to the throne tried his best to repair the mischief that had been done. <note n="5">NT, p. 163. For Mazdak and the Mazdakites generally see id. p. 455 seq.</note>

<lb/>While Sifarai took order for the world.
<lb/>Kubad ruled in the palace; all affairs
<lb/>Were managed wholly by the paladin.
<lb/>He suffered no one to approach the Shah,
<lb/>Who had no archmage and gave no command
<lb/>Or counsel. Sifarai ruled all the land.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How Sifarai went to Shiraz, how the Iranians slandered him to Kubad, and how Kubad slew him</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1603"/>
<p>
<lb/>Thus in the cup the wine was tulip-like
<lb/>Until Kubad was twenty-one <note n="1">Reading with P.</note> years old;
<lb/>Then Sifarai came in before the king
<lb/>For licence to go home and thereupon
<lb/>He got him ready with his retinue,
<lb/>Struck up the drums, and started for Shiraz,
<lb/>Returning to his country, full of joy,
<lb/>As one that had obtained his whole desire.
<lb/>All Pars was as it were a slave before him,
<lb/>And, save the throne of empire, all was his.
<lb/>His thoughts were these: <q>I have set up the Shah,
<lb/>And done him homage as my sovereign,
<lb/>So now if any man shall slander me
<lb/>He will rebuke that man and banish him.</q>
</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>
<lb/>He levied tribute on the provinces,
<lb/>On all the men of name and all the chiefs.
<lb/>When tidings of his just and unjust deeds
<lb/>came from Shiraz to glorious Kubad,
<lb/>The people said: <q>The Shah hath but the crown,
<lb/>And not the troops and treasure in Iran,
<lb/>Hath no authority, is not consulted;
<lb/>The world is all the slave of Sifarai.</q>
<lb/>All those that shared the secrets of Kubad
<lb/>Repeated to him what the people said,
<lb/>And added: <q>Why, exalted king! art thou
<lb/>Contented merely to be king in name?
<lb/>His treasury is better filled than thine:
<lb/>Thou shouldst release the world from his oppression.
<lb/>All Pars hath grown as ’twere a slave to him,
<lb/>The great men have become his thralls.</q>
</p>
<pb n="191"/>
<p>
<lb/>These words
<lb/>Seduced Kubad’s <note n="1">See p. 179, note.</note> heart, which became forgetful
<lb/>Of all the services of Sifarai;
<lb/>He said: <q>If I shall send an army forth
<lb/>He will revolt and seek to be avenged,
<lb/>I shall but use my wealth to make a foe,
<lb/>While he will cause much trouble and much toil.
<lb/>The people all are talking of his deeds,
<lb/>Unwitting of his secret purposes.
<lb/>I know not any warrior of Iran
<lb/>To march against him with a host to battle.</q>
<lb/>A wise man answered thus: <q>Think not that he
<lb/>Ever will be recognised as king. Thou hast
<milestone unit="calced" n="1605"/>
<lb/>Both lieges and a leader of the host
<lb/>That can lay hand upon the circling sky;
<lb/>So when Shapur of Rai is on the march
<lb/>The heart of wicked Sifarai will rive.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah took courage when he heard these words,
<lb/>Forgot the merit and presumed the guilt;
<lb/>Then bade a veteran mount as swift as wind,
<lb/>And, on the plea of faring forth to hawk,
<lb/>Go to Shapur of Rai, cause him to mount
<lb/>Forthwith upon his steed, and summon him

<pb n="192"/>

<lb/>From Rai to court. The messenger, who took
<lb/>A spare steed, went swift as an autumn-blast
<lb/>To Rai as he was bidden by the king. 
<lb/>The chamberlain there saw and questioned him,
<lb/>Took the king’s letter, went before Shapur,
<lb/>Gave it, and introduced that noble horseman.
<lb/>Shapur, who was descended from Mihrak,
<lb/>Smiled when he read the letter of Kubad, <note n="1">Id.</note>
<lb/>
<lb/>For Sifarai had not a foe like him
<lb/>In public and in private. Thus apprised
<lb/>Shapur convoked his lieges and led forth
<lb/>His army in all haste to Taisafun.
<lb/>When he had brought his army to the Shah
<lb/>They gave him audience instantly. The world-lord,
<lb/>On seeing him, received him graciously,
<lb/>Caused him to sit upon the turquoise throne,
<lb/>And said: <q>I have no portion in this crown,
<lb/>Am noted 'mongst the foolish in the world.
<lb/>All power is with Sifarai; I see
<lb/>But sovereignty in name. Late in the day
<lb/>My body shrinketh from the weights that press
<lb/>With justice or injustice on my neck.
<lb/>E’en were my brother master of Iran
<lb/>'Twere better than this unjust Sifarai.</q>
</p>
<pb n="193"/>
<p>
<lb/>Shapur replied: <q>O king! be not aggrieved
<lb/>At heart on this account. Thou shouldest write
<lb/>A letter in harsh terms to him, for thou
<lb/>Hast Grace and fame, high lineage and support.
<lb/>Say: <q>Of the crown of king of kings my share
<lb/>Is travail and an empty treasure-house.
<lb/>Thou takest tribute, and I bear the blame.
<lb/>I will not have thee call me Shah henceforth.
<lb/>Lo! I have sent to thee a paladin
<lb/>In that thy conduct causeth me to wail.</q>
<lb/>When he shall get a letter thus conceived,
<lb/>And I am there with troops prepared for fight,
<lb/>I will not leave him time to wink an eye,
<lb/>Or speak a word to him unless in wrath.</q>
<lb/>They called to them a scribe and seated him
<lb/>Before Shapur, who said again the words
<lb/>As spoken in the presence of the Shah:
<lb/>The writer wrote them, grieving secretly.
<lb/>Shapur, whenas the Shah had sealed the letter,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1606"/>
<lb/>Led forth his host, then added famous chiefs,
<lb/>Disbanded from the armies of the king,
<lb/>And with those nobles eager for the fray
<lb/>Set face toward the city of Shiraz.

<lb/>When Sifarai had tidings of the matter
<lb/>He marched at once, and with a mighty host—
<lb/>Picked cavaliers in mail—went out to meet
<lb/>Shapur. They met, and those two haughty chiefs
<lb/>Alighted from their steeds. Now when Shapur
<lb/>Sat down with Sifarai they talked at large
<lb/>Of projects good and ill. Shapur then gave
<lb/>The letter of the king, and matters reached
<lb/>A cruel, shameful pass; the paladin,
<lb/>When he had read the letter, changed his favor,
<lb/>Was stunned and dark of soul. Then said Shapur,
<lb/>The letter being read: <q>I must be plain:
<lb/>The world-lord ordered that thou shouldst be bound,
<lb/>Complaining much of thee before the nobles,
<lb/>And thou wilt gather, having read his letter,
<lb/>That he is resolute.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The paladin
<lb/>Replied: <q>The monarch of the world is aware
<lb/>What toil and hardship I have borne for him,
<lb/>That marching from Zabulistan with troops
<lb/>I set him free from bondage by my valour,
<lb/>And suffered no calamity to come
<lb/>Upon him. I had influence with the Shah,
<lb/>And with the chieftains of the Iranian host,
<lb/>But since bonds are to be my recompense,
<lb/>And my resistance will be troublesome
<lb/>To thee, I ask no respite. Bind my feet:
<lb/>The fetters of Kubad will profit me.
<lb/>Doth he not shame before God and the host,
<lb/>For I shed freely my warm blood for him?
<lb/>What time the Shah was in captivity
<lb/>I swore by God a mighty oath, and said:—
<lb/><q>My hand shall look but on my falchion’s hilt,
<lb/>And I will cloud the sun in fight, till I
<lb/>Shall give my head or bring down from the throne
<lb/>The head of Khushnawaz between the shears.</q>
<lb/>And now he biddeth me be bound! Is’t right?
<lb/>Receive I but derogatory words?
<lb/>Still turn not aught from his commands, for know
<lb/>That bonds but ornament a hero’s feet.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Shapur, on hearing this, made fast the fetters,
<lb/>Then bade the trumpet sound and got to horse.
<lb/>From Pars he carried Sifarai before
<lb/>Kubad, who thought not of past services,
<lb/>But bade men bear him to the prison-house,
<lb/>Near where the madmen were, and gave command
<lb/>To carry from Shiraz to Taisafun
<lb/>What wealth soever he possessed—his folk,
<lb/>His treasures, and the produce of his fields—
<lb/>By those appointed to the treasurer.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1607"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when a week had passed Kubad consulted
<lb/>The archmages how to deal with Sifarai,
<lb/>And thus a counsellor addressed the Shah:—
<lb/><q>The whole of Taisafun is on his side—
<lb/>Troops, courtiers, thanes, and populace alike.
<lb/>If he abideth in Iran unscathed
<lb/>Thou mayest wash thy hands of sovereignty.
<lb/>The foe of the Shah is best when killed,
<lb/>His hater’s fortune best when overturned.</q>
</p>
<pb n="195"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the Shah had heard the archmage’s counsel
<lb/>He took a new course and despised the old,
<lb/>Gave his command that Sifarai be slain,
<lb/>The hearts of all his kindred wrung with pain.
</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How the Iranians put Kubad in Bonds and committed him to
Rizmihr, the Son of Sifarai, and how Jamasp, the Brother
of Kubad, was set upon the Throne</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when these tidings reached the Iranians:—
<lb/><q>He of the elephantine form is dead,</q>
<lb/>A cry of anguish went up from Iran,
<lb/>Men, women, children, all alike bewailed;
<lb/>The tongue of every one was steeped in curses,
<lb/>And secret thoughts found public utterance.
<lb/>Iran was all convulsed, the dust went up,
<lb/>While all folk made them ready for the fight,
<lb/>And thus they said: <q>Since Sifarai is gone
<lb/>Let not Kubad’s throne be within Iran.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The soldiers and the citizens agreed,
<lb/>They would not bear the mention of Kubad,
<lb/>But marched upon the palace of the Shah,
<lb/>Vexed at his ill advisers, for redress.
<lb/>These men—all malice and intent on evil—
<lb/>They took, dragged from the palace, and then sought
<lb/>With diligence for traces of Jamasp,
<lb/>His younger brother and a noble youth,
<lb/>One whom Kubad had cherished tenderly.
<lb/>They chose him, seated him upon the throne,
<lb/>And called down blessings on him as their Shah;
<lb/>But made Kubad’s feet fast in iron fetters,
<lb/>Unheedful of his Grace and noble birth.
</p>
<pb n="196"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now Sifarai had one son well beloved,
<lb/>A wise man, holy and illustrious,
<lb/>A youth without offence, Rizmihr by name,
<lb/>Whose fame had made his father well content.
<lb/>To him the people gave Kubad in bonds,
<lb/>As unto some malicious enemy,
<lb/>And thought: <q>Through grief the loving son will take
<lb/>Revenge upon the king for Sifarai.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good Rizmihr, the worshipper of God,
<lb/>Laid not his hand for ill upon the world-lord, <note n="1">Cf. p. 187.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1608"/>
<lb/>But did obeisance to Kubad and spake
<lb/>No words to him about his evil deeds,
<lb/>Whereat the world-lord marvelled much, began
<lb/>To bless Rizmihr, and thus excused himself:—
<lb/><q>My foes have troubled much my star and moon,
<lb/>But, if I find deliverance from bond,
<lb/>I will reward thee for all ills endured,
<lb/>For I will banish anguish from thy heart,
<lb/>And cause the eyes that look on thee to shine.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Rizmihr made answer to him thus: <q>O king!
<lb/>Let not thy soul be grieved on this account,
<lb/>For when a father acted not aright
<lb/>His son should bear the sorrow of his death.
<lb/>As touching mine own self, I am thy slave;
<lb/>I stand before thee as a servitor,
<lb/>And at thy bidding I will swear that never
<lb/>Will I break off my fealty to thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>So spake Rizmihr and as the monarch heard
<lb/>His heart began to throb for very joy,
<lb/>His soul regained its confidence and grew
<lb/>Right joyful at the words of that wise man.
<lb/>He made Rizmihr his confidant and said:—
<lb/><q>I will not hide my thoughts from thee. Five men
<lb/>Are sharers in my secrets. None besides
<lb/>Hath listened to my voice. Now we will summon

<pb n="197"/>

<lb/>These five and ope to them our secret plan
<lb/>If it appears that we have need of them,
<lb/>While if from fetters thou shalt set me free
<lb/>Know this—my policy shall profit thee.</q>
</p>


</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Kubad escaped from Ward with Rizmihr, how he wedded
the Daughter of a Thane, and how he took Refuge with the
Haitalians</head>
<p>
<lb/>The good Rizmihr, on hearing this, anon
<lb/>Released Kubad from fetters. From the city
<lb/>They fared forth to the plain by night, unseen
<lb/>By foes, and made toward the Haitalians,
<lb/>Wrung with anxiety and hurrying.
<lb/>On this wise sped the seven like flying dust
<lb/>Until with dizzy heads they reached Ahwaz,
<lb/>And entered on their steeds that wealthy town—
<lb/>A town wherein a famous chieftain dwelt.
<lb/>Dismounting at the dwelling of the thane
<lb/>They tarried there and breathed themselves awhile.
<lb/>He had a daughter moonlike, crowned with musk,
<lb/>And, when Kubad beheld her face, all wisdom
<lb/>Fled from his youthful brain. He went forthwith,
<lb/>And told Rizmihr: <q>I have a privy word
<milestone unit="calced" n="1609"/>
<lb/>For thee. Haste to the thane. Tell him from me:—
<lb/><q>This moon-faced damsel—could she be my wife?</q></q>
<lb/>Rizmihr went instantly, informed the thane,
<lb/>And said: <q>If thy fair daughter is unmated
<lb/>I will provide her with a noble spouse,
<lb/>And thou shalt be the master of Ahwaz.</q>
<lb/>The illustrious thane made answer to Rizmihr:—
<lb/><q>My pretty daughter hath no husband yet,
<lb/>And, if she please thee, she is thine to give:
<lb/>Give her to him that longeth after her.</q>
</p>
<pb n="198"/>
<p>
<lb/>The wise Rizmihr came to Kubad and said:—
<lb/><q>May this Moon bring good fortune to the Shah.
<lb/>Thou sawest her unawares and didst approve,
<lb/>Thou didst approve of her just as she was.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad then called to him that fairy-faced;
<lb/>The gallant warrior set her on his knee,
<lb/>And having with him one, and but one, ring—
<lb/>A signet-ring whose worth was known to none—
<lb/>He gave it to her, saying: <q>Keep this signet;
<lb/>The day will come when I shall ask for it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He stayed a se'nnight for that fair Moon’s sake,
<lb/>And parted on the eighth day with the dawn,
<lb/>Went to the king of the Haitalians,
<lb/>Told what had chanced, the Iranians’ deeds, and how
<lb/>They all had girded up their loins for ill.
<lb/>The king replied: <q>The wrongs of Khushnawaz
<lb/>Have surely brought thee to this strait today.
<lb/>On these conditions will I give thee troops,
<lb/>Who are crown-wearers, every one of them,
<lb/>That if thou shalt recover crown and treasure,
<lb/>Chaghan, its wealth and state, its march and rule,
<lb/>Shall be all mine, and thou shalt keep my terms
<lb/>And stipulations.</q>
<lb/>Said Kubad while smiling
<lb/>At him who thus dictated terms: <q>I never
<lb/>Will give that land a thought and, when thou wishest,
<lb/>Will send thee troops in numbers numberless.
<lb/>What is Chaghan that I should look that way?</q>
<lb/>When they had made their pact the Haitalian king
<lb/>Unlocked his treasury and gave Kubad
<lb/>Dinars and arms, and two score thousand swordsmen,
<lb/>All famed as warriors and cavaliers.
<lb/>Thus to Ahwaz from the Haitalians went
<lb/>Kubad; the whole world rang with that event.
</p>
<pb n="199"/>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How Kubad returned from Haital to Iran, how he had Tidings
of the Birth of his Son, Nushirwan, and reascended the
Throne</head>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad approached the thane’s abode and saw
<lb/>In every street a scattered populace,
<lb/>Who all apprised him of the joyful news:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1610"/>
<lb/><q>Thy spouse brought forth a son to thee last night
<lb/>But little less resplendent than the moon,
<lb/>And may he bring good fortune to the Shah.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad, on hearing, went within the house
<lb/>In great content. They named the boy Kisra.
<lb/>Now afterwards Kubad asked of the thane:
<lb/><q>From whom art thou descended, noble sir?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>From valiant Faridun who took
<lb/>The kingship from the kindred of Zahhak:
<lb/>Thus said my father and my mother too:
<lb/><q>We give our reverence to Faridun.</q></q>
<lb/>Kubad was pleasured yet more at the words,
<lb/>And instantly resumed the royal crown.
<lb/>He had a litter brought and, when his spouse
<lb/>Was seated there, departed on his march;
<lb/>He led the army on to Taisafun
<lb/>In high joy with the Iranians.
<lb/>Now in Iran the while the ancient chiefs
<lb/>Sat with the sages and the notables.
<lb/>They said: <q>Between these two—both Shahs and proud—
<lb/>The matter will prove wearisome for us.
<lb/>Hosts are upon their way from Rum and Chin,
<lb/>And they will cause much bloodshed in the land.</q>
<lb/>Then one of that assembly said: <q>Ye chiefs,
<lb/>Exalted and heroic warriors!
<lb/>Tis needful that we go out to Kubad,

<pb n="200"/>

<lb/>Who, it may be, will not recall the past,
<lb/>And bring to him Jamasp, the ten years’ child,
<lb/>To turn the hailstones of his wrath to pearls;
<lb/>So haply we may swerve aside and 'scape
<lb/>From pillaging, from bloodshed, and from war.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>All went to meet Kubad and said to him:
<lb/><q>O Shah of royal race! if thou hast hurt
<lb/>Men’s hearts, and they have washed their hearts and eyes
<lb/>In petulance, now act as pleaseth thee
<lb/>Because the world-lord ruleth o’er the world.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They all drew near to him in haste, afoot,
<lb/>Dust-covered, and with gloomy souls. The Shah
<lb/>Forgave the evil doings of his lords,
<lb/>Accepting their excuse in lieu of bloodshed;
<lb/>He pardoned too Jamasp: the nobles blessed him.
<lb/>He came and sat upon the royal throne:
<lb/>Jamasp became his liege. Kubad bestowed
<lb/>The conduct of the realm upon Rizmihr,
<lb/>And gave him great advancement. By his means
<lb/>The kingship was well ordered, and the world
<lb/>Fulfilled with justice and prosperity.
<lb/>Thus matters fared until Kisra grew tall—
<lb/>A stripling bold and lusty. Then Kubad
<lb/>Entrusted to wise governors his son,
<lb/>That fresh and fruitful Bough. Kubad directed
<lb/>All matters in Iran and in Turan,
<lb/>And raised his crown of greatness to the sky.
<lb/>Thereafter he led forth his host to Rum,
<lb/>Which proved as ’twere a lump of wax to him:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1611"/>
<lb/>He made a thorn-brake of those fields and fells.
<lb/>Two cities asked for quarter at his hands,
<lb/>One Hinduyan, the other Fariyab.
<lb/>He taught the Zandavesta there, established
<lb/>The Faith, and instituted Fanes of Fire,
<lb/>His power, the feasts of New Year’s Day and Sade.
</p>
<pb n="201"/>
<p>
<lb/>He fixed his royal seat at Madain,
<lb/>And wrought much good and ill. He built a city
<lb/>Betwixt Ahwaz and Pars, and founded too
<lb/>A hospital. He called the city’s name
<lb/>Ardashir; the Arabs call it now Hulwan.
<lb/>They opened everywhere canals that flowed
<lb/>A-brim, and peace and rest on earth abode.
</p>


</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>The Story of Kubad and Mazdak, and how Kubad
adopted the Faith of Mazdak</head>
<p>
<lb/>Then there arose a man by name Mazdak,
<lb/>Learned, eloquent, judicious, and commanding,
<lb/>Of noble birth, a trafficker in knowledge,
<lb/>And brave Kubad gave ear to him. This man
<lb/>Became the king of kings’ chief minister,
<lb/>The treasurer and the guardian of the treasure.
<lb/>Then famine visited the world through atone
<lb/>A famine that afflicted great and small;
<lb/>No sign of snow appeared upon the sky,
<lb/>And none saw snow or rainfall in Iran.
<lb/>At length the nobles of the world begged bread
<lb/>And water at the portal of Kubad.
<lb/>Mazdak returned them this reply: <q>The Shah
<lb/>Will manifest to you a way of hope,</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then came himself in haste before the king,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>O upright Shah! I fain
<lb/>Would question thee upon a point if thou
<lb/>Wilt condescend to answer.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Eloquent
<lb/>Kubad replied: <q>Say on and make my lustre
<lb/>Fresh in the world.</q>
<lb/><q>A man,</q> Mazdak rejoined,
<lb/><q>Is bitten by a snake; his life is passing;

<pb n="202"/>

<lb/>Another man hath got the antidote
<lb/>Whereof the bitten can obtain no share.
<lb/>What then should be the guerdon of the man
<lb/>That hath it? Money will not purchase it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>He is a murderer,
<lb/>And should be slain to avenge the other’s blood
<lb/>Before my gate whenever the pursuer
<lb/>Shall take him.</q>
<lb/>Hearing this Mazdak went forth
<lb/>To those petitioners and told them thus:—
<lb/><q>I have discussed the matter with the Shah.
<lb/>Wait till the dawn, and I will show you how
<lb/>To right yourselves.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1612"/>
<p>
<lb/>They went away, returning
<lb/>At dawn with stricken hearts in deep affliction.
<lb/>Mazdak, when he beheld those chiefs from far,
<lb/>Ran from the portal to the Shah and said:—
<lb/><q>O thou victorious Shah and eloquent,
<lb/>Unsleeping, and the glory of the throne!
<lb/>Thou gavest me an answer, when I spake,
<lb/>And by that answer oped my bolted door,
<lb/>So now with thy permission I will speak
<lb/>A word to guide thee.</q>
<lb/><q>Speak,</q> the Shah replied,
<lb/><q>Lock not thy lips because thy words will help me.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Mazdak said: <q>Noble king! suppose a man,
<lb/>Whom thou hast bound, but they withhold from him
<lb/>All food until he dieth, thus perforce
<lb/>Surrendering sweet life. Now how should one
<lb/>Be punished who had bread yet left that captive
<lb/>In destitution? Will the great king say:—
<lb/><q>This man was wise and holy?</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said the Shah:—
<lb/><q>Rend such to pieces, for see his neglect
<lb/>He is a murderer.</q>
</p>
<pb n="203"/>
<p>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Mazdak, when he had kissed the ground, went forth.
<lb/>And from the portal thus harangued the crowd:—
<lb/><q>Go to the magazines where grain is stored,
<lb/>And help yourselves while if the owners ask
<lb/>Its value give them gold.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His own possessions
<lb/>Within that city he gave up to pillage
<lb/>In order that all folk might have their share.
<lb/>Then all the hungry rabble fared in haste
<lb/>To plunder every magazine of corn,
<lb/>Owned by the citizens or by Kubad,
<lb/>Who had none left to bless themselves withal.
<lb/>The officers, when they perceived this, went
<lb/>Before the watchful world-lord and thus said:—
<lb/><q>The mob have sacked the Shah’s own granaries,
<lb/>But all the fault recoileth on Mazdak.</q>
<lb/>Kubad bade call that man of eloquence,
<lb/>And talked with him about the pillaging.
<lb/>Mazdak replied: <q>Mayst thou be fortunate,
<lb/>And may thy words be wisdom’s daily food.
<lb/>I only told the wretched market-folk
<lb/>The words which I had heard the monarch speak.
<lb/>I asked the Shah about the snake and poison,
<lb/>And of the man who had the antidote.
<lb/>The Shah returned this answer to his servant
<lb/>Concerning him that had and him that sought it:—
<lb/><q>If any die of snake-bite in the city,
<lb/>Unhelped by one who hath the remedy,
<lb/>For such they shall require that niggard’s blood.</q>
<lb/>The Shah’s authority must not be slighted.
<lb/>Bread is the antidote for hungry men—
<lb/>An antidote not wanted by the full.
<lb/>If thou art one that judgest right, O Shah!
<lb/>Shall not the corn in store be put to use?
<lb/>To hunger have a multitude succumbed,
<lb/>Whose deaths are due to idle granaries.</q>
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1613"/>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad was much affected by the words:
<lb/>These righteous words aroused his brain to action.
<lb/>Then, questioning Mazdak and hearing him,
<lb/>The Shah perceived him learned in heart and brain
<lb/>In all things that the prophets, the archmages—
<lb/>Those righteous dealers—and the great had spoken.
<lb/>The teaching of Mazdak perverted him,
<lb/>And exercised unbounded influence.
<lb/>The multitude came thronging to Mazdak—
<lb/>The many that had wandered from the way:
<lb/>He said to them: <q>The man of empty hand
<lb/>Is equal to the man possessed of wealth.
<lb/>No one should have a superfluity,
<lb/>The wealthy is the warp, the poor the woof;
<lb/>To right the world all men must have sufficient;
<lb/>The rich man’s plenty is abominable;
<lb/>The women, goods, and houses are for all;
<lb/>The empty-handed and the rich are one.
<lb/>I will take order that the holy Faith
<lb/>Be manifest, the lofty from the low.

<lb/>The malison of God is on that div.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He treated mendicants, both old and young,
<lb/>As though they were the equals of himself,
<lb/>He took from this man and bestowed on that;
<lb/>The archmages were astonished at his doings.
<lb/>Kubad himself gave ear and was converted,
<lb/>And of all things was joyful in his words.
<lb/>He set Mazdak at his right hand although
<lb/>An archimage unknown to all the host,
<lb/>And unto him the mendicants resorted
<lb/>With those that earned a living by their toil;
<lb/>His Faith began to flourish in the world,
<lb/>And no one dared to seek revenge on him,
<lb/>The rich renounced the things that made them glad,
<lb/>And gave to mendicants what wealth they had.

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>How Nushirwan rejected the Faith of Mazdak and slew him and his Followers</head>
<p><pb n="205"/>
<lb/>It happened that Mazdak at dawn one day
<lb/>Went from his house and came before the Shah,
<lb/>And thus he said: <q>Of those that hold our Faith,
<lb/>As well as of our lieges pure of heart,
<lb/>A crowd of chiefs are at the door; shall I
<lb/>Admit them or shall they depart?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad,
<lb/>On hearing, bade the chamberlain admit them,
<lb/>Whereat Mazdak said to the noble Shah:—
<lb/><q>This house is narrow and the crowd is great,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1614"/>
<lb/>In sooth the audience-hall will hold them not;
<lb/>Let the Shah go and see them on the plain.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad commanded that his throne be brought,
<lb/>Brought from the royal palace to the waste,
<lb/>And there a hundred thousand Mazdakis
<lb/>Proceeded joyfully before the Shah,
<lb/>And thus Mazdak addressed the king of earth:—
<lb/><q>O thou above all knowledge and acclaim!
<lb/>Know that Kisra accepteth not our Faith,
<lb/>But is it fit that he should turn therefrom?
<lb/>We must obtain from him an undertaking
<lb/>In writing to give up his evil course.
<lb/>There are five things that turn men from the right,
<lb/>And e’en the sage can add no sixth. Now these
<lb/>Are anger, vengeance, jealousy, and need;
<lb/>The fifth is greed, which is predominant,
<lb/>And if thou conquer these five divs the way
<lb/>Of God will be made manifest to thee.
<lb/>From these five things it cometh that our women
<lb/>And wealth work havoc with the good religion,
<lb/>But will not meddle more if thou wilt keep it

<pb n="206"/>

<lb/>Intact. The twain cause jealousy, greed, need,
<lb/>While anger and revenge conspire with them,
<lb/>And thus the Div perverteth wise men’s heads:
<lb/>The twain should be a common property.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>This spoken, by the hand he grasped Kisra,
<lb/>What while the Shah looked on in wonderment.
<lb/>The noble prince in wrath withdrew his hand,
<lb/>And turned his eyes in anger from Mazdak,
<lb/>To whom Kubad said smiling: <q>Why art thou
<lb/>Concerned for the religion of Kisra?</q>
<lb/>Mazdak rejoined: <q>The way of righteousness
<lb/>Is not in him. He is not of our Faith.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah then questioned of Kisra and said:—
<lb/><q>What way is there except the good religion?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kisra replied: <q>If I shall have the time
<lb/>Allowed me I will prove this theory false.
<lb/>When both the fraud and falsehood shall appear
<lb/>My truth will show out more conspicuously.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Mazdak rejoined: <q>Thou askest of the Shah—
<lb/>The lustre of the world—how many days?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: <q>I ask a period of five months.
<lb/>The Shah shall have his answer in the sixth
<lb/>On all points.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They agreed and so departed.
<lb/>The exalted Shah returned to his own palace.
<lb/>Kisra dispatched a man to every quarter
<lb/>To look for sages and auxiliaries.
<lb/>An envoy went to Khurra-i-Ardshir
<lb/>To cause the old Hurmuzd to come to court,
<lb/>While from Istakhr came Mihr-Azar of Pars
<lb/>With thirty friends. These seekers after knowledge
<lb/>Held session and discussed the case at large,
<lb/>And then these men of lore and ancient sages
<lb/>Presented their conclusions to Kisra,
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1615"/>
<p>
<lb/>While he, when he had heard, went to Kubad,
<lb/>Discoursed with him about Mazdak, and said:—
<pb n="207"/>
<lb/><q>The time now hath arrived when I would make
<lb/>Investigation of the good religion.
<lb/>If then Mazdak be right, and if the Faith
<lb/>Delivered by Zarduhsht shall prove in fault,
<lb/>I will accept the true Faith of Mazdak,
<lb/>And make my soul’s choice his, for when the way
<lb/>Of Faridun, of Esdras, and of Christ,
<lb/>And all the Zandavasta, shall prove wrong,
<lb/>And when the doctrine of Mazdak shall stand,
<lb/>The world must take him for its only guide.
<lb/>If, on the other hand, his words are false,
<lb/>And he ensueth not God’s holy way,
<lb/>Then turn thee from the pathway of his Faith,
<lb/>Put far from thee this sorry Creed of his,
<lb/>And give him with his followers to me;
<lb/>God grant that none of them keep brain and skin.</q>

<lb/>He took as witnesses Rizmihr, Kharrad,
<lb/>Bihzad, Bandwi, and Faré’in, and thence
<lb/>Departed to his palace and observed
<lb/>The righteous covenant that he had made.
<lb/>At dawn, what time the sun displayed its crown,
<lb/>And earth was like a sea of ivory,
<lb/>The world-king’s son, that man of eloquence,
<lb/>Set forth with chieftains and with archimages.
<lb/>They went together to the royal palace.
<lb/>Their speech was fluent and their quest the Way.
<lb/>That youth—the Joy of hearts—came to Kubad,
<lb/>And oped the case, whereon an archimage
<lb/>Addressed Mazdak before the throng and said:—
<lb/><q>O seeker after wisdom! thou hast framed
<lb/>A new religion in the world and made
<lb/>Community of women and of goods.
<lb/>How will a father recognise his son,
<lb/>The son in like wise recognise his father?
<lb/>When every man is equal in the world,

<pb n="208"/>

<lb/>And great and little are no more discerned,
<lb/>Who then will serve, and how can any rule?
<lb/>Who then will labour for us, thee and me,
<lb/>And how shall good men be discerned from bad?
<lb/>When one shall die to whom will appertain
<lb/>His house and goods when toiling slave and Shah
<lb/>Are equal? This will desolate the world;
<lb/>Such evil must not come upon Iran.
<lb/>When all are masters who will be the servant?
<lb/>When all have treasure who be treasurer?
<lb/>None of the leaders of the Faith spake thus,
<lb/>And thou art mad although thou hidest it.
<lb/>Thou leadest all mankind to Hell, and thou
<lb/>Accountest not all evil-doing wrong.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad, when he had heard the archmage’s words,
<lb/>Was wroth and then gave sentence on the case.
<lb/>The illustrious Kisra supported him,
<lb/>The impious one grew full of fear at heart,
<lb/>While all the people there assembled cried:—
<lb/><q>Let not Mazdak remain before the Shah;
<lb/>He hath made havoc of the Faith of God;
<lb/>Let him not tarry at this famous court.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah became abhorrent from that Faith,
<lb/>The heads of all its chiefs grew full of care.
<lb/>He gave up to Kisra Mazdak forthwith
<lb/>With all that held that doctrine and that way—
<lb/>As many as three thousand men of name.
<lb/>The king at that time thus addressed his son:—
<lb/><q>Do with those chiefs as seemeth good to thee,
<lb/>And henceforth mention not Mazdak.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kisra
<lb/>Had at his court a pleasure-ground whose wall
<lb/>Was higher than a crow could fly. Around
<lb/>The circuit of that wall he dug a trench
<lb/>Wherein he set those men at intervals.
</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>
<lb/>They planted them like trees and firmly fixed
<lb/>Their feet aloft, their heads below. Kisra
<lb/>Addressed Mazdak on this wise: <q>Visit thou
<lb/>The entrance of my noble garth. The seed
<lb/>That thou hast scattered all this while hath brought
<lb/>Fruit forth to thee, O thou insensate one!
<lb/>Thou shalt see trees such as none e’er beheld,
<lb/>Or heard described by shrewd men heretofore.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Mazdak went, oped the portal of the garden,
<lb/>And thought maybe to see fruit-bearing trees,
<lb/>But seeing what he did he gave a cry,
<lb/>And then all consciousness abandoned him.
<lb/>Kisra gave orders for a lofty gibbet
<lb/>To be set up and at the top to fasten
<lb/>A twisted lasso. Thereupon he hung
<lb/>That impious wretch head-downwards and alive,
<lb/>And after slew him with a shower of arrows.
<lb/>If thou art prudent follow not Mazdak!
<lb/>The chiefs felt reassured about their wealth,
<lb/>Their women, children, and their pleasances.
<lb/>Kubad remained ashamed for many days,
<lb/>And cursed Mazdak, gave mendicants much largess,
<lb/>And offered gifts before the Fane of Fire.
<lb/>He gladdened at Kisra exceedingly
<lb/>Because that Bough of his bore fruit of gems.
<lb/>From that time forth the father sought alway
<lb/>The son’s advice and heard what he would say.

<div><head>XLI. NUSHIRWAN: HE REIGNED FORTY-EIGHT YEARS</head><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>
The poet tells of the accession of Nushirwan, his internal
administration, his repression of marauding tribes, his first war
with Rum, the revolt and death of his son Nushzad, of the rise
to power and wisdom of Buzurjmihr, the fall of Mahbud, the
Shah’s marriage with the daughter of the Khan, Buzurjmihr’s
discourse on good words and deeds, the introduction into Persia
of the game of chess and the Fables of Bidpai, the legend of the
invention of the former and that of the game of nard, the fall and
the restoration to favor of Buzurjmihr, the wisdom of Nushirwan,
his last war with Rum, his appointment of his successor, and death.
</p>
</div>
<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>
Kisra, surnamed Nushirwan (Chosroes I, A.D. 531-578), ruled
contemporaneously with three Eastern Roman Emperors—Justinian
(A.D. 527-565), Justin II (A.D. 565-574), and Tiberius II (A.D.
574-582). Justin resigned the rule to Tiberius, the captain of the
guards, in A.D. 574, but did not die till A.D. 578, the year of
Nushirwan’s death. Nushirwan was perhaps the greatest of the
twenty-nine Sasanian Shahs, at least it is not easy to assign that
title to any other unless we reserve it for the founder of the
dynasty, Ardshir Papakan, who has to his credit the overthrow of
a long-standing foreign domination, the re-establishment of a
national dynasty, and all the toil of political reconstruction that
his successful revolt against the last Arsacid involved.
It will be seen that the poet had plenty of material for this
portion of his undertaking. The subject-matter falls naturally
into certain well-defined divisions; accordingly we have broken

<pb n="213"/>

up the reign, as in the case of that of Gushtasp, <note n="1">Vol. v. p. 9.</note> into Parts, but
there is no such arrangement in the original.
Kisra will be referred to throughout by his popular title of
Nushirwan.
</p>
<p>
The principal historical events recorded by Firdausi in his
account of the reign may be placed in approximate chronological
order as follows:—
<list>
<item>The fall of Mahbud.</item>
<item>The reorganisation of the kingdom, finances, and army.</item>
<item>The chastisement of barbarous frontier-tribes,</item>
<item>The fortification of Darband.</item>
<item>The first war with Rum (A.D. 540-562).</item>
<item>The revolt of Nushzad (A.D. 551).</item>
<item>Nushirwan’s marriage with the daughter of the Khan.</item>
<item>The introduction into Persia of the Fables of Bidpai (about A.D. 570).</item>
<item>The birth of Muhammad (about A.D. 571).</item>
<item>The second war with Rum (A.D. 572).</item>
<item>The first eight of these are included in the present volume.</item>

<div><head>PART I: NUSHIRWAN’S ADMINISTRATION OF THE REALM, HIS WARS WITH FRONTIER-TRIBES AND WITH RUM, AND THE REVOLT OF NUSHZAD</head><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<pb n="214"/>



<p>Nushirwan ascends the throne and makes an oration to the people.
He divides the realm into four provinces, and takes order for all
matter civil and military. He builds a wall in the Caucasus and
represses the Aldns and the men of Baliich and Gilin. He espouses
the cause of Munzir, the Arab, against Caesar, invades Rum, takes
cities, and compels Caesar to sue for peace and to pay tribute. On
a false report of the Shah’s death his son, Nushzad, a Christian,
attempts to seize the crown. Nushirwan writes to his general, Ram
Barzin, instructing him how to proceed, and Nushzad is defeated
and slain.</p>
</div>
<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>§ 2. Nushirwan’s accession to the throne was not universally
popular and gave rise to a formidable conspiracy in favour of one
of his nephews.<note n="1">See p. 316. </note></p>

<p>§ 3. Nushirwan’s division of his empire into four satrapies differs
in details in the different authorities, but seems to have been
suggested by the names of the four winds. According to Dinawari
the East included Khurdsan, Sistan, and Kirdan; the North
Ispahan, Kum, Media Magna, and Azarbaijan; the South Pars and
Ahwaz; the West Iraq to the Roman frontier.<note n="2">NT, p. 155, note. </note>
Firdausi includes the Khazars in the South division—a mistake. They lived
beyond the Caucasus.<note n="3">See Vol. iv. p. 316.</note>
He includes too Rum in the West division
on the assumption, for which there was certainly some justification
at this time, that Rum was tributary to Iran. A peace or truce
concluded between Justinian and Nushirwan involved almost as
a matter of course a money-payment from the former to the latter.
It did not follow that Justinian always got the worst of the bargain.
For instance, in the definite treaty of peace between the two

<pb n="215"/>

empires in A.D. 562, Nushirwan’s renunciation of Lazica (Mingrelia
and Imeritia), and consequently of his dream of a fleet and of assail-
ing Rum by sea, was well worth the thirty thousand pieces of gold
to be paid annually by Justinian though it did lay the Emperor
open to the imputation of being tributary to the Shah. Traditional
instances of such payments crop up in the Shahnama as far back
as the days of Darab and Failakus.<note n="1">See vol. vi. p. 24. </note></p>

<p>The popular version of the origin of Kubid’s resolve to alter the
system of taxation has been given already.<note n="2">p. 183, notes aah</note>
It was left to
Nushirwan to carry it out. According to Tabari the taxes imposed
were as follows:—On every garib of corn-land, i.e., sown with
wheat or barley, a ground-tax of one drachm was imposed, on
every garib of vineyard eight, and of lucerne seven; on four
Persian date-palms, six common date-palms, provided that they
grew in plantations or in numbers, and on six olives, one drachm.
Single, scattered trees were not taxed. On all men between the
ages of twenty and fifty a poll-tax varying, according to the
fortune of a man, was imposed. The people were arranged in classes
and paid twelve, eight, six, or four drachms according to their means.
The taxes were paid yearly in three instalments at intervals of
four months. Schedules of the taxes were drawn up, one of which
was kept at the royal chancery, one sent to each collector, and one
to each district-judge. The judges were priests and were charged
particularly with the duty of seeing that the collectors did not
exceed the tariff, and also, in cases where the crops had been
damaged, with the duty of remitting taxation to a proportionate
amount. The nobility, soldiers, priests, scribes, and others in the
royal service, were exempt from the poll-tax.<note n="3">NT, p. 244. A garib is said to have been equal to 3600 square ells and a drachm to 88 centimes. Id. pp. 242, 245, notes.</note>
They were supposed to render their due to the State in other ways.</p>

<p>§6. Faridin had his capital in Madzandaran. See Vol. i. pp.
177, 230. For the vegetation of that region, which is very luxu-
riant, see Vol, ii, pp. 27, 31.</p>
<p>
For the fortifications at Darband, see p. 187 and Vol. i. p. 16.
Mas’udi’s two accounts of Nushirwan’s wall, as given in the
French translation, are as follows:—<quote>Appelé dans le pays d’El-Bab et dans le Caucase par les incursions des rois du voisinage, il
bâtit sur la mer (Caspienne), à l’aide d’outres de cuir gonflées, une
muraille de rochers, qu’il consolida avec le fer et le plomb. Ces
outres s’enfonçaient dans l’eau, à mesure que la construction
s'élevait; lorsqu’elles s’arrêtèrent sur le fond et que la muraille

<pb n="216"/>

dépassa le niveau de l’eau, des plongeurs, armés de poignards et
de coutelas, crevèrent les outres; la muraille, entrant profondément
dans le sol sous-marin, atteignit alors la hauteur du rivage. Elle
existe encore aujourd’hui, en 332,<note n="1">A.D. 943. </note>
et toute la partie de cette
muraille dont les assises plongent dans la mer est nommée el-kaid
(la chaîne), parce qu’elle arrête les bâtiments ennemis qui ten-
teraient d’aborder sur cette côte. On continua le même travail
le long du rivage, entre le Caucase et la mer; on pratiqua des
portes donnant sur le territoire infidèle, et l’on prolongea la
muraille sur le mont Caucase, ainsi que nous l’avons dit ci-dessus,
en décrivant cette montagne et la ville d’El-Bab.</quote><note n="2">MM, ii. 196.</note>
</p>
<p>
The other account referred to is this:—<quote>Le Kabkh est une
grande chaîne de montagnes qui renferme, dans sa vaste étendue,
‘un nombre considérable de royaumes et de tribus: en effet, on
n'y compte pas moins de soixante-douze peuplades, qui ont
chacune leur chef et parlent une langue qui leur est propre. Ces
montagnes sont sillonnées de gorges et de vallées; c’est à la tête
de l’un de ces défilés que se trouve la ville de Bab-el-Abwab, bâtie
par Kosroes Anushirwan, sur un point intermédiaire entre le pays
montueux et la mer des Khazars. Le même souverain construisit
cette célèbre muraille qui, d’une part, s'avance dans la mer, jusqu’à
une distance d’environ un mille des côtes, et, d’autre part, s’élève
sur les sommets abrupts des montagnes et descend dans leurs
gorges profondes, sur une longueur de quarante parasanges, jusqu’à
ce qu’elle aboutisse à une place forte nommée Tabarestan. De
trois milles en trois milles à peu près, suivant l'importance de la
route sur laquelle elle s’ouvrait, il plaça une porte de fer, près
de laquelle il installa, dans l'intérieur de l'enceinte, une peuplade
chargée de veiller à sa garde et à celle de la muraille. Ce rempart
devait opposer une barrière infranchissable aux attaques des tribus
voisines du Kabkh, telles que les Khazars, les Alains, les Turcs, les
Serirs et les autres peuplades infidèles.</quote><note n="3">Id., p. 1. </note>
</p>

<p>
One of the terms of peace made between Nushirwan and
Justinian, after the death of Kubad, was that Persia should be
paid the sum of eleven thousand pounds of gold towards the
maintenance of the defences in the Caucasus and should undertake
the actual defence herself.<note n="4">RSM, p. 382.</note>
</p>

<p>
For Sikandar’s wall, built, according to the legend, with a similar
purpose, see Vol. vi. p. 163.
</p>

<p>§7. Nushirwan’s dealings with the Alans and the folk of Gilan
<pb n="217"/>

are historical, but Firdausi substitutes the Baluchis, who made
themselves very troublesome in his time, for another tribe,
mentioned in his authorities but unknown to him, which dwelt
north of the Caucasus<note n="1">NT, p. 157, note. </note>
It is very unlikely that any of the
Sasanian Shahs ever got as far East as Hindustan.
</p>



<p>
§§ 8-10. The accession of Nushirwan found Persia and the
Eastern Roman Empire at war, but a year or two later he concluded
what was known as the <quote>the endless peace</quote> with Justinian. The
title was somewhat unfortunate, as in A.D. 540 war again broke out
owing, according to Firdausi and Tabari, to the treatment of
Munzir, prince of Hira (A.D. 505-554), by the Romans. He was
Nushirwan’s protégé and had a dispute with Harith bin Jabala,
the Ghassanian and Justinian’s protégé, about a pasturage for
sheep south of Palmyra. Harith, as Tabari states, attacked Munzir,
made a great slaughter of his people, and carried off much booty.
Munzir appealed to Nushirwan, who could get no accommodation
from Justinian, and war ensued between the two empires.<note n="2">Id. p. 238; BLRE, i. 418.</note></p>

<p>Historically of course there were other reasons, one of the chief
being that Justinian, secured on his Persian frontier by the
<quote>endless peace,</quote> had availed himself of the opportunity and the
services of Belisarius to extend and almost double his possessions
by conquests in the West. <quote>Both his friends and his enemies said,
with hate or admiration, <q>The whole earth cannot contain him;
he is already scrutinising the ether and the retreats beyond the
ocean, if he may win some new world.</q></quote><note n="3">Id. </note>
Justinian’s success
threatened to upset the balance of power. Probably, too, there were
always <quote>pin-pricks</quote> going on between the two empires.</p>

<p>§11. The Fire-temple visited by Nushirwan before beginning his
campaign was probably not one at Tabriz but the more famous one
at what is now Takht-i-Sulaiman, about one hundred miles to the
South. It was to this latter that the Sasanian Shahs were wont to
resort at important epochs in their lives.<note n="4">Cf. pp. 5, 86, 94.</note>
</p>

<p>It will be noticed that a Mihran commands the centre of
Nushirwan’s host—another instance of the prominent part played
by this family of Arsacid descent in Sasanian times. Cf. p. 185.</p>

<p>§12. Crossing the Euphrates Nushirwan marched along its
western bank till he reached Sura, the Greek τα Ζωτικά and the
Shurab of Firdausi, which was taken without difficulty, sacked, and
burnt. The Shah then advanced to Hierapolis, the Ardyish-i-Rum
of the Shahnama, which was allowed to ransom itself for two

<pb n="218"/>

thousand pounds of silver.<note n="1">RSM, p. 387. </note>
Hierapolis sounds somewhat like
Ardyish, which means <quote>ornament,</quote> so it would seem that the
poet converted the name of that city into Ardyish-i-Rum or
<quote>Ornament of Rum.</quote></p>



<p>§13. On leaving this city Nushirwan, according to Firdausi,
encountered and defeated a Roman army led by Farfuriyus.
Historically, the Persians in their advance on Antioch, in the course
of which they held Chalybon-Beroea (Aleppo) to ransom, appear to
have been unopposed. The occupation of Callinicus (Callinicus)
did not take place till the third campaign (A.D. 543) when the city
made no resistance, and the inhabitants were led away captive.
It was situated on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. In A.D. 531,
however, Belisarius, after foiling an attempt of a combined force of
Persians and Arabs to raid Antioch, was worsted in a battle at
Callinicus; so the two campaigns may have become confused in
tradition. Germanus, Justinian’s nephew, had been at Antioch
before the Persians reached and stormed it in A.D. 540, but had
withdrawn as he considered the existing fortifications could not
be held with success. The taking of Antakiya (Antioch) was
Nushirwan’s crowning achievement in this his first campaign
against Rum, and he returned home by another route, compelling
various cities to ransom themselves on his way. Farfuriyus is
probably Firdausi’s rendering of a Byzantine title. Belisarius took
no part in the campaign of A.D. 540; he only returned from Italy
in that year.</p>

<p>§14. That Nushirwan built a new Antioch on the Tigris, not far
from Ctesiphon, as a residence for his Roman captives is no doubt
historical, though we need not commit ourselves to Tabari’s state-
ment that the new town was so exactly a reproduction of the
original that the captives, on arriving, went to their own houses as
naturally as if they had never left home.<note n="2">NT, p. 165.</note>
The cordwainer from
Callinicus would be a later arrival.<note n="3">See above. </note>
The new Antioch was also
known as Rumiya or <quote>The Roman</quote> and by other names.</p>

<p>§15. Negotiations for peace had been going on even during the
first year of the war, though they came to nothing, but five years later
a suspension of hostilities was agreed upon for five years. Justinian
had to give Nushirwan two thousand pounds of gold.<note n="4">RSM, pp. 391 seq., 404.</note>
Firdausi
does not carry the story of the war further. Peace was made, after
the resumption of the war which was followed by another five
years’ truce, definitively in A.D. 562.</p>

<pb n="219"/>

<p>§§ 16-19. The revolt of Nushzad, <q>Immortal-born,</q> is historical,
and the circumstances attending it may be stated fairly correctly
perhaps as follows. He seems to have been Nushirwan’s eldest son,
and to have been brought up as a Christian by his mother, who was
in that Shah’s seraglio and of course a Christian herself. On
account of his religion, or for some other reason, he was interned
by his father at Gund-i-Shapur,<note n="1">See Vol. vi. p. 295. </note> which contained a strong Christian
element and was the seat of the Nestorian Metropolitan—the next
in rank to the Patriarch.<note n="2">NT, p. 41.</note> When the news, false as it turned out,
of his father’s death reached him he had every reason to bestir him-
self. In the circumstances there was a likelihood of his being
passed over in the matter of the succession. His father’s known
disapproval, the rivalry of his brothers, and his own religion, were
obstacles which had to be faced promptly if at all, while as the
eldest-born it was only natural that he should aspire to the vacant
throne. At the time when his rising occurred (A.D. 551) there was
a five years’ truce in force between Persia and the Eastern Roman
Empire, so it is not likely that he got much help from that quarter.
Probably Justinian never heard of the affair till it was all over.
The Christian inhabitants of Gund-i-Shapur naturally would
support Nushzad, and it is interesting to find that the leader of his
troops is Shammis—a word meaning a Christian priest or deacon.
The general Persian opinion of Christians is shown by the word
<foreign>tarsa,</foreign> which means a Christian because its primary meaning is
<gloss>cowardly,</gloss> but it does not appear that Firdausi shared that view;
on the contrary, when obviously putting his own words into the
mouths of his characters, he treats the Church militant, especially
the episcopacy, with much respect.<note n="3">E.g., Vol. i. p. 378. Cf., too, the parable of the kerchiefs where Christianity is meant by the <gloss>Faith of Yitindan,</gloss> which is described as being <quote>good.</quote> Vol. vi. p. 95.</note> It is very unlikely therefore
that the derogatory words concerning Christianity in the utterances
of Nushirwan and Piruz were the poet’s own. Neither are they
characteristically Muhammadan. Firdausi found them in his
authorities translated from the Pahlavi. Historically, Nushzad does
not appear to have fallen in the fight: he fell into his father’s
hands, was blinded probably, imprisoned, and disappeared from his-
tory. The concluding scene of the story may be regarded therefore
as the poet’s own contribution to it. There is nothing polemical
there, but all is characterised by dignity and good feeling.<note n="4">For Nushzad generally see NT, p. 467.</note></p>

<lb/><q>O lofty Cypress, thou that ravishest
<lb/>The heart! Oh! wherefore art thou thus opprest?
<lb/>With pleasure, Grace, and luxury anear
<lb/>Why is thine ardent heart fulfilled with fear?</q>
<lb/>Said to the questioner the Cypress-tree:
<lb/><q>'T was in Joy ere age o’ermastered me.
<lb/>I yield me to the puissance of three-score,
<lb/>Forbear then and contend therewith no more,
<lb/>For it hath dragon’s breath and lion’s claw,
<lb/>And whomsoe’er it flingeth it will gnaw.
<lb/>It hath the might of wolf, and thunder-breath,
<lb/>In one hand care and in the other death.
<lb/>It maketh stoop the Cypress that subdued
<lb/>All hearts, it maketh jasmine amber-hued;
<lb/>It giveth saffron’s tint to cercis-bloom,
<lb/>And, after saffron’s tint, a toilful doom.
<lb/>The runner’s foot is bound though fetterless,
<lb/>The precious body turned to wretchedness;
<lb/>The lustrous pearls begin to fail with me,
<lb/>And stoopeth too the noble cypress-tree;
<lb/>My melancholy eyes bewail and run
<lb/>Through their debility and travail done;
<lb/>My blithe, glad heart is full of pain, and thus
<lb/>These days of mine have grown ungenerous.
<lb/>Or ever man is weaned his death is nigh,
<lb/>And people call him old! The sovereignty
<lb/>Of Nushirwan was forty years and eight;
<lb/>To look for youth at sixty is too late
<lb/>For thee, so seek an end to thine affairs,
<lb/>And wound thy heart no more by gainful cares.</q><note n="1">There is no break here in the original.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How Nushirwan ascended the Throne and made an Oration
to the Iranians</head>
<p><pb n="221"/>
<lb/>When Nushirwan<note n="1">Kisra in the original, but henceforth we write Nushirwan.</note>
assumed the ivory throne,
<lb/>And donned the crown—the lustre of the heart—
<lb/>The great men of the world were gathered there
<lb/>What time the Shah sat with his counsellors.
<lb/>That chief of famous men then loosed his tongue,
<lb/>Invoked the righteous Giver of all good,
<lb/>And said: <q>Be our hearts filled with praise and love
<lb/>Toward the almighty Ruler of the sky,
<lb/>From whom are good and ill, fame and desire,
<lb/>By whom I am made sorrowful and glad,
<lb/>Of whom are Grace and strength. By His command
<lb/>The sun is bright in heaven. We will not quit
<lb/>His counsels and His covenant, or reckon
<lb/>Our breaths but at His bidding. He that doth
<lb/>That which is Just upon the throne of power
<lb/>Will have fruition of good fortune here;
<lb/>But he that harboureth an ill intent
<lb/>Will bring disaster on himself at last.
<lb/>Whate’er ye ask of us we will reply,
<lb/>And in our answer will advise you well.
<lb/>None wotteth of the secrets of the heart;
<lb/>That is a way too strait for me to find;
<lb/>But still if justice be the Shah’s employ
<lb/>It surely will rejoice the hearts of all.
<lb/>Delay not till the morrow this day’s work;
<lb/>How know’st thou what to-morrow will bring forth?
<lb/>The rose in bloom to-day will have
<lb/>But worthless flowers for thee to cull to-morrow.
<lb/>In days when thou art hale be not unmindful
<lb/>Of malady, of suffering, and of loss;</q>
<pb n="222"/>

<lb/><q>Think of the day of death which closeth life,
<lb/>And how with death we are as leaves with wind.
<lb/>When thou art slack to act thou makest all
<lb/>Thy policy unsound. When envy swayeth
<lb/>The heart of man no leech can cure that ache.
<lb/>When passion mastereth wisdom is't not proof
<lb/>Of madness? Furthermore, none honoureth
<lb/>The quarrelsome and talkative. The path
<lb/>That leadeth thee to guile is gloomier,
<lb/>To right is straiter. Skilful as thou art,
<lb/>If thou art lazy and perfunctory
<lb/>Thy work will turn out ill. Whene’er the tongue
<lb/>Is wedded to deceit it hath no lustre
<lb/>From heavenly fortune. Feckless folk resort
<lb/>To lying, and we can but weep for such.
<lb/>Whenas the Shah is first to rise from slumber
<lb/>He will be safe from foes and hale of body.
<lb/>Be wise and have withal enough to eat,
<lb/>But more than this is anguish, toil, and greed.
<lb/>Whenas a Shah is just and liberal
<lb/>The world is full of goodness and of peace,
<lb/>But if he thwarteth justice in its course
<lb/>He eateth colocynth and drinketh blood.
<lb/>All ye in this assembly! Hear what
<lb/>I proclaim to you, learn it, observe it well,
<lb/>And all your years fare side by side with fortune:
<lb/>Full many a crowned monarch have we scanned,
<lb/>And our choice is the path of right and wisdom;
<lb/>Yet must ye listen to my minister,
<lb/>For good and ill appear not save through him.<note n="1">Reading with P,</note>

<lb/>Whoever cometh to this court of mine
<lb/>With just cause whether in or out of season,
<lb/>No minister of mine will I approve
<lb/>That keepeth such a matter hid from me.
<lb/>As for the officers about my court,
<pb n="223"/>

<lb/>And valiant cavaliers among my troops,
<lb/>As we stint not the stipend due to them
<lb/>So must they tender mine own name and fame.
<lb/>Let all be done humanely and uprightly
<lb/>Without defect of justice. Every one,
<lb/>That, being an Iranian, girdeth him
<lb/>To do his service in this court of ours,
<lb/>Shall have both treasure and kind words from us
<lb/>If he shall prove a shrewd and modest servant;

<lb/>He shall be punished for his wickedness,
<lb/>And we should grieve not o’er the fall of one
<lb/>So despicable. Keep within your hearts
<lb/>The laws of holy God and fear not us,
<lb/>For He is King of kings, Lord of the world,
<lb/>Victorious, and One whose word is law,
<lb/>The Illuminer of crown and sun and moon,
<lb/>Who showeth us the way of righteousness.
<lb/>Lord of the world is He, the Judge of judges,
<lb/>And higher than the thoughts of every man.
<lb/>He hath created heaven, space, and time,
<lb/>And hath adorned our souls and hearts with love.
<lb/>He is the Guard of crown and lofty throne,
<lb/>And when thou seekest help will succour thee.
<lb/>Tis He hath fired your hearts with love of us,
<lb/>His will hath blinded, heart and eye, our foes.
<lb/>Well-being is all subject to His hest,

<lb/>All from the stubble to the seventh heaven—
<lb/>Air, fire, and water, and our gloomy earth—
<lb/>Bear witness to His being and afford

<lb/>Whate’er we praise is under His command,
<lb/>And all our worship dedicate to Him.</q>
<pb n="224"/>

<lb/>When Nushirwan had spoken all the world
<lb/>Was lost in wonder at him. To their feet
<lb/>All rose with praise anew the Shah to greet.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>How Nushirwan divided his Realm into four Parts and wrote
a Decree to his Officers on the Administration of Justice</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king of kings called unto him the wise,
<lb/>And settled the affairs of all the world.
<lb/>The world itself he parted into four,
<lb/>Assigning that which was inhabited.
<lb/>He first of all for Khurdsan took thought,
<lb/>And filled thereby the nobles’ hearts with joy.
<lb/>The second part was Kum and Ispahan—
<lb/>The seat of magnates and the place of chiefs—
<lb/>Wherewith Azarabadagan, whereon
<lb/>The Iranians lavished offerings, was comprised.
<lb/>That Shah of wary heart<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>included too
<lb/>Armenia up to Ardabil and Gil.
<lb/>The third from east to west was formed of Pars,
<lb/>Ahwaz, and of the marches of Khazar.
<lb/>Irak together with the land of Rum
<lb/>Came fourth—a splendid realm and populous—
<lb/>And in these marches to the indigent,
<lb/>Who had to toil to satisfy their needs,
<lb/>The Shah made largess of his hoarded treasures,
<lb/>And all folk blessed him.
<lb/>Now of former Shahs—
<lb/>Shahs greater or inferior to himself—
<lb/>All had required a portion of the crops,
<lb/>And no man thitherto had 'scaped the tax.
<lb/>The royal portion was a third or fourth
<pb n="225"/>

<lb/>Until Kavad came and required a tenth.
<lb/>He meant to have reduced it further still,
<lb/>And strove to make the lowly like the lord,
<lb/>But fortune gave him not the time.<note n="1">Cf. p. 183, note.</note>
<lb/>Whilst thou
<lb/>Art in the stream ne’er trust the crocodile.
<lb/>The crown of worship came to Nushirwan,
<lb/>And he remitted all the tenth forthwith.
<lb/>The sages, chiefs, great men, and archimages,
<lb/>The shrewd of heart, assembled—all the rulers.
<lb/>They had the land partitioned and surveyed,
<lb/>And laid thereon a land-tax of one drachm
<lb/>So that the owners might not be distressed.
<lb/>All that lacked seed or beast, when they should be
<lb/>Preparing for the crops, were subsidised
<lb/>Out of the treasure of the king of kings
<lb/>So that they might not let the ground lie fallow.
<lb/>Land, if untilled, was left out of account;
<lb/>The previous usages were done away.
<lb/>On each six fruiting vines a drachm was levied,
<lb/>Date-palm plantations paid an equal tax,
<lb/>While each ten stems of olives and of walnuts,
<lb/>And other trees that bear their fruit in autumn,
<lb/>Brought one drachm to the treasury, and this
<lb/>Was made the only burden of the year.
<lb/>To fruits that ripened in the month Khurdad
<lb/>No heed was paid in taxing. From the men
<lb/>Of means who neither owned nor tilled the soil
<lb/>The tax-collector every year received
<lb/>A payment varying from ten drachms to four;
<lb/>But no one was oppressed because the money
<lb/>Was paid in three instalments annually,
<lb/>And thus a third part of the tax was paid
<lb/>Each four months to the exchequer of the Shah.
<lb/>The royal scribes and officers employed
<lb/>Within the taxing-office passed all count.

<pb n="226"/>

<lb/>The Shah had these above-named tolls and imposts
<lb/>Recorded by the archmages in three ledgers,
<lb/>Whereof he gave one to the treasurer,
<lb/>And made that minister account for it;
<lb/>The second was for sending through the realm
<lb/>To all officials and the men in power;
<lb/>The third was handed to the archimages
<lb/>To keep account of all the revenue.
<lb/>All that concerned tax, toll, and husbandry
<lb/>Was done by order of the Shah himself,
<lb/>And he had agents scattered everywhere
<lb/>To keep him cognisant of good and ill.
<lb/>He filled with justice all the face of earth,
<lb/>And cultivated all the barren lands;
<lb/>Both great and small slept safely on the waste,
<lb/>And sheep and wolf came to one trough. He bade
<lb/>To draw up in the olden tongue a letter—
<lb/>One that will pleasure thee to hear from me.
<lb/>It thus began: <q>From Nushirwan, the chief—
<lb/>The king of kings, the worshipper of God,
<lb/>A Bough fruit-bearing from the Tree Kavad—
<lb/>Who hath assumed the crown of majesty,
<lb/>And in especial prospered all the land,
<lb/>For God, the just Judge, gave him Grace divine,
<lb/>To all the officers of revenue—
<lb/>Thralls of the shadow of our Grace and throne—
<lb/>Our well-weighed greetings unto you whose birth
<lb/>Hath been exceeded by your own deserts.
<lb/>Here at the outset of our task we first
<lb/>Give praises to the Maker of the world.
<lb/>Know that the man is wise and shrewd of heart,
<lb/>Whose praise is of the righteous Judge of earth,
<lb/>Well knowing that He hath no need of us,
<lb/>And that all secrets are revealed to Him,
<lb/>Who when He willeth to exalt a man
<lb/>First maketh him superior to all want.</q>
<pb n="227"/>
<lb/>He bade me judge, but He is Judge Himself,
<lb/>And higher than all height eternally.
<lb/>In God’s sight king and subject are as one,
<lb/>And saving service none hath aught to do;
<lb/>From the abyss of earth to heaven above,
<lb/>And from the sun to dark and sorry dust,
<lb/>The ant’s foot beareth witness that He is,
<lb/>That we are bondslaves and that He is king.
<lb/>All His commands to us are righteousness;
<lb/>It is the Div that causeth lies and loss.
<lb/>Now if my portion of the spacious world
<lb/>Had been a garden only, park, and palace,
<lb/>My heart had chosen naught but love and justice,
<lb/>And kept a smiling face for everything;
<lb/>But now the expanse of all the world throughout
<lb/>From east to west hath God, the Holy One,
<lb/>Bestowed upon me as my sovereignty—
<lb/>All from the bright sun to the darksome dust
<lb/>And I must practise naught save love and justice
<lb/>Although I furrow mine own face thereby.
<lb/>If careless be the shepherd and the waste
<lb/>Thus vast the sheep will 'scape not from the wolf.
<lb/>As for my subjects, whether country-folk
<lb/>Or those devoted to the Cult of Fire,
<lb/>Be they in drouthy dust or ship at sea
<lb/>By day or night alike, or be they merchants,
<lb/>Engaged in voyaging over wet and dry
<lb/>With monies and with lustrous pearls and musk,
<lb/>The sun must shine not from the arch of heaven
<lb/>Upon them save in justice and in love.
<lb/>Now this hath been the custom of our race
<lb/>That son should have his father’s crown and this
<lb/>The world hath recognised as just and right
<lb/>With one consent in public and in private.
<lb/>We have imposed a land-tax and a tree-tax
<lb/>For sustentation of the throne and crown.

<pb n="228"/>

<lb/>Now when they bring this letter to you may
<lb/>Ahura Mazda prove fortunate to you. Whoever
<lb/>Herein transgresseth by a single drachm,
<lb/>Or doth injustice for a single breath,
<lb/>I swear by God, who hath bestowed upon me
<lb/>The diadem of Grace, that I will saw
<lb/>That man in twain; such is God’s chastisement
<lb/>On those whose evil seed hath come to fruit.
<lb/>Observe this letter and this ordinance,
<lb/>And turn not from the glorious Way and Faith.
<lb/>Demand with justice and with courtesy
<lb/>The instalment of the tax due each four months;
<lb/>But where the locusts have been ravaging,
<lb/>Or sunbeams beaten on the parched-up earth,
<lb/>Or where the blast or lightning of high heaven
<lb/>Hath brought disaster on the cultured fields,
<lb/>Or if rain falleth not at the New Year,
<lb/>So that the jocund crops are vexed with drought,
<lb/>Demand no tax upon those fields and crops,
<lb/>Because the spring-clouds have not watered them,
<lb/>And pay the seed sown and the labourers' hire
<lb/>Back to the farmers from the treasury.
<lb/>The lands whose owner is deceased and hath
<lb/>No kith and kin must lie not waste, for they
<lb/>Are underneath the shadow of the Shah;
<lb/>Else will the foe make scorn of my resources
<lb/>With such a pretext ready to his hand.
<lb/>Give what is needed from the treasury,
<lb/>For God hath set me out of reach of need.
<lb/>If lands within my power lie desolate,
<lb/>Unsheltered by the shadow of my wing,
<lb/>Whoe’er he be that is responsible,
<lb/>And doth neglect the task, hard though it be,
<lb/>Him, whether lord or underling, will I
<lb/>Hang from the gibbet on the spot. The great—
<lb/>The Shahs of yore—had other usages,

<pb n="229"/>

<lb/>With their officials rested right and wrong,
<lb/>The world lay open to the cavaliers,
<lb/>Who wantonly mocked wisdom and ne’er rested
<lb/>From adding to their wealth. My wealth is justice;
<lb/>The people of the land compose my host;
<lb/>I will not cast a glance upon dinars.
<lb/>To win by equity the world’s regard,
<lb/>And to respect the worth of men of birth,
<lb/>Are dearer to me than the wealth of foes
<lb/>That seek to win my kingdom and my throne.
<lb/>The general that selleth men for gold
<lb/>Shall get no entry to my court whereat
<lb/>They are esteemed that follow justice, love,
<lb/>Law and the Way. When my shrewd officers
<lb/>Assemble at the office of the archmage,
<lb/>And falsehood showeth in the words of any,
<lb/>He shall receive no grace from us henceforth.
<lb/>I do not love the man that is unjust;
<lb/>The leopard and the oppressor are as one.
<lb/>All they that have ensued the way of God,
<lb/>And bathed their dark souls in the stream of wisdom,
<lb/>Shall have a lofty station at our court,
<lb/>High estimation with the archimages,
<lb/>And from their God for that which they have sown
<lb/>The recompense of jocund Paradise.
<lb/>We are ourselves exempt from need of wealth
<lb/>Whereby the soul is diminished and accursed.
<lb/>He that doth eat the flesh of mendicants
<lb/>Will find, no doubt, some nurture in their skins.
<lb/>A pard is better than a king like that,
<lb/>Who hath no modesty, no rule, no Faith.
<lb/>The way of right is open to us. Why
<lb/>Knock we in folly on the door of loss?
<lb/>To do ill closely, justice openly,
<lb/>So that the fame thereof may come to us,
<lb/>Will have not God’s approval, or be held

<pb n="230"/>

<lb/>In high consideration at our court;
<lb/>But he hath God’s approval and our own
<lb/>Whose love and justice are as warp and woof.</p>

<p>
<lb/>If thou art just, O monarch! thou wilt give
<lb/>The world a record of thee that will live,
<lb/>For every one will praise eternally
<lb/>The Shah that brought the world prosperity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Nushirwan required Babak to muster the Host</head>
<p>
<lb/>Of all the Shahs that erst had throne and crown,
<lb/>And had been great in treasure and in troops,
<lb/>There was not one more just than Nushirwan,
<lb/>And may his soul be young for evermore.
<lb/>None was more worshipful for manhood, throne,
<lb/>For diadem and knowledge. He possessed
<lb/>An archimage, Babak by name, a man
<lb/>Of wisdom, shrewd of heart, and fortunate,
<lb/>Made him the muster-master of the host,
<lb/>And bade him to prepare himself an office
<lb/>Of ample size before the palace-gate,
<lb/>And higher than its top, and furnish it
<lb/>With carpets that were worthy of a king
<lb/>To seat the clerks engaged upon the work.
<lb/>A proclamation issued from his office,
<lb/>And all the folk gave ear: <q>Famed warriors!
<lb/>Mount and attend the portal of the Shah,
<lb/>All ye that would have guerdon at his hands!
<lb/>With iron helmets set upon your heads,
<lb/>Arrayed in mail and bearing ox-head maces.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The troops came to the office of Babak,
<lb/>The air was darkened by the horsemen’s dust.
<lb/>Now when Babak reviewed the host he missed<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<pb n="231"/>

<lb/>The standard and the chief of all the noble.
<lb/>He left the office, mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And bade the soldiers go back to their quarters.
<lb/>The turning sky continued on its course,
<lb/>And when the radiant sun displayed its face
<lb/>It was proclaimed before the palace-gate:
<lb/><q>Ye mace-men of the army of Iran!
<lb/>Go all in full array with arms and bows
<lb/>And lassos to the office of Babak.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>They went with lances, helms, and coats of mail;
<lb/>The army’s dust ascended to the clouds.
<lb/>Babak looked round upon the host but, since
<lb/>The Shah appeared not in his Grace and state,
<lb/>Thus spake: <q>Return glad and victorious
<lb/>In love and duty, each man to his quarters.</q>
<lb/>Again the third day rose the proclamation:—
<lb/><q>Ye men of name, of Grace divine and wisdom!
<lb/>Let there not be one horseman of this host
<lb/>Without his helmet and cuirass of war,
<lb/>And let him come and pass before this gate,
<lb/>And see his name upon the muster-roll.
<lb/>Let those that are distinguished by a crown,
<lb/>By Grace, by majesty, and lofty fortunes,
<lb/>Know that this muster is without respect
<lb/>Of persons, reticence, and modesty.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The king of kings gave ear thereto and heeded
<lb/>The proclamation from Babak’s divan,
<lb/>Then smiling called for coat of mail and helm,
<lb/>And held erect the flag of majesty.
<lb/>The Shah, with iron helmet on his head,
<lb/>Proceeded to the office of Babak.
<lb/>The chain-mail hung down from his Roman helm,
<lb/>And was secured by many a fastening.
<lb/>Within his hand he had an ox-head mace,
<lb/>Within his belt four shafts of poplar-wood,
<lb/>A bow on arm and lasso on the saddle.
<pb n="232"/>

<lb/>While round his loins he had a golden girdle.
<lb/>He urged his charger, gripping with his thighs,
<lb/>And laid the massive mace upon his shoulder;
<lb/>Then, lightly wheeling both to left and right,
<lb/>Displayed both steed and rider to Babak,
<lb/>Who when he had inspected them approved,
<lb/>And, having come up to the king of kings,
<lb/>Said thus to him: <q>O Shah! mayst thou be blessed!
<lb/>May wisdom be the provand of thy soul!
<lb/>Thou hast adorned the kingdom’s face with justice,
<lb/>Such that with us 'tis thy memorial.
<lb/>What I have said was boldness from a slave,
<lb/>But never must thou turn from what is just;
<lb/>So now, I prithee, wheel thee to the right
<lb/>With all the skill whereof thou art the master.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan again urged on his steed
<lb/>To right and left as 'twere Azargashasp.
<lb/>Babak looked on amazed and oft invoked
<lb/>The Maker of the world. A horseman’s pay
<lb/>Ran from a thousand to two thousand drachms;
<lb/>Four thousand were the most that any had.
<lb/>Babak paid to the Shah just one drachm more.
<lb/>Then from the office-door 'twas cried: <q>Exhibit
<lb/>The charger of the first of warriors—
<lb/>The horseman of the world, the famous Shah,</q>
<lb/>While Nushirwan laughed heartily, for fortune
<lb/>Was young with him and he a youthful king.
<lb/>Now when Babak had left the royal office
<lb/>He came before the noble Shah and said:—
<lb/><q>Great Shah! if I, thy slave, made bold to-day
<lb/>The purpose of my heart was right and just:
<lb/>Let not the Shah take notice of my harshness;
<lb/>It is not harshness to discharge one’s duty,
<lb/>And blest is he who meant not to be harsh.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><q>O man of wisdom!</q> said the Shah to him,
<lb/><q>Keep thyself ever in the path of right,
<pb n="233"/>

<lb/>Whereof thou break’st the heart by self-regard.
<lb/>Know that thou art the dearer in mine eyes;
<lb/>But mine anxiety is for myself—
<lb/>How, when the army is engaged in fight,
<lb/>I shall comport myself upon the field.</q>
<lb/>Babak made answer to the noble Shah:—
<lb/><q>No crown and signet will behold thy like,
<lb/>While painter hath observed not limned in hall
<lb/>A hand and rein like thine, O king! Oh! may
<lb/>High heaven accord to thee thy full desire,
<lb/>Oh! may thy heart be glad, thyself unscathed!</q>
<lb/>Thus to the archimage said Nushirwan:—
<lb/><q>Our justice shall make old folk young again.
<lb/>The king must leave as his memorial
<lb/>Within the world but righteousness alone.
<lb/>What need have we for such a treasury,
<lb/>Such toil and greed, and to confine our soul
<lb/>Within this Wayside Inn? The need, since here
<lb/>Is no abiding, is to eat and drink.
<lb/>I have been troubled with the world’s affairs,
<lb/>Although I kept these matters to myself,
<lb/>Because my royal crown hath enemies,
<lb/>And Ahriman doth compass me about.
<lb/>Methought: <q>I will bring troops from every side,
<lb/>And summon warriors from every province,
<lb/>But for the levy I have need of treasure,
<lb/>Which I have but to labour to amass;
<lb/>Still if this bringeth evil on the poor
<lb/>I must refrain my heart from this desire.</q>
<lb/>So I revolved this matter in my heart,
<lb/>And, having come upon a wise resolve,
<lb/>I wrote a letter to the paladins,
<lb/>The mighty men, and prudent archimages,
<lb/>To all the nobles and the potentates
<lb/>In all the provinces, and thus it ran:—
<lb/><q>All ye possessed of wisdom and of sense!
<pb n="234"/>

<lb/>Bring up your sons for military service,
<lb/>Dispatch them to the field equipped for war,
<lb/>And look to me for honour and reward.
<lb/>They must be able to distinguish hand
<lb/>And rein from stirrup on the hills and dales,
<lb/>And learn to battle with the enemy
<lb/>With mace and scimitar, with bow and arrow,
<lb/>Because a youth unskilled availeth naught
<lb/>Although he be descended from Arish.</q><note>For whom see Vol. v. p. 12.</note>
<lb/>The muster-master went forth from the court,
<lb/>With money for the chiefs, to every province,
<lb/>And now in sooth I have adorned the face
<lb/>Of earth with men prepared to take the field.
<lb/>I have more knowledge, policy, and method
<lb/>Than former Shahs, and greater armaments.</q>
<lb/>The archmage, when he heard the Shah speak thus,
<lb/>Called praises down upon the crown and throne.
<lb/>The payment was delayed for forty days,
<lb/>And then the athelings, equipped for war,
<lb/>Went to the office and received their pay
<lb/>While joyance was the order of the day.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How Nushirwan harangued the Iranians, and how the
Kings acknowledged his Supremacy</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the sun displayed its shining face,
<lb/>When circling heaven unlocked the garden-gate,
<lb/>And when the Mound of Fenugreek appeared
<lb/>While dark night’s tresses vanished, Nushirwan,
<lb/>All smiles, glad-hearted, and of youthful fortune,
<lb/>Sat on his throne, while all that sought redress
<lb/>Flocked to his court. The king harangued them thus:—

<pb n="235"/>

<lb/><q>Acknowledge that ye have not any helper
<lb/>Save holy God, the Lord of all, our Guide,
<lb/>Who leadeth us in both worlds by the hand.
<lb/>Fear not the throne and crown, the court is open
<lb/>To all, and ye soe’er that come thereto
<lb/>By day and night keep not your lips from speech.
<lb/>If we are quaffing wine in company,
<lb/>Or busied with advisors, or at polo,
<lb/>Or on the hunting-field, the way is open
<lb/>For you to us. Let access be withheld
<lb/>From none because I am asleep, awake,
<lb/>At work or play. Let none of you withdraw
<lb/>From us to sleep with wants unsatisfied.
<lb/>My heart will be rejoiced and bright whenever
<lb/>I break the travail of the oppressed. Please God,
<lb/>No officer of mine, no man at arms,
<lb/>No servitor, shall sleep with heart aggrieved,
<lb/>For from his grievance harm will come on me.
<lb/>However trifling or obscure the matter
<lb/>The Maker will require it at my hands.
<lb/>For tolls and imposts, other than the archmages
<lb/>Are now concerned with in mine offices,
<lb/>No gold or silver shall be asked of you,
<lb/>So sleep all unafraid of me henceforth.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Then sunward from the face of earth applause
<lb/>Rose from the hall: <q>May Nushirwan have Grace,
<lb/>And all his years the crown of king of kings!
<lb/>Ne’er may the throne, the state, and famous crown
<lb/>Of sovereignty be void of him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They went
<lb/>Their ways, glad and rejoicing, and earth’s face
<lb/>Grew like the garden of Iram.<note n="1">See Vol. i. p. 100.</note>
<lb/>Thou hadst not
<lb/>Seen any one despondent in the world,
<lb/>While from the clouds came seasonable rain,
<lb/>The world resembled jocund Paradise,
<pb n="236"/>

<lb/>The clouds sowed tulips in the pleasances,
<lb/>The dales, the plains, and orchards shone like lamps,
<lb/>The uplands were like garths, garths like the sun.
<lb/>Thereafter tidings came to Rum and Hind:
<lb/><q>Iran is like fine painted silk of Rum;
<lb/>The Shah hath decked with armaments and justice
<lb/>The earth till it is like the shining moon.
<lb/>No one in all the world doth know the sum
<lb/>Of all his forces save the Shah himself.
<lb/>They all are blithe of heart and dight for war,
<lb/>Have fame and glory and illumine the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The kings of all the realms were sore amazed
<lb/>At heart; their souls were dark through Nushirwan.
<lb/>Ambassadors arrived from Hind and Chin,
<lb/>And all kings called down praises on the Shah;
<lb/>They saw that they could counter not his might,
<lb/>And hasted to pay tribute with good will,
<lb/>Bare them as underlords to Nushirwan,
<lb/>And gathered slaves and purses for his service.
<lb/>With golden maces and with golden crowns
<lb/>The envoys went upon their way. They reached
<lb/>The court-gate of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And brought the toll and tribute of their lords.
<lb/>The court appeared adorned like Paradise
<lb/>Through all those purses, slaves, and audience-seekers.
<lb/>Thus for a while the heavens turned above,
<lb/>Consorting with the Iranian king in love.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>How Nushirwan went round his Empire and built a Wall
in the Pass between Iran and Turan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan, the wise, made this resolve—
<lb/>That he would sojourn for a while abroad
<pb n="237"/>

<lb/>To make the circuit of the jocund world,
<lb/>And bring whate’er was hidden to the light.
<lb/>He beat the kettledrums, marched forth the host,
<lb/>And sun and moon were both astound at him.
<lb/>What with the troops and jewels, gold and silver,
<lb/>The golden girdles and the golden shields,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>No gold is left within
<lb/>The mines, no gems or lustrous pearls remain!</q>
<lb/>He led his host toward Khorasan at leisure,
<lb/>All heedful of Sassanian precedent.
<lb/>Whenever he passed settlements he pitched
<lb/>His camp and camp-enclosure on the waste,
<lb/>And when the blare of clarions rose there went
<lb/>A herald first afoot who thus proclaimed:
<lb/><q>Ye subjects of the monarch of the world!
<lb/>Is any privily aggrieved at us?
<lb/>Sleep not despairing of the Shah, allow not
<lb/>Your souls to fail with care.</q>
<lb/>He led the host
<lb/>Thus to Gurgan and bore with him the crown
<lb/>And throne of chiefs. Know, justice is no loss:
<lb/>Shahs should have prowess, rede, and noble birth.
<lb/>Now when the nightingales were full of song
<lb/>They went thence toward Sari and toward Amul,
<lb/>Where hill and plain were clothed with forest-trees,
<lb/>Which filled the Iranian monarch’s heart with thought.
<lb/>He left the plain and mounting to the heights,
<lb/>Still seated on his Arab bay looked out
<lb/>O’er mountain and o’er forest, and observed
<lb/>Rose, hyacinth and game, and water there,
<lb/>And thus he said: <q>O Thou almighty Judge,
<lb/>The World-lord, Conqueror, and Fosterer!
<lb/>Thou art the Maker of the sun and moon,
<lb/>The Guide and the Revealer of the way.
<lb/>Thou mad’st the world of such delightsomeness
<lb/>That we distinguish not 'twixt earth and Heaven.
<pb n="238"/>

<lb/>Whoe’er shall worship any save Thyself
<lb/>Will send his soul to Hell. It was for this
<lb/>That pious Faridun forwent Iran,
<lb/>And made his dwelling here, so passing fair
<lb/>Is this place and delightsome to the heart,
<lb/>Where water is rose-water and the soil
<lb/>Is spicery.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O righteous judge!
<lb/>If this were not a highway for the Turkmans
<lb/>Our hearts would be not empty of delight,
<lb/>Such are the wealth and glory of this place;
<lb/>But as it is we cannot raise our necks
<lb/>For constant murders, sack, and harryings.
<lb/>There are not many left or even few
<lb/>Of fowl or men or cattle on this spot.
<lb/>This is the only route between the realms,
<lb/>And causes loss to the Iranian folk.
<lb/>There came much toil and strife in former times,
<lb/>But then the Turkman route was through Kharazm.
<lb/>Now for the merchant or the thane to raise
<lb/>His head would be in vain. However, now
<lb/>That thou hast led an army to these parts,
<lb/>Avert this ill from us and bar the way.
<lb/>Thy treasures will be more, not less, thereby:
<lb/>Now is the time to render us a service.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, whenas he heard the supplicant,
<lb/>Showered tear-drops from his eyes and thereupon
<lb/>Addressed his minister and said to him:
<lb/><q>A very grievous toil confronteth us.
<lb/>Henceforth 'tis not for us to fare and feast,
<lb/>Or even tender our own crown, for God
<lb/>Will sanction not the wrong in us that we
<lb/>Shall be in happiness while thanes are grieving.
<lb/>Such mountains as these are, such spacious plains,
<lb/>All fit for gardens, grounds, and palaces,
<lb/>And filled with cattle, game, and running water,
<pb n="239"/>

<lb/>So that the soul is freshened by the sight—
<lb/>We must not let the Turkmans lay them waste,
<lb/>And desolate the country of Iran.
<lb/>My kingly office, prudence, policy,
<lb/>Humanity itself, will brook it not.
<lb/>Men will invoke not blessings on our heads
<lb/>What time Iran is lying desolate.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He bade his minister: <q>From Hind and Rum
<lb/>Select men famous in those cultured lands
<lb/>From all the provinces, foreseeing men,
<lb/>Such masters in their craft as thou canst find,
<lb/>And build me from the sea a lofty wall,
<lb/>On broad foundations and ten lassos high,
<lb/>Of stone and mortar, starting from the deep,
<lb/>And rising to the fountain of the sun.
<lb/>In this way surely we shall form a bar,
<lb/>And loss from foes will come not on Iran.
<lb/>Use no forced labour, open our treasury,
<lb/>And pay to every one what he demandeth.
<lb/>The labourer, the thane, and man of birth
<lb/>Must not be incommoded by the blast.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He made an old archmage the overseer,
<lb/>And shut out all the desert by the wall,
<lb/>Wherein they set a mighty iron door,
<lb/>And all the flock grew fearless of the wolf.
<lb/>Of frontier-guards he stationed many a post,
<lb/>And, having made all safe, led on the host.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>How Nushirwan chastised the Alans and the Men of
Baluch and Gilan<note n="1">Literally, <gloss>rubbed the ears of.</gloss></note></head>
<p>
<lb/>Thence from the sea he went toward the Alans,
<lb/>And finding there a ravaged, barren march
<pb n="240"/>

<lb/>He thus addressed his chiefs: <q>It is a shame
<lb/>For regions in Iran to lie thus waste,
<lb/>And we must suffer not our foes to say so.</q>
<lb/>He chose an envoy from among the troops,
<lb/>One, as was fitting, wise and eloquent,
<lb/>To whom he said: <q>Depart hence with the dawn,
<lb/>And say thus to the marchlords of yon folk:
<lb/><q>From mine intelligencers have I heard
<lb/>All that hath passed in public and in private,
<lb/>And that ye say: <q>Why fear we Nushirwan?
<lb/>As for Iran it is a pinch of dust.</q>

<lb/>Now have we come anigh you and set up
<lb/>Our camp, our camp-enclosures, and our court.
<lb/>Your wastes are spacious and your mountains high,
<lb/>Your troops are armed with arrow, mace, and lasso.
<lb/>Your gorges are the place for ambuscades,
<lb/>Land, mountain, field and fell, are all your own.
<lb/>We—general and soldiers—challenge you,
<lb/>We who are strangers in a foreign land.</q></q>
<lb/>The envoy went his way and spake the words
<lb/>Dictated by the monarch of Iran.
<lb/>The host of the Alans assembled—all
<lb/>The great, the sages, and the counsellors—
<lb/>A host that found employ in pillaging,
<lb/>And recked but little for the Iranians.
<lb/>Iran was wont to stand in awe of them:
<lb/>Folk had no raiment, gold, or silver left,
<lb/>And men and women with their babes and beasts
<lb/>Were wont to quit their homes and seek the plains.
<lb/>The envoy told the Alans, withholding naught,
<lb/>The message of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Whereat the faces of the chiefs grew black;
<lb/>The words of Nushirwan amazed their hearts.
<lb/>The great men and the chieftains of that march
<lb/>Went forth with contributions and much tribute,
<lb/>With slaves and raiment, and with gold and silver,
<pb n="241"/>

<lb/>And many a noble steed, while of the folk
<lb/>All that were men of years and eloquence,
<lb/>And wisdom-seekers, came to Nushirwan,
<lb/>Bewailing their past doings. When they reached
<lb/>The tent-enclosure of the Shah with presents,
<lb/>And gifts, they cried and wallowed in the dust,
<lb/>Their eyes fulfilled with tears, their hearts with blood.
<lb/>For shame and self-excusing is no need
<lb/>When wisdom and the valiant are agreed.
<lb/>The prudent Shah was gracious unto them,
<lb/>And pardoned all that they had done amiss;
<lb/>Then ordered that upon the wasted lands—
<lb/>The lurking-place of lion and of leopard—
<lb/>They should erect a city with all speed,
<lb/>With room for sowing and for harvesting,
<lb/>The whole surrounded by a lofty wall
<lb/>That ill might not befall from enemies.
<lb/>The Alans made answer to the noble king,
<lb/>And said: <q>With earrings on as slaves of thine,
<lb/>And, as the Shah hath bidden, we will raise
<lb/>The ramparts of a noble seat.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah
<lb/>Marched thence to Hindustan and sojourned there.
<lb/>At his commandment all folk came to him,
<lb/>Came seeking to ingratiate themselves,
<lb/>And for two miles beside the Indus-bank
<lb/>Were horses, elephants, brocade, and coin.
<lb/>The great men all with honesty of heart
<lb/>And loyalty appeared before the Shah,
<lb/>Who questioned them and well entreated them,
<lb/>And placed them in accordance to their rank.
<lb/>With jocund heart the Shah departed thence:
<lb/>Troops, steeds, and elephants fulfilled the world.
<lb/>He went his way, and tidings came to him:
<lb/><q>The world is wasted by the Baluchis,
<lb/>Till from exceeding slaughter, pillaging,
<pb n="242"/>

<lb/>And harrying, the earth is overwhelmed,
<lb/>But greater ruin cometh from Gilan,
<lb/>And curses banish blessings.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the heart
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, the Shah, was sorrowful,
<lb/>And grief commingled with his joy. He said
<lb/>To the Iranians: <q>The Alans and Hind
<lb/>Were, in their terror of our scimitars,
<lb/>Like silk. Now our own realm is turned against us:
<lb/>Shall we hunt lions and forgo the sheep?</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>One said to him: <q>The garden hath no rose
<lb/>Without a thorn, O king! So too these marches
<lb/>Are ever troublesome and treasure-wasting.
<lb/>As for Baluch the glorious Ardeshir
<lb/>Tried it with all his veteran officers,
<lb/>But all his stratagems and artifices,
<lb/>His feints, his labours, arms, and fighting failed,
<lb/>And though the enterprise succeeded ill
<lb/>He cloaked the failure even to himself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>This story of the thane enraged the Shah,
<lb/>Who went upon his way toward Baluch.
<lb/>Now when he drew anigh those lofty mountains
<lb/>He went around them with his retinue,
<lb/>And all his host encircled them about,
<lb/>And barred the passage e’en to wind and ant.
<lb/>The troops, like ants and locusts, occupied
<lb/>The mountain-outskirts to the sandy desert.
<lb/>A herald went his rounds about the host,
<lb/>Proclaiming from the mountains, caves, and plains:
<lb/><q>Whene’er the Baluchis are seeking food,
<lb/>If they be warriors and carry arms,
<lb/>However many or however few,
<lb/>Let not a single one of them escape.</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>The troops, aware of the anger of the Shah,
<lb/>Stopped every outlet with their horse and foot;
<lb/>Few of the Baluchis or none survived,
<pb n="243"/>

<lb/>No women, children, warriors, were left.
<lb/>All of them perished by the scimitar,
<lb/>And all their evil doings had an end,
<lb/>The world had quiet from their ravaging:
<lb/>No Baluchi, seen or unseen, remained,
<lb/>While on their mountains, so it came to pass,
<lb/>The herds thenceforward strayed without a guard;
<lb/>Alike on waste and lofty mountain-top
<lb/>The sheep required no shepherd. All the folk
<lb/>Around thought nothing of past sufferings,
<lb/>And looked on vale and mountain as their home.
<lb/>Thence toward Gilan marched Nushirwan, for there,
<lb/>And in Daylam, was trouble manifest.
<lb/>The army stretched from sea to mountain-top,
<lb/>The air was full of flags, the earth of troops.
<lb/>The army was extended round Gilan,
<lb/>And light departed from the sun and moon.
<lb/>Thus spake the Shah: <q>Among the small and great
<lb/>No trace of Wolf and Lion must be left.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So mighty was the slaughter in the land
<lb/>That all the region’s face was bathed in blood.
<lb/>At all the slaying, pillaging, and burning
<lb/>The men and women sent up wails of woe.
<lb/>On every side the slain were piled in heaps,
<lb/>The grasses smirched with brains. The warriors—
<lb/>The just, the prudent, and the men of weight—
<lb/>Remaining in Gilan bound their own hands,
<lb/>And with their women-folk behind, their children
<lb/>Before them, came lamenting to the king
<lb/>With bosoms rent and dust upon their heads.
<lb/>They all assembled at the monarch’s court
<lb/>With bounden hands and wounded bodies, saying:
<lb/><q>We have turned back upon our evil courses;
<lb/>Oh! that the Shah would cease from his displeasure!
<lb/>If he is vexed at heart against Gilan
<lb/>We will behead ourselves with our own hands.
<pb n="244"/>

<lb/>It may be that the Shah then will relent
<lb/>When he shall see the heaps of severed heads.</q>
<lb/>When such a cry rose from the court, and when
<lb/>The Shah had listened to their supplication,
<lb/>He pardoned them; the past was blotted out,
<lb/>But he required two hundred hostages
<lb/>Both from Gilan and from Daylam that none
<lb/>Thereafter might pursue the path of ill.
<lb/>He left a paladin with them to stay,
<lb/>And, having ordered all things, marched away.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><head>How Munzir, the Arab, came to Nushirwan for Succour
against the Injustice of Caesar</head>
<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1634"/>
<lb/>Next from Gilan he marched toward Madain,
<lb/>Not knowing his troops’ number or extent.<note n="1">They were so many.</note>
<lb/>Now as he journeyed on appeared afar
<lb/>A boundless host of wielders of the spear.
<lb/>A cavalier—one of that great array—
<lb/>Approached as quick as dust on their behalf,
<lb/>And, having lighted from his charger, said:
<lb/><q>Behold Munzir the Arab.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When Munzir
<lb/>Drew near the Shah all chiefs made way for him.
<lb/>The Shah saluted him with signs of joy,
<lb/>And brightened at his looks. That veteran
<lb/>Set loose his tongue, discoursed of Rum and Caesar,
<lb/>And said: <q>If thou art monarch of Iran,
<lb/>The guardian and the backbone of the brave,
<lb/>Why do the Romans lord it so and prance
<lb/>Upon the desert of the cavaliers?
<lb/>While if the Shah be Caesar’s overlord
<pb n="245"/>

<lb/>That haughty potentate should lose his head.
<lb/>Now if the noble Shah will give permission
<lb/>No more will he behold us asking aid,
<lb/>And in the fight the horsemen of the desert
<lb/>Shall triumph o’er the cavaliers of Rum.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah was wroth that Caesar should exalt
<lb/>His crown, as said Munzir, and, having chosen
<lb/>Among the troops a man of eloquence,
<lb/>And learned in Caesar’s tongue, said thus: <q>Go thou
<lb/>To Rum, take not thine ease in peopled parts,
<lb/>And say to Caesar: <q>If thou lackest wisdom
<lb/>Thy brains will sorrow for thy policy.
<lb/>The warrior-lion chasing onager
<lb/>Will batten on them even in a salt-marsh.
<lb/>For thee to have thy just dues from Munzir
<lb/>Sufficeth seeing that Vega is his throne.
<lb/>Discern then 'twixt thy left hand and thy right,
<lb/>And, when thou knowest, claim what march is thine.
<lb/>Since I am the distributor of lands
<lb/>And realms, am highest in the world and chief,
<lb/>My conduct shall be worthy of myself:
<lb/>I will let not the wind blow on Munzir.
<lb/>Since thou hast stretched thy hand upon the Arabs
<lb/>In fight take privy heed for thine own self.
<lb/>Moreover all that sovereignty is mine,
<lb/>And mine is all between the Bull<note n="1">See Vol. i. p. 71. </note>

<p>
<lb/>The ambassador came forth from Nushirwan
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1635"/>
<lb/>As 'twere a torrent, came and gave the message
<lb/>To Caesar, but that worthless one recoiled
<lb/>From what was just, replied evasively,
<lb/>Imagining a fall from power remote,
<lb/>And answered thus: <q>As for that fool Munzir,
<lb/>Take what he stateth at its proper worth.
<pb n="246"/>

<lb/>If he complaineth out of wantonness,
<lb/>Exaggerating thus the evil done,
<lb/>Or if a single man complain within
<lb/>The desert of the wielders of the spear,
<lb/>I will convert the heights of earth to breadths,
<lb/>And that unwatered desert to a sea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The envoy heard, came swift as dust, and told
<lb/>The words of Caesar. Nushirwan enraged
<lb/>Said to his minister: <q>The brains of Caesar
<lb/>Are wedded not to wisdom. I will show him
<lb/>Who hath authority, the power to conquer
<lb/>The world, to levy war, and make a pact.
<lb/>His overweening and his haughtiness,
<lb/>His labour, pillaging, and harrying,
<lb/>He shall repent more dearly than the drunkard,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>That thrusteth both hands in the fire at night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He then bade blow the trumpets, and a host
<lb/>Was gathered unto him from every side;
<lb/>The din of tymbals went up from the court-gate,
<lb/>Earth was pitch-hued and air was ebony.
<lb/>He chose of cavaliers from that famed host
<lb/>A hundred thousand armed with scimitars,
<lb/>Entrusted that great army to Munzir,
<lb/>And bade him: <q>From the desert of the spearmen

<lb/>The world-lord and successor of Kavad,<note n="2">Cf. p. 179, note.</note>
<lb/>To Caesar, the exalted lord of Rum—
<lb/>Guard of the marches of that prosperous land.</q>
<lb/>The letter opened with the praise of God
<lb/>From whom alone all greatness must be sought—
<lb/><q>The Master of the circling sun and moon,
<lb/>The Source of victory and mastery,
<lb/>Who is above the will of turning heaven
<lb/>As touching justice, love, and strife. Though thou
<lb/>Art Caesar and the lord of Rum, dispute not
<lb/>Aught with the Arabs, for if thou shalt take
<lb/>The sheep out of the clutches of the wolf
<lb/>Thou wilt, as thou art ware, have grievous toil;
<lb/>While if thou sendest troops against Munzir
<lb/>I will not leave thee host or crown or throne.
<lb/>If any underling grow masterful
<lb/>He shall be punished by our scimitar.
<lb/>Step not a single cubit past thy bounds
<lb/>If thou desirest that our pact shall stand.
<lb/>If thou shalt pass thy bounds, we will pass ours,
<lb/>And trample under foot thy head and throne.
<lb/>The greeting of the lord of diadem
<lb/>And might to those that seek not to cause trouble
<lb/>By their injustice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Unto this they set
<lb/>The Shah’s seal and then chose a cavalier,
<lb/>Such as was needful, from the court, a man
<lb/>Persuasive, valiant, shrewd, and veteran.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><head>How the Letter of Nushirwan reached Caesar and how
he replied</head>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy with the letter of the king
<lb/>Came to famed Caesar, gave it, greeted him,
<lb/>And told him all the mind of Nushirwan.
<lb/>When Caesar heard and had perused the letter
<lb/>He writhed and was astound. His brow grew wrinkled,
<lb/>His visage wan at what the exalted Shah
<lb/>Had said. He called a scribe, wrote his reply,
<lb/>And made his meaning clear for good and ill.
<lb/>The letter first grew musky with the ink
<lb/>What time he offered praise to God almighty—
<lb/><q>The Artist of the heavens over us,
<lb/>The Source of warfare, peace, and amity.
<lb/>He giveth in the world one man a crown
<lb/>With slaves before him better than himself.
<lb/>Though turning heaven itself be under thee,
<lb/>And Jupiter beneath thy scimitar,
<lb/>Search out thy records, for no son of Rum
<lb/>E’er hath paid tribute to thy royal race.
<lb/>King as thou art I am no less than thou;
<lb/>I too possess a head, a crown, and realm.
<lb/>Why must I take so much abuse in fear
<lb/>Of foot of elephant or din of drum?
<lb/>I now ask you for tribute and for toll,
<lb/>And who is there with power to fight with Rum?
<lb/>The doings of Sikandar in Iran
<lb/>Thou knowest, and we claim that noble Shah.
<lb/>Sikandar’s sword is still in evidence,
<lb/>Why pickest thou a quarrel with us thus?
<lb/>The javelin-wielding horsemen of the waste
<lb/>Have pillaged our possessions in their raids:
<lb/>No longer will we bear their wrongs but raise
<pb n="249"/>

<lb/>The dust in all their borders. Nushirwan
<lb/>Was neither Maker of the sun, nor hath
<lb/>He seized the key of the revolving sky,
<lb/>That there must be no other king of kings,
<lb/>And his will only current in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave the envoy no reply in speech,
<lb/>Not recking of the wrath of Nushirwan,
<lb/>But, when he set the seal upon the letter,
<lb/>He spake these words: <q>Christ and the Cross are with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The envoy spent no breath on him, perceiving
<lb/>With grief the answer, and with grief departed;
<lb/>Swift as a dust-cloud to the Shah he sped,
<lb/>And told him all that Caesar purposed.
</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><head>How Nushirwan went to war with Caesar</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king, when he had read the letter, raged
<lb/>Against the turn of fortune. Then he called
<lb/>The archmages and the chieftains, one and all,
<lb/>And spake to them at large about that letter.
<lb/>He sat for three days with his counsellors
<lb/>And paladins—the shatterers of hosts—
<lb/>And on the fourth day was resolved to lead
<lb/>His troops to fight with Caesar. At the gate
<lb/>Arose the blare of trumpets with the din
<lb/>Of brazen cymbals and of drums. He paused not,
<lb/>But went to battle in a righteous cause,
<lb/>Assembled troops, made up the baggage-train,
<lb/>And called on God, the Giver of all good.
<lb/>A dust rose such that thou hadst said: <q>The sky
<lb/>Hath smirched its visage in a sea of pitch!</q></p>

<p>He clad the surface of the earth with horse-shoes,
<pb n="250"/>
<lb/>While silken flags incarnadined the air.
<lb/>There was no room on earth e’en for a gnat,
<lb/>No room for wind left in the firmament.
<lb/>The hubbub of the horsemen and the dust
<lb/>Of elephants made earth seem like the Nile.
<lb/>The world-lord marched with Kéwa’s flag, with crown,
<lb/>And golden boots. The army’s din was heard
<lb/>Two miles away. Before the host were drums
<lb/>And elephants, and on this wise the Shah,
<lb/>With chiefs behind him and with chiefs before him,
<lb/>Sped onward to Azar Abédagan.
<lb/>Now when his eyes beheld Azargashasp
<lb/>Afar he lighted down and went afoot,
<lb/>Requested of his pious minister
<lb/>The sacred twigs and bathed his cheeks with tears.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1638"/>
<lb/>He made his entry of the Fane of Fire
<lb/>With wailing. They set up a throne inlaid
<lb/>With gold, and spread thereon the Zandavasta,
<lb/>Wherefrom an archimagus read aloud,
<lb/>According to the ritual, while priests
<lb/>And chieftains wallowed in the dust before it,
<lb/>And rent their skirts. The great men showered jewels
<lb/>Upon the book and muttered laud thereon.
<lb/>The Shah approaching offered praise and prayer
<lb/>Before the Maker of the world, and asked
<lb/>For victory, for mastery, and guidance
<lb/>Upon the path of justice. He bestowed
<lb/>Gifts on the attendants and on mendicants
<lb/>Wherever seen. He pitched his tent before
<lb/>The Fire-fane, and his troops arrayed their ranks
<lb/>Upon each side. He called a prudent scribe,
<lb/>Discoursed at large, dictating fitting words,
<lb/>Bade him address by letter graciously
<lb/>The marchlords of the country of Iran,
<lb/>And say: <q>Fear God, be vigilant, and guard
<lb/>The world against the enemy. Ye lords
<pb n="251"/>
<lb/>And paladins! be just to those beneath you,
<lb/>And keep such forces as will foil the foe.
<lb/>None while my standard shall be out of sight
<lb/>Must think to slumber in security.</q></p>

<p>As from the Fane of Fire he marched towards Rum
<lb/>The bruit of him was spread throughout the land,
<lb/>And all the faithful lieges flocked to him
<lb/>Until the warriors<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/> hid the fields and fells,
<lb/>And many an aspirant came with gifts
<lb/>And offerings to the king. Where’er he lighted
<lb/>There reached him salutations and addresses
<lb/>From all sides, while where’er he led his host
<lb/>He still had feast and chase before his eyes,
<lb/>And ’twas the custom for a thousand chiefs
<lb/>To come each night to banquet with the king.
<lb/>When he was near the frontier he made ready
<lb/>For war and in the first place paid his troops.
<lb/>His general was Shirwi, son of Bakram—
<lb/>A man of rede and self-possessed in battle.
<lb/>He gave the army’s left wing to Farhad,
<lb/>To whom he proffered many prudent counsels.
<lb/>Ust 4d, son of Barzin, was on the right,
<lb/>Garshasp, the atheling, was o’er the baggage.
<lb/>Mihran<note n="2">Cf. p. 185.</note>
<lb/> was at the centre, for his heart
<lb/>Was steadfast in the fray. The outpost duty
<lb/>The Shah gave to Hurmuz, son of Kharrad,
<lb/>Enjoining wisdom to his soul and heart,
<lb/>While everywhere intelligencers went
<lb/>That nothing might be hidden. Then the Shah
<lb/>Called and advised his veterans much and well.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1639"/>
<lb/>He said to them: <q>Ye numbers numberless
<lb/>Of men of high estate and warriors!
<lb/>If any one of you shall quit my way,
<lb/>Or draw a breath without my privity,
<lb/>Shall cause affliction to the mendicants,
<lb/>Or to the mighty men possessed of treasure,
<lb/>Shall injure any tree that beareth fruit,
<lb/>Or do an act unseemly, trample down
<lb/>The cornfields, or leave station to advance
<lb/>Before the troops, I swear by God, the Lord
<lb/>Of Mars, of Saturn, and of Sol, who gave me
<lb/>The diadem and might, forthwith to cleave him
<lb/>Asunder with my sword though like a star
<lb/>He hide him in the clouds. I am the scout
<lb/>Before the host, aspirant, central stay,
<lb/>Guard of the elephants, of troops, and baggage,
<lb/>Am now upon the left, now on the right.
<lb/>I fare o’er land and sea, I seek no rest
<lb/>And sleep in war.</q>
<lb/>A herald named Shirzéd
<lb/>Laid up at heart the words of Nushirwan,
<lb/>And made in haste the circuit of the host,
<lb/>Went round about tent and pavilion,
<lb/>And cried: <q>Ye troops in numbers numberless!
<lb/>The bidding of the watchful Shah is this:
<lb/>Whoever, save in justice, love, and wisdom,
<lb/>Shall look upon this gloomy earth of ours,
<lb/>Men shall pour out his blood thereon as one
<lb/>That hath departed from the will of God.</q>
<lb/>A proclamation did not satisfy
<lb/>The Shah who night and day employed himself
<lb/>In going on his rounds about the host,
<lb/>Observing everything both good and bad,
<lb/>Receiving tidings of the world’s affairs,
<lb/>And slighting nothing whether good or ill.
<lb/>When any soldier died upon the march
<lb/>The Shah prepared a charnel at the place,
<lb/>And all the man’s belongings—silver, gold,
<lb/>His bow, his helm, his lasso and his belt,
<lb/>Or good or bad, were buried with the dead,
<lb/>Who in the grave had still his goods with him.
<pb n="253"/>
<lb/>The world was lost in wonder at the height
<lb/>Of majesty attained by Nushirwan.
<lb/>In every place where he engaged in battle
<lb/>He showed his counsel, caution, and good sense,
<lb/>And used to call a trusty messenger,
<lb/>Who went to foes preparing for resistance,
<lb/>And if they entered on the path of right
<lb/>The wise Shah treated them with clemency;
<lb/>But, if they fought, that valiant Crocodile
<lb/>Was very wroth, went forth to fight with them,
<lb/>And gave their fields and crops to spoil. He wooed
<lb/>The world with justice and the scimitar.
<lb/>The conduct of the Shah was like the sun’s,
<lb/>Which shineth in its course on wet and dry,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1640"/>
<lb/>Denying unto none its radiance,
<lb/>When banishing the clouds from circling heaven,
<lb/>But giving all its justice and its bounty,
<lb/>Its hue and scent, its lustrous pearls and waters,
<lb/>Obscuring unto none its light and height,
<lb/>But joying hearts and simply shining on.
<lb/>The king of kings by justice, policy,
<lb/>And Grace took all the world beneath his wings;
<lb/>Both war and bounty were mere play to him,
<lb/>And thus it was that he attained his greatness.
<lb/>Confronted by the elephant and lion
<lb/>He ne’er deferred the combat for a day,
<lb/>And when a foe was instant to appear
<lb/>In helm and mail before the host for fight,
<lb/>Him would they slaughter or in scorn would fling
<lb/>Bound in the dungeons of the conquering king.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><head>How Nushirwan took divers Strongholds in his
March to Rum</head>
<p>
<lb/>He marched upon this wise until he reached
<lb/>A busy city which was named Shitrab,
<lb/>Wherein Gushtasp dwelt when he went to Rum.<note>See Vol. iv. p. 325.</note>
<lb/>The Shah beheld it rising in the air,
<lb/>Fulfilled with men and goods, with harp and song,
<lb/>With stone-foundations springing from the deep,
<lb/>And battlements up-builded to the clouds.
<lb/>The troops beleaguered it but saw no means
<lb/>Of access to the gate. The Shah set up
<lb/>The catapults on all four sides, and then
<lb/>The ramparts of the Christian crumbled down.
<lb/>From every quarter came the breath of doom;
<lb/>Men saw no place of refuge or escape,
<lb/>And when the shining sun set in the sky
<lb/>The castle-walls were level with the plain.
<lb/>The shouts of cavaliers, the dust of troops,
<lb/>And fume of fire ascended to the moon.
<lb/>The stronghold was all trunkless heads and feet,
<lb/>Elsewhere were headless trunks. The cries for quarter,
<lb/>And women’s shrieks, rose o’er the drummers’ din.
<lb/>The magnates eminent for wealth or valour
<lb/>They bound and laid upon the elephants,
<lb/>While wails of woe and cries for quarter rose.
<lb/>The Shah spared none in battle-tide, he spared not
<lb/>His treasures and dinars in banquet-time.
<lb/>He marched thence till another hold appeared,
<lb/>Wherein were Caesar’s treasures, and it had
<lb/>A mighty man for castellan. Twas called
<lb/>Ardyish-i-Rum till that Nushirwan
<milestone unit="calced" n="1645"/>
<lb/>Ill-ended it. The watchful Shah surveyed
<pb n="255"/>
<lb/>That hold, unentered yet by hostile troops,
<lb/>And bade shoot showers of arrows till the air
<lb/>Was thick with them as 'tis with hail in spring.
<lb/>The chieftains bravely stormed the walls and flung
<lb/>Fire on the city and the citadel,
<lb/>Wherein no living thing remained alive
<lb/>Or, in the country round, a thorn or briar.
<lb/>The Shah gave Caesar’s treasures up to spoil,
<lb/>And all the crowns and purses to his troops.
<lb/>He brought the Day of Doom upon that city,
<lb/>And all folk fled. Men, women, children, wailed
<lb/>Till old and young assembling came before
<lb/>The noble Shah and cried aloud for succour:—
<lb/><q>The ministers, the treasurers, and treasure,
<lb/>Are thine, and thine the gain and toil in Rum;
<lb/>We only beg of thee to spare our lives,
<lb/>We bondslaves of the Glory of thy crown.</q>
<lb/>The Shah bade cease the slaughtering, and he
<lb/>Provided for these people bounteously.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>The Battle of Nushirwan with Farfuriyus, the Leader of Caesar’s
Host, the Victory of Nushirwan, and his Capture of Kaliniyus and Antakiya</head>
<p>
<lb/>Departing thence the Shah led on his troops,
<lb/>And left Ardyish-i-Rum in his rear.
<lb/>One came and told him: <q>Caesar hath dispatched
<lb/>A host and lo! it draweth nigh.</q></p>

<p>On hearing
<lb/>Of that great power's approach—all spears and mail—
<lb/>The Shah proclaimed the tidings to the troops
<lb/>That all the host might be prepared. They marched
<lb/>As 'twere an iron mountain; battle-cries
<pb n="256"/>
<lb/>Ascended and the blast of clarions.
<lb/>A courier with tidings from the scouts
<lb/>Appeared before the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And told him: <q>Caesar hath dispatched an army
<lb/>Formed of his famous men and warriors.
<lb/>Their leader is a mighty paladin,
<lb/>Whose name in Ruman is Farfuriyus—
<lb/>A haughty cavalier with trump and drum—
<lb/>And all his troops long for the fight like wolves.</q></p>

<p>While thus he spake before the watchful Shah
<lb/>The dust-clouds of the advancing host appeared.
<lb/>He smiled and answered thus the messenger:—
<lb/><q>The thing is not unknown to us, for we
<lb/>Already have prepared the host for battle:
<lb/>Such thoughts ne'er have been absent from our minds.</q></p>

<p>Then with his lips afoam he gave command
<lb/>That all the army should draw up in line.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1642"/> So host with host confronted, and the air
<lb/>Was hindered in its passage by the dust.
<lb/>It was a glorious gathering of troops,
<lb/>Proud chiefs and wielders of the scimitar,
<lb/>All with loins tightly girded for the fray—
<lb/>The great, the sages, and the seed of kings.
<lb/>The swords of all were reeking with fresh blood,
<lb/>And trenchant of the clouds. The enemy
<lb/>Had no more respite than the quarry hath
<lb/>From leopard springing. Ruman slain lay heaped
<lb/>On all sides while the wounded turned from fight.
<lb/>Farfuriyus himself thus stricken fled
<lb/>The field with banner rent and drums o'erthrown.
<lb/>The horsemen of Iran like pards, when they
<lb/>Clutch on the waste the mountain-sheep, pursued
<lb/>The Romans, sweeping them from dale and desert.
<lb/>The Shah marched on again equipped for war,
<lb/>The soldiers all with mace and sword in hand.
<lb/>He led his army on along a plain
<pb n="257"/>
<lb/>Until another lofty hold appeared—
<lb/>A citadel with soldiers, trump, and drum,
<lb/>And hight Kaliniyus. The eagle saw not
<lb/>Its battlements, a full moat girdled it,
<lb/>And all around it stretched a fair domain
<lb/>Of halls and gardens, grounds and palaces.
<lb/>Twas strongly garrisoned by Roman troops—
<lb/>All famous men and eager for the fight.
<lb/>The Shah encamped his powers two leagues away,
<lb/>Earth blackened with the dust-clouds of the host,
<lb/>And war-cries went up from Kaliniyus—
<lb/>A clamour that bedwarfed the tymbals’ din.
<lb/>The Shah marked well that city whereunto
<lb/>His troops for ever thronged increasingly;
<lb/>They battled at the gates and showered down
<lb/>Their shafts and hand-grenades, and when bright Sol
<lb/>'Gan pale, and half revolving heaven was dark,
<lb/>No portion of the castle-walls remained:
<lb/>That city was all level with the ground.
<lb/>Then from the Shah's gate proclamation issued:—
<lb/><q>Ye famous men of the Iranian host!
<lb/>Come from the city, every man, and pass
<lb/>The night upon the plain. If any cry
<lb/>Shall rise from women and from aged folk,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Or any sound of pillage, rioting,
<lb/>And combating, shall reach mine ears at nights
<lb/>So that but one complain of evil usage,
<lb/>As soon as such appealeth ye shall see
<lb/>The skin of the offender stuffed with hay.</q><note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 359.</note>
<lb/>When Sol was stretching out its hand from Cancer,
<lb/>Had put away fatigue and banished sleep,
<lb/>The tymbals sounded at the monarch's gate,
<lb/>Those that were highest in esteem set forth,

<milestone unit="calced" n="1643"/>
<lb/>And from that hold and seat the men and women
<lb/>Assembled at the gate of Nushirwan:

<pb n="258"/>
<lb/><q>No cavalier of all our warriors
<lb/>Is left,</q> they said, <q>or magnate in this city;
<lb/>They all, though guiltless, have been slain or wounded
<lb/>And it is time for pardon from the Shah,
<lb/>Because God's justice never will approve
<lb/>That women, babes, and elders should be captive.
<lb/>The citadel and city's walls are such
<lb/>That henceforth thou wilt see but thorn-brakes here.
<lb/>Since Caesar was the offender how are we—
<lb/>The people of Kaliniyus—to blame?</q>
<lb/>The Shah gave pardon to those Romans: both
<lb/>The guilty and the innocent escaped.
<lb/>He left with them an ample store of wealth,
<lb/>And marched his army with all speed away;
<lb/>But all the folk that he saw fit for arms
<lb/>They bound on elephants and carried off.
<lb/>Then news to Antakiya came: <q>The Shah
<lb/>Is on his way with elephants and troops.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now at that city was a boundless host
<lb/>Of Roman warriors and mighty men.
<lb/>The Shah accorded to them three days’ grace
<lb/>That he might war not on them wrongfully,
<lb/>But on the fourth his host came mountain-like—
<lb/>The warriors of Iran in close array—
<lb/>While for the sake of women, children, land,
<lb/>And wealth the cavaliers of Rome advanced.
<lb/>They fought three mighty battles in three days,
<lb/>But on the fourth day when the sun arose
<lb/>The marches of that prosperous land lay open,
<lb/>The Iranians saw no Roman cavaliers,
<lb/>The soldiers took possession of the place,
<lb/>And filled it till there was no room to stand.
<lb/>The great men that had thrones and coronets,
<lb/>And those that were the treasurers of Caesar,
<lb/>Gave up the treasure to the Shah—the world-lord—
<lb/>The treasure unto him that bare the toil.
<pb n="259"/>
<lb/>The Iranians set in bonds on elephants
<lb/>All that were warriors among that folk.
<lb/>The Shah dispatched to Madain the captives,
<lb/>And all the wealth of Caesar, then went round
<lb/>The city and beheld a countryside
<lb/>More brilliant than the orbéd moon. The gardens,
<lb/>The parks, and streams, restored old age to freshness
<lb/>And youth. The king addressed his nobles thus:—
<lb/><q>Can this be Antakiya or young spring?
<lb/>Whoe’er hath seen not jocund Paradise
<lb/>Whereof the soil is musk, the bricks are gold,
<lb/>Whose waters are rose-water and trees jewels,
<lb/>Whose country is the sky, whose heaven the sun,
<lb/>Should look on this fresh land, and may it be—
<lb/>This land of Rome—in full prosperity.</q>
</p>


</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><head>How Nushirwan built the City of Zib-i-Khusrau in the Likeness
of Antakiya and settled the Roman Captives therein</head>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1644"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan gave orders to construct
<lb/>A city having palaces and streams,
<lb/>Like Antakiya, radiant as a lamp—
<lb/>All rosaries and mansions, parks and gardens.
<lb/>The great men, bright of heart and happy, called it
<lb/>Zib-i-Khusrau.<note>The Ornament of Khusrau.</note> "Twas like the jocund spring—
<lb/>A paradise all colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The captives taken in the towns of Rome,
<lb/>Whose hands and feet were galled with heavy bonds,
<lb/>Were set at large by Nushirwan’s command,
<lb/>And sent to dwell in joy in that new city.
<lb/>He said: <q>We have erected this new seat—
<lb/>All gardens, rosaries, and palaces—
<pb n="260"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1645"/>
<lb/>That each might have a dwelling to his mind
<lb/>And worthy of his name.</q>
</p>

<p>He gave to each
<lb/>Goods, and the earth was decked like Paradise.
<lb/>At sight of all the mansions, streets, and marts
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Each space is occupied.</q>
<lb/>A clamorous cordwainer came and said:—
<lb/><q>O unjust Shah! there was a mulberry
<lb/>Within my dwelling at Kaliniyus
<lb/>Before my courtyard; from Zib-i-Khusrau
<lb/>I have not any such advantages,
<lb/>For there is no such tree before my door.</q>
</p>

<p>So Nushirwan bade men to plant green trees
<lb/>Before the door of that misfortuned one.
<lb/>The Shah then chose a Christian unto whom
<lb/>He gave authority, wealth, troops, and said:—
<lb/><q>Zib-i-Khusrau is thine and thine the charge
<lb/>Of all the stranger-folk and their new home.
<lb/>Be like a tree that beareth fruit and be
<lb/>The city’s sire at whiles, at whiles its son.
<lb/>Be bountiful and beautify the place,
<lb/>Not covetous, and keep the mean in all.</q>
</p>

<p>The Shah marched forth from Antakiya, leaving
<lb/>A Christian and experienced man in charge.
<lb/>Farfuriyus thereafter brought to Caesar
<lb/>Intelligence about Kaliniyus,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>The experienced Nushirwan
<lb/>Came in his state with troops and elephants.
<lb/>So mighty is his host that seas and mountains
<lb/>Are all confounded by the horses’ dust.</q>
<lb/>Then Caesar writhed for that which he had spoken,
<lb/>And called to him his prudent chiefs. His heart
<lb/>Was full of fear because of Nushirwan;
<lb/>All day and through three watches of the night
<lb/>He canvassed what to do. Thus spake a priest:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1645"/>
<lb/><q>Thou’rt ill-advised because thou hast not power
<pb n="261"/>
<lb/>To fight with Nushirwan. The foe will raise
<lb/>The dust from this fair realm and bring to naught
<lb/>The achievements of the Caesars. In debate
<lb/>The feeble-tongued endangereth the state.</q>
</p>


</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><head>How Caesar wrote to Nushirwan and sent Tribute</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now Caesar heard this and his heart was troubled,
<lb/>His counsels were o’ercast by Nushirwan.
<lb/>He chose of the philosophers of Rome
<lb/>From regions scathless of the enemy,
<lb/>A man of eloquence and understanding,
<lb/>While of the priests three score unsmirched in soul
<lb/>And wisdom volunteered. He sent the Shah
<lb/>An embassage. Those magnates took their way.
<lb/>Their leader was that man of wits, Mihras—
<lb/>A warrior old in wisdom, young in years.
<lb/>There went before them treasures of all kinds
<lb/>Past reckoning, while Caesar, who repented
<lb/>His language in the past, dispatched no stint
<lb/>Of adulation, counsels, and fair words,
<lb/>With heavy tribute and with hostages
<lb/>Both of his own and of his nobles’ kin.
<lb/>Mihras, when he had come to Nushirwan,
<lb/>Pronounced his praises in the Roman tongue,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>So shrewd and just is he,
<lb/>He will produce stars from his sleeves!</q> Twas thus
<lb/>He spake to Nushirwan: <q>Set not, O king!
<lb/>Such value on the world. Thou art in Rome
<lb/>Now and Iran is void; it hath not worth
<lb/>Or glory. So, when Caesar is away
<lb/>From Rome, this country valueth not one gnat.
<lb/>The worth deriveth wholly from the man;
<lb/>When he is lost the value is lost too.
<pb n="262"/>
<lb/>If this commotion be but for wealth’s sake—
<lb/>That ruiner of wisdom and contentment—
<lb/>Lo! I have brought thee all the wealth of Rome,
<lb/>For more than land and treasure is a soul
<lb/>Serene.</q>
<lb/>The king’s heart, when he heard this, grew
<lb/>As jocund as a garden in the spring,
<lb/>And he accepted what the envoy brought—
<lb/>The purses of gold coin, and hostages—
<lb/>Gave commendations to the ambassadors,
<lb/>Enlarging on the value of the gifts,
<lb/>And said: <q>O clear in wisdom! any one
<lb/>Whom wisdom feedeth is a mighty man.
<lb/>If all the soil of Rome were turned to gold
<lb/>Thou wouldst outvalue still that noble land.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They set as tribute on those fields and fells
<lb/>A hundred ox-hides brimming with dinars
<milestone unit="calced" n="1646"/>
<lb/>To be dispatched by Caesar to the king
<lb/>Each year with other gifts and offerings.
<lb/>His troops were not to occupy Yemen,
<lb/>Or to require aught of the people there.
<lb/>Therewith was heard the blare of trump and clash
<lb/>Of brazen cymbals, and the prudent world-lord
<lb/>Led back his host. He went his way to Sham,
<lb/>And tarried there awhile. He brought with him
<lb/>So many implements of war and troops,
<lb/>So many captives, purses, crowns, and thrones,
<lb/>That earth’s back bent beneath the elephants,
<lb/>And purses full of drachms. When he resolved
<lb/>To quit that land he set in charge thereof
<lb/>Shirwi, son of Bahram, and said: <q>Demand
<lb/>The tribute due from Caesar and accord not
<lb/>Remission for a month or day.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Shirwi,
<lb/>Who kissed the ground, blessed and addressed the Shah:—
<lb/><q>Mayst thou be happy and victorious,
<lb/>And may the royal Tree ne’er pale its leaves.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When at the monarch’s portal had begun
<lb/>The drum-roll flag and troops fared toward Arman.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><head>The Birth of Nushzad, the Son of Nishirwan, by a
Woman who was a Christian</head>
<p>
<lb/>Like to the sun was Nishirwan, the king—
<lb/>The world’s hope and its fear. Just as above
<lb/>Sol speedeth on its pathway carrying
<lb/>A sword in this hand and in that hand love,
<lb/>Is all relentless in its hour of rage,
<lb/>But in its day of ruth all clemency,
<lb/>So was this Shah of royal lineage,
<lb/>Who had adorned the world with equity.
<lb/>Know this—in my regard the monarch’s state
<lb/>And subject’s, if they holy be and pure,
<lb/>Requireth of necessity a mate,
<lb/>Dress, provand, and a privacy secure;
<lb/>While if the wife be pious and discreet
<lb/>A heaped-up treasure will she prove, and all
<lb/>The more if locks musk-scented to her feet
<lb/>Descend, and she be more than common tall,
<lb/>Wise, learned, well counselled, chaste, and can express
<lb/>Herself in fair discourse with gentleness.
<lb/>The noble Shah possessed a wife like this,
<lb/>In height a cypress and in looks a moon,
<lb/>This Moon-face was a Christian, and her beauty
<lb/>Engrossed the tongues of all. She bare a babe
<lb/>Sun-faced, out-shining Venus in the sky.
<lb/>The noble mother called the child Nashzad,
<lb/>And no fierce blast assailed that lovely boy.
<pb n="264"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1647"/>
<lb/>He grew up as he were a straight-stemmed cypress—
<lb/>A youth of parts, the glory of the realm.
<lb/>He knew of Hell, the path to Paradise,
<lb/>Of Christ, of Esdras, and Zarduhsht, but he,
<lb/>Believing not the Zandavasta, bathed
<lb/>His visage in the fount of Christ, preferring
<lb/>His mother’s to his father’s Faith: the age
<lb/>Was lost in wonderment at him. The king
<lb/>Was grievously concerned about his son,
<lb/>Because that Rose bare only fruit of thorns.
<lb/>They shut the portal of Nashzad’s fair palace,
<lb/>And there imprisoned him. His prison-house
<lb/>Was at Gund-i-Shapir<note>Kand-i-Shapir in the text. For this city see p. 219.</note> far from his home
<lb/>And father. Many criminals and captives
<lb/>Were with him in that city and in ward.
<lb/>Now when the Shah was on his way from Rome
<lb/>The turmoil and the journey tried him sorely;
<lb/>So weak was he that he could hold no court.
<lb/>One bare the tidings to Nushzad and told him:—
<lb/><q>The Glory of the empire is bedimmed;
<lb/>The watchful world-lord Nishirwan is dead,
<lb/>Bequeathing to another earth and time.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His father’s death rejoiced Nushzad. Oh! may
<lb/>No pleasure and enjoyment e’er be his!
<lb/>He that doth joy when just kings pass away
<lb/>Must have a gloomy temper. As to this
<lb/>A famous ancient said: <q>If thou art glad
<lb/>At my decease see that thou never die.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>From death thou know’st no succour can be had,
<lb/>The past is one here with futurity;
<lb/>But never death will wreck the soul of one
<lb/>Whose toil hath favour in the sight of God.
<lb/>Call we a reprobate and fool that son
<lb/>Who in his father’s footsteps hath not trod.
<lb/>Wet be the seed of colocynth or dry
<pb n="265"/>
<lb/>It will not savour musk, then where the need
<lb/>That it should change from what should spring thereby
<lb/>By nature if the gardener sow its seed?
<lb/>When any plant is predisposed to earth,
<lb/>It parteth with the sunshine and pure air,
<lb/>Therefrom no foliage or fruit hath birth,
<lb/>It liveth for the earth and dieth there.
</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><head>The Sickness of Nushirwan and the Sedition of Nushzad</head>
<p>
<lb/>I have made mention of Nushzad. Take heed
<lb/>That thou quit not the path of equity.
<lb/>If heaven possessed a father then indeed
<lb/>He would resemble Nushirwan, so why
<lb/>Should his own son quit the paternal way,
<lb/>And seek the royal dignity and throne?
<milestone unit="calced" n="1648"/>
<lb/>Accord thine ear to all that I shall say,
<lb/>And I will keep back nothing, O my son!
<lb/>I have well ordered that I did receive
<lb/>From rustic bard, and by that token too
<lb/>Am fain some memory of myself to leave,
<lb/>So be the honour unto whom 'tis due.
<lb/>This is my wish that after I am dead
<lb/>My fame as poet evermore shall last.
<lb/>On this wise spake a Persian bard whose head
<lb/>A hundred years and twenty had o'erpast:—
<lb/><q>He that is hostile to the world's great king
<lb/>Not of man's stock but Ahriman's must be.</q>
</p>

<p>Now of Nushzad they tell that very thing
<lb/>As handed down by ancient legendry.
<lb/>Whenas the son of Nishirwan had heard:—
<lb/><q>The throne of that right royal Tree is void,</q>
<pb n="266"/>
<lb/>He oped his palace-door, and from all quarters
<lb/>Troops gathered unto him—all that had 'scaped
<lb/>From wisdom's bonds and had been put in ward
<lb/>By Nushirwan. Nushzad unchained the mad,
<lb/>And all the city was in consternation;
<lb/>But he assembled of the citizens
<lb/>All that were Christians, whether priests or prelates,
<lb/>Assembled many haughty cavaliers
<lb/>And swordsmen, while his mother gave him wealth—
<lb/>The treasures lavished on her by the Shah.
<lb/>There gathered to him thirty thousand men,
<lb/>All famous and prepared to fight. He took
<lb/>The cities round; his fame was noised abroad.
<lb/>He wrote a letter to his kinsman<note>In the Faith. Cf. p. 269.</note> Caesar,
<lb/>Made known his dark designs, and said: <q>Arise
<lb/>O king! for thou art lord, friend, of one Faith
<lb/>With me, and Caesar. As it were Rome, Iran,
<lb/>Its worship and its settlements, are thine,
<lb/>My father hath been sick and now is dead,
<lb/>His wakeful fortune hath been overthrown.</q>
</p>

<p>The tidings reached the towns of Madain
<lb/>Of what the son of Nushirwan had done,
<lb/>Whereat the warden of that march dispatched
<lb/>To Nushirwan a cavalier to whom
<lb/>He told what he had heard and what was secret.
<lb/>The messenger went like a rapid stream,
<lb/>And came to Nushirwan to whom he gave
<lb/>The letter, telling all that he had heard,
<lb/>And of the overt actions of Nushzad.
<lb/>The Shah, when he had listened and had read
<lb/>The letter, grieved thereat and was confounded,
<lb/>Held session with the noble archimages,
<lb/>Debating much with them in privacy,
<lb/>And, when the consultation reached its end
<lb/>In resolution, bade a scribe attend.
</p>


</div>


<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><head>The Letter of Nushirwan to Ram Barzin, the Warden of the
March of Madain, respecting the Taking of Nushzad</head>
<pb n="267"/>

<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1649"/>
<lb/>The Shah, both seared and sore, with frowning face 
<lb/>And sighing lips, then had this letter written
<lb/>Wherein he first of all gave praise to Him,
<lb/>Who fashioned the heavens, time, and earth,
<lb/>The Artificer of Sun and Moon and Saturn,
<lb/>The Illuminer of Grace, of crown, and throne:—
<lb/><q>From worthless stubble up to elephant
<lb/>And lion, from the dust on emmet’s foot
<lb/>Up to the Nile, though men shall roam from earth
<lb/>To turning heaven they roam beneath God’s sway.
<lb/>No limit can be seen to His behest,
<lb/>And none will rob Him of the sovereignty.
<lb/>Of that unpleasing letter have I heard,
<lb/>Sent by that most injurious son of mine,
<lb/>And of the criminals who broke from ward,
<lb/>And are assembled now about Nushzad.
<lb/>'Twere better one should quit the world than see
<lb/>A day like this, for all are born to die;
<lb/>First Nishirwan and then Nushzad must go.
<lb/>From gnat and ant e’en to rhinoceros
<lb/>And elephant, none can escape the claws
<lb/>And beak of death. If earth revealed its secrets,
<lb/>Displaying everything from first to last,
<lb/>Its bosom would be found fulfilled with kings,
<lb/>Its breast with blood of cavaliers, its skirts
<lb/>With men of lore, the creases of its robe
<lb/>With fair-cheeked dames. Then wherefore set a crown
<lb/>Or helmet on thy head when death’s plumed shaft
<lb/>Will pierce them both? No one rejoiceth much
<lb/>At death of son, albeit all must die;
<lb/>But as for those consorting with Nushzad,
<pb n="268"/>
<lb/>Who reckon on the death of Nishirwan,
<lb/>The death of them would be a cause for joy
<lb/>If but Nushzad should 'scape the evil day.
<lb/>Moreover none but misbegotten knaves
<lb/>Would count upon the death of righteous Shahs.
<lb/>Now though Nushzad hath turned his head from us,
<lb/>In that the Div thus hath conspired with him,
<lb/>His purpose is not firm in this regard;
<lb/>He was inflamed when he obtained his wish.
<lb/>He could not have the post as well as we,
<lb/>And thus was ruined by a false report,
<lb/>For had the crown been void of Nishirwan
<lb/>Nushzad had been the glory of the realm.
<lb/>Still such an act is worthy of his Faith,
<lb/>And suited to an evil soul like his.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1650"/>
<lb/>I am not moved or fearful in this matter,
<lb/>In that our son’s religion is impure;
<lb/>Moreover, for the wealth that he hath wrecked,
<lb/>That matter weigheth nothing on my heart;
<lb/>While as for all that have combined with him,
<lb/>And banished from their hearts their awe of us—
<lb/>The ill-doers, the malignant, and base-born,
<lb/>Unworthy to be subjects to myself—
<lb/>We look upon them also with contempt:
<lb/>Let not their doings make thy heart afraid.
<lb/>My fear is of the Master of the world,
<lb/>Who is in wisdom wiser than the wise.
<lb/>We must not grow unthankful in our souls
<lb/>To God who is omniscient in good.
<lb/>Me hath He given triumph and success,
<lb/>Grace and the diadem of king of kings,
<lb/>And had my praise been worthy of His gifts
<lb/>It would have bettered my prosperity.
<lb/>My son hath found a home and rest elsewhere;
<lb/>No single drop of him came from my loins.
<lb/>With his awakening my foe arrived,
<pb n="269"/>
<lb/>And, I do fear me, toil. Still if the World-lord
<lb/>Hath no occasion to be wroth with me
<lb/>I reck not of such things. In my regard
<lb/>All they that are confederate with my son
<lb/>Are vile and despicable. Tis his letter
<lb/>That, if it bringeth Caesar, will befoul
<lb/>My stream. The twain must be akin, methinketh,
<lb/>Since they are one in Faith and policy.
<lb/>The man that quitteth his forefathers’ Faith
<lb/>Is one whose wits are much to seek. That son
<lb/>Is best who is of one Faith, not at war,
<lb/>With his own sire. Albeit though that insensate
<lb/>Turn from the right no lip must ope to curse him.
<lb/>To curse him is in essence to curse us,
<lb/>Because he is of our own flesh and blood.
<lb/>Array the host, take order for the war,
<lb/>But act with moderation and hold back,
<lb/>While if the matter cometh to a pass,
<lb/>And if he offer battle, be not fierce.
<lb/>To capture him is better than to slay:
<lb/>Perchance he will turn back from evil doing,
<lb/>And then the stream that reared that noble Cypress
<lb/>Must come not on it in a bath of dust;
<lb/>But if he hold his honoured person cheaply,
<lb/>If that tall Cypress shall demean itself,
<lb/>And if he spurn the pillow of delight,
<lb/>Withhold not thou the mace and scimitar.
<lb/>A man of rank indulging base desires
<lb/>Cannot be freed from that propensity,
<lb/>And such a high-born man is base indeed
<lb/>When he doth fight the monarch of the world.
<lb/>Fear not to slay him if he would pour out
<lb/>His own head’s blood upon the dust. He hasteth
<milestone unit="calced" n="1651"/>
<lb/>To give his faith to Caesar and put off
<lb/>Allegiance to our crown, whereby his greatness
<lb/>Hath grown vile, wretched, and calamitous,
<pb n="270"/>
<lb/>And he hath chosen ruin from high heaven.
<lb/>In this regard said Mihr-i-Nush—a sage
<lb/>Who worshipped God and wore the woollen vest:—
<lb/><q>The man that joyeth in a father’s death,
<lb/>May his be neither happiness nor breath.</q>
<lb/>Seek not for light from darkness, else wilt thou
<lb/>But mingle fire and water in the stream.
<lb/>Man’s only rest is when his toil is done:
<lb/>It is fate’s law and we must acquiesce.
<lb/>Be not in friendship with the turning sky,
<lb/>For whiles thou art the kernel, whiles the shell.
<lb/>Why seek from its pomegranate hue and scent,
<lb/>For it will rob thee of them both at sight?
<lb/>Whene’er the turning sky exalteth thee,
<lb/>Then is thy time for travail, fear, and loss.
<lb/>As for the soldiers that are with Nushzad,
<lb/>And err so greatly from the path of duty,
<lb/>Know that they are but wind and sport to us,
<lb/>The mockery of the wise, no mystery.
<lb/>As for the Christians that are in his host,
<lb/>And have revolted for religion’s sake,
<lb/>The regimen of Christ is such that they
<lb/>Are frighted if one lifteth up one’s voice,
<lb/>Desert his precepts and his path, and end
<lb/>By turning into foemen of the Cross.
<lb/>As for the other folk—the common herd,
<lb/>Ill-taught, ill-minded, and adventurous—
<lb/>They will not fright the heart of any man:
<lb/>Their counsel and a breath of air are one.
<lb/>Now if Nushzad be taken in the fight,
<lb/>Discourse not with him touching these affairs;
<lb/>His person must not suffer injury,
<lb/>His raiment must not show the rents of blows,
<lb/>Because his women-folk will slay themselves.
<lb/>His palace will afford the best of prisons
<pb n="271"/>
<lb/>Both for himself and those that follow him.
<lb/>Bar not to him the portal of my treasures,
<lb/>Albeit one so dear hath grown so vile,
<lb/>And as for raiment, victuals, tapestries,
<lb/>And carpets there must be no stint at all,
<lb/>For he is fitted but for things like these.
<lb/>As for those matchlords of the Iranians—
<lb/>Those that have girded up their loins with him—
<lb/>When thou hast conquered do not hesitate,
<lb/>But cleave them through the middle with the sword,
<lb/>For all that are the great king’s enemies
<lb/>Thou rightly flingest to the crocodiles.
<lb/>Besides these, all that are opposed to me
<lb/>At heart—the seed of wicked Ahriman—
<lb/>Who have forgotten all our benefits,
<lb/>Thou now wilt test in dealing with Nushzad.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1652"/>
<lb/>All acted as our watchmen heretofore,
<lb/>And were in terror of our punishments.
<lb/>For those on-lookers who have vilified,
<lb/>And wagged their tongues against, Nushzad, know thou
<lb/>That they have in especial cursed ourselves,
<lb/>Preparing trouble in mine evil day.
<lb/>Do not thou too as they; thus foemen speak.
<lb/>Unworthy as he is he is mine own,
<lb/>Such is the truthful witness of my heart.
<lb/>The tongue of each man that hath spoken ill,
<lb/>Or acted with injustice toward him, brand
<lb/>In presence of the folk. May such an one
<lb/>Have neither tongue nor mouth. As for the man
<lb/>That warreth to overthrow the Shah, employing
<lb/>Guile, enmity, hostility, and faith
<lb/>In Ahriman, such, as the famed Shah’s foe,
<lb/>Must not be suffered in the realm.</q>
</p>

<p>They set
<lb/>The Shah’s own seal upon the letter. Then
<lb/>The messenger departed with all speed,
<pb n="272"/>
<lb/>And, when to Ram Barzin he made his way,
<lb/>Told all that he had heard the great king say.

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><head>How Ram Barzin fought with Nushzad, and how Nushzad
was slain</head>
<p>
<lb/>That done, he gave to Ram Barzin the letter
<lb/>With its behests for dealing with Nushzad,
<lb/>To levy troops, make war, and banish ruth.
<lb/>When the old man had read it, and had heard
<lb/>The messenger at large, the din of tymbals
<lb/>Arose at cock-crow at the palace-portal,
<lb/>A mighty host marched forth from Madain,
<lb/>And Ram Barzin went swiftly to the war.
<lb/>News reached Nushzad who called and paid his host,
<lb/>While all the Christians and grandees of Rum
<lb/>That dwelt along the march of that fair land
<lb/>Assembled with Shammas as general:
<lb/>Those warriors' hands all had been bathed in blood.
<lb/>A shout rose from the portal of Nushzad,
<lb/>And then the army, like a wind-tossed sea,
<lb/>Moved from the city out upon the plain,
<lb/>Their heads all war, their hearts revenge and venom.
<lb/>When Ram Barzin beheld that army's dust
<lb/>He blew the trumpets and arrayed the host.
<lb/>The dust of cavaliers, the charge of chieftains,
<lb/>The brandishing of mighty maces, rent
<lb/>The hearts of flints; none saw the bright sun's face.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1653"/>
<lb/>Then in the centre of the host Nushzad
<lb/>Set on his head a Rum helm. His host
<lb/>Was full of Christian clericals from Rum;
<lb/>The soil was hidden by their horses' hoofs.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Earth seetheth, and the air
<lb/>Is shrieking over it.</q>
<lb/>A warrior,
<pb n="273"/>
<lb/>Beclad in mail and hight Piruz the old,
<lb/>Came boldly forth and cried: <q>O famed Nushzad!
<lb/>Who wantonly hath turned thy head from right?
<lb/>Contend not with the army of the king
<lb/>Because thou wilt repent thee of this strife.
<lb/>Thou hast abjured the Faith of Gayomart,
<lb/>The pathway of Hushang and Tahmuras.
<lb/>The arch-deceiver Christ was put to death
<lb/>Because he had renounced the Faith of God;
<lb/>So choose not him, of all that founded Faiths,
<lb/>Who so mistook the aspect of his work,
<lb/>For if the Grace of God had shone in him
<lb/>How could the Jews have gained the upper hand?
<lb/>Heard hast thou what thy sire, that noble man,
<lb/>The world-lord, did to Caesar and to Rum,
<lb/>Yet now thou wouldst contend with him and raise
<lb/>Thy head to heaven! For all thy moon-like mien,
<lb/>Thy Grace and stature, neck, limbs, hands, and mace,
<lb/>I see no wisdom with thee anywhere,
<lb/>Such recklessness possesseth thy dark soul!
<lb/>Woe for this head of thine, crown, name, and birth,
<lb/>Which now thou wouldst abandon to the blast!
<lb/>For son to seek his living father's throne,
<lb/>How should this be? Tis neither use nor right.
<lb/>To seek the crown, if he be dead, is well;
<lb/>To seek to fight him now is criminal.
<lb/>Save thou be snorting elephant or lion
<lb/>Thou canst not match Shah Nishirwan, and though
<lb/>I have not seen, O prince! a bridle-hand
<lb/>Like thine limned in the palace of the Shahs,
<lb/>Such foot and stirrups, such a breast and neck,
<lb/>Such ardour in the fight and such a mace,
<lb/>Though painter never looked on such a picture,
<lb/>Or any age on such a prince, yet burn not
<lb/>The soul of Nishirwan by childishness,
<pb n="274"/>
<lb/>Or stultify the world-illuming crown,
<lb/>For hostile howsoever a son may be
<lb/>His father will lament when he is slain.
<lb/>Dismount, ask quarter of the Shah, and fling
<lb/>This mace and Rum helmet to the ground;
<lb/>Then if far hence some chilling blast should make
<lb/>The dark dust settle on thy countenance,
<lb/>The Shah's heart would consume for thee, the sun
<lb/>Weep o'er thy face. Sow not throughout the world
<lb/>The seed of enmity, for hastiness
<lb/>Becometh not a prince. If thou dost swerve
<lb/>From mine advice and trust to violence,
<lb/>And to thy might, the counsel of Piruz
<milestone unit="calced" n="1654"/>
<lb/>Oft will recur to thee, and then the words
<lb/>Of thine ill counsellors will seem but wind.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Nushzad made answer: <q>O wind-pated dotard!
<lb/>Ask not my troops—exalted warriors—
<lb/>Or me—the Shah's son—to cry out for quarter.
<lb/>The Faith of Nushirwan is naught to me;
<lb/>My heart inclineth to my mother—her
<lb/>Whose constant practice is the Faith of Christ.
<lb/>I will not quit her Grace and Faith. Although
<lb/>Its Founder—Christ—was slain, the World-lord's Grace
<lb/>Hath not forsaken Him. That Holy One
<lb/>Hath passed from this earth back to holy God,
<lb/>Such was His aspiration when on earth.
<lb/>I may be slain but shall not fear to die,
<lb/>For to that bane there is no antidote.</q>
</p>





<p>
<lb/>He answered thus the old Piruz and veiled
<lb/>Air's face with shafts. The warriors of the host
<lb/>Advanced, the battle-cry and clarion's blare
<lb/>Went up, Nushzad, the chief, spurred on like fire,
<lb/>Came as it were Azargashasp, and broke
<lb/>The left wing of the army of the Shah,
<lb/>Where none remained to fight with him. He slew
<pb n="275"/>
<lb/>Full many a Lion of the host, whereat,
<lb/>Grown wrathful, Ram Barzin bade shower arrows,
<lb/>And fill the air as 'twere with hail in spring.
<lb/>The din of battle went up on both sides
<lb/>From all the valiant soldiers there engaged.
<lb/>Nushzad was wounded in the melee. Oft
<lb/>He called to mind the counsel of Piruz,
<lb/>And reached in pain the centre of the host,
<lb/>Pierced by a shaft and pale with agony.
<lb/>Thus said he to the warriors of Rum:—
<lb/><q>To fight one's sire is wretched, vile, accursed!</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bewailing and lamenting thus he summoned
<lb/>A bishop and confessed his heart's desires.
<lb/>He said: <q>The evil fortune caused by me
<lb/>Has fallen rigorously upon myself.
<lb/>Now, since my head will pass beneath the dust,
<lb/>Dispatch a horseman to my mother. Say
<lb/>To her: <q>Nushzad hath left this world. For him
<lb/>The days of right and wrong are at an end.
<lb/>I prithee be not grieved at heart for me;
<lb/>Such is the fashion of this Wayside Inn!
<lb/>Since I have been allotted this dark day
<lb/>How could my heart be glad and brighten earth!
<lb/>All living creatures are but born to die;
<lb/>Grieve not for me, for thou art mortal too.
<lb/>Tis not my slaying that confoundeth me,
<lb/>But worse—my sire's displeasure. Let me have
<lb/>No mausoleum, throne, or stately rites,
<lb/>But bury me with Christian burial.
<lb/>I need no camphor, musk, or spicery,
<lb/>For arrow-stricken I depart the world.</q></q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1655"/>
<lb/>He spake and shut his lips. Thus passed Nushzad,
<lb/>That noble Lion-heart. Now when his troops
<lb/>Heard of his death they fled the battlefield.
<lb/>The Iranian leader, hearing that the prince
<lb/>Was slain, went weeping to his couch in haste.
<pb n="276"/>
<lb/>The troops ceased slaying on the field of fight,
<lb/>And neither joyed nor spoiled. They saw the prince
<lb/>Slain and o'erthrown with ignominy, his head
<lb/>Upon a Rum bishop’s breast: the field
<lb/>Was filled with wailing for him. Ram Barzin
<lb/>Was troubled to the heart and asked the prelate:—
<lb/><q>What know'st thou of the prince's dying wishes?</q>
<lb/><q>Except his mother,</q> thus the bishop answered,
<lb/><q>None must behold his head exposed. He, seeing
<lb/>That he was wounded by a shaft, forbade
<lb/>All obsequies and musk and spicery,
<lb/>Or coronet, brocade of Rum, and throne,
<lb/>Perceiving his to be the slave's dark lot.
<lb/>His mother now will shroud him and provide
<lb/>A tomb and winding-sheet with Christian rites,
<lb/>While his condition now is that of Christ's,
<lb/>Although he did not die upon the Cross.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Of all the Christians that were in the land
<lb/>There was not one but had his visage torn.
<lb/>A cry rose from the country. Men and women

<div><head>PART II: THE STORY OF BUZURJMIHR AND OF THE SEVEN BANQUETS OF NUSHIRWAN</head>
<pb n="278"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="argument"><head>Argument</head>
<p> The Shah, being disquieted by a dream, sends emissaries through the empire to find an interpreter. One is discovered at Marv in the person of Buzurjmihr, then a youth, who having been brought before the Shah interprets the dream and is advanced to great honour. The Shah subsequently gives a series of entertainments at which discussions on wisdom and morals are substituted for the usual diversions of Oriental banquets, and Buzurjmihr again greatly distinguishes himself.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="intro"><head>NOTE</head>
<p>Persia, like other nations, has its Wisdom-literature. This comprises apologues, apothegms, proverbs, parables, the interpretation of dreams and dark sentences, astrological forecasts, the solution of problems, the supplying the correct answer to questions relating to religion, morals, conduct, and expediency, and longer discourses thereon, reflections on fate and fortune, on the uncertainty of all terrestrial affairs, on the vanity of striving after wealth and fame, and the importance of leaving behind one a good name after death. All these forms of wisdom find expression in the Shahnameh, and the poet himself has been not backward in contributing his quota. At the first available opportunity in his work he utters his <quote>Praise of Wisdom</quote>—the first created of God and His best gift to man.<note n="1">Vol. i. p. 101. Cf. too p. 103, supra.</note></p>

<p> A collection of all the passages dealing with such themes and subjects as are mentioned above, and including Firdausi’s own reflections on such matters, as have occurred in the poem up to this point, would amount to something considerable, but scattered through a mass of narrative they are apt to be overlooked. In this reign, however, we are confronted by formal collections of primitive Persian Wisdom associated for the most part with the name of Buzurjmihr but to some extent with other great officials and with <pb n="279"/> Nushirwan himself. Firdausi availed himself of the opportunity of the conjunction of the just Shah with the wise counsellor to bring together all that he could find in his authorities and elsewhere on some of the subjects mentioned at the beginning of this note. That a large Pahlavi literature once existed on such matters, and arranged sometimes in the form of question and answer, we know from what is extant. Thus the sage in the <title>Din-i Mainog-i Khrad</title> (<title>Opinions of the Spirit of Wisdom</title>) consults the Spirit of Wisdom on sixty-two points and receives answers, e.g. <quote>The sage asked the spirit of wisdom thus: <q>Which man is the mightier?</q>... The spirit of wisdom answered thus: <q>That man is the mightier who is able to struggle with his own fiends; and, in particular, he who keeps these five fiends far from his person, which are such as greediness, wrath, lust, disgrace, and discontent.</q></quote><note n="1">WPT, iii. 81.</note> The concluding question is: <q>Which is that good work which is greater and better than all good works, and no trouble whatever is necessary for its performance?</q> The answer is: <q>To be grateful in the world, and to wish happiness for everyone. This is greater and better than every good work, and no commotion whatever is necessary for its performance.</q><note n="2">Id. 113.</note> These questions and answers are quite of a piece with the sages’ gnomes in the poem. There are also extant in Pahlavi the <q>Pandnamak-i Vazurg-Mihr-i Bakhtagan</q> or <q>Bakhtagan,</q> i.e. the <q>Book of Counsels of Buzurjmihr the son of Bakhtagan,</q> the <q>Characteristics of a Happy Man,</q> and other texts dealing with similar subjects.<note n="3">GIP, ii. 113 seq.</note> There can be no doubt but that Firdausi derived the sententious, gnomic, parenetic, or whatever one chooses to call them, portions of the Shahnama, like the narrative, indirectly from the Pahlavi. Four series of such passages occur in the present reign, The first and longest is in the present Part. The second is Buzurjmihr’s Discourse on good deeds and works in Part III. The third is Nushirwan’s answers to the questions addressed to him by the archmages. The fourth is the word-for-word examination that Hurmuzd, Nushirwan’s son, has to pass at the hands of Buzurjmihr, by order of the Shah, before being nominated as his father’s successor. One cannot help feeling a sneaking sympathy, reprehensible though it be, with him when we find him signalising his advent to the throne by making a clean sweep of his father’s ministers from whose <quote>wise saws and modern instances</quote> doubtlessly he had suffered much in the days of his youth. Nero acted similarly in the case of Burrus and the younger Seneca. Of these four series the third is concerned only partly with Wisdom-literature, some <pb n="280"/> of the questions dealing with Nushirwan’s own conduct on specified occasions. This and the fourth series will appear in Volume VIII, Buzurjmihr, the son of Bakhtagan, of Marv, the man chiefly associated with the Wisdom-literature of the Shahnama, is but a semi-historical figure hardly mentioned by any historian before Firdausi's time with the exception of Mas'udi who died when the poet was a youth. Mas'udi gives twelve maxims of Buzurjmihr’s and little else,<note n="4">MM, ii. 206 seg., vii. 164.</note> so that practically we are dependent on what Firdausi tells us, and this, with regard to the incidents recorded, generally has something of the preternatural about it. Buzurjmihr’s career begins with a dream, and while sleeping on his journey to the court a snake, which seems an Arab rather than a Persian touch, comes and breathes over him. Moreover, his fall from power is preceded by an omen and his restoration to favour accomplished by another. We never hear of him as being associated with any of Nushirwan’s great achievements in administration or in war. He is employed, it is true, upon two missions, once to expound a game—chess—and to propound another of his own invention—nard—and once to negotiate in time of war a loan for his master, which falls through owing to the fact that Nushirwan has a higher conception of the dignity of the office of the scribe than Buzurjmihr himself. His repute seems largely due to Firdausi, who used him as a peg whereon to hang all the old clothes of the Wisdom-literature that the poet was too conscientious to discard but could not dispose of elsewhere. There is, however, a thanksgiving couplet to testify that he was not sorry when the worst of his task was over.<note n="5">See p. 379.</note> If the number seven were not such a favourite in Persian story one might suggest that the Seven Banquets of Nushirwan originated in a perverted reminiscence of the seven Greek philosophers who were entertained for a while at his court when Justinian closed the schools of Athens,<note n="6">GDF, v. 93.</note> and that Buzurjmihr himself is not much more than a native composite reproduction of those hapless and disillusioned sages.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><head>How Nushirwan had a Dream and how Buzurjmihr interpreted it</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now in the tale of Buzurjmihr will we
<lb/>Reveal a cheerier visage. Do not deem
<lb/>That there is naught but folly in a dream;
<lb/>Know that a dream may smack of prophecy,
<lb/>And in especial when such visitings

<pb n="282"/>

<lb/>Impress the clear mind of a king of kings.
<lb/>The stars with sky and moon hold conference,
<lb/>Their words are whispered and dispersed through space,
<lb/>And clear souls dreaming see the future thence
<lb/>As fire is mirrored in the water’s face.
<lb/>One night Shah Nushirwan, the wise and shrewd,
<lb/>That lucid spirit, lay asleep and dreamed:
<lb/>A royal tree grew up before the throne,
<lb/>And joyed his heart. He called for harp and wine
<lb/>And minstrelsy, but on his throne of peace
<lb/>And joy there sat with him a sharp-toothed boar,
<lb/>Sat ready-dight for revelry and claimed
<lb/>To quaff the wine from Nushirwan’s own cup.
<lb/>Sol rose in Taurus and the skylark’s note
<lb/>Was heard on all sides yet the monarch sat
<lb/>Upon his throne in dudgeon at that dream.
<lb/>They called the interpreter of dreams and held
<lb/>A session of the magnates at the court.
<lb/>The Shah narrated to those archimages,
<lb/>The counsellors, his dream. The interpreter
<milestone unit="calced" n="1657"/>
<lb/>Made no reply, he knew of no such case,
<lb/>And one that pleadeth ignorance is excused.
<lb/>The Shah, thus left unanswered by the sages,
<lb/>Was instant what to do in his concern,
<lb/>And sent to every side an archimage,
<lb/>One enterprising, shrewd of heart, and wise.
<lb/>He made each take a purse and entertained
<lb/>High hopes from their return. In every purse
<lb/>There were ten thousand drachms that every envoy
<lb/>Might seek out some interpreter of dreams,
<lb/>Some man of understanding, some adept,
<lb/>To solve the world-king’s dream and to reveal
<lb/>The mystery, and then bestow on such
<lb/>A full purse and the royal compliments.
<note>Reading with P.</note>
</p>
<pb n="283"/>
<p>
<lb/>So to all parts a veteran archmage went—
<lb/>A prudent cavalier and man of lore.
<lb/>One of these chiefs—Azad Sarv—came to Marv,
<lb/>Went through the town and saw an archimage,
<lb/>Who taught the Zandavasta to some youths
<lb/>With harshness, anger, and raised voice. The tallest,
<lb/>An earnest student of the Zandavasta,
<lb/>One whom they used to title Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Was poring lovingly upon the roll.
<lb/>Azad Sarv turned his rein, drew near, and sought
<lb/>An explanation of the great king’s dream.
<lb/>The scribe replied: <q>’Tis not my business;
<lb/>The Zandavasta is my help to knowledge.
<lb/>I teach these children but I do not dare
<lb/>To breathe of aught beyond,</q> but Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Said blushing to his master, having heard
<lb/>The envoy’s words: <q>This quarry is for me;
<lb/>It is my business to interpret dreams.</q>
<lb/>His teacher bawled: <q>Hast thou thy roll by heart
<lb/>That thou shouldst thus exalt thy neck in pride,
<lb/>And set up as a dream-interpreter?</q>
<lb/>The envoy said to him: <q>O learned man!
<lb/>He may possess this skill; abash him not.
<lb/>This youth’s lot may be high through fortune’s teaching,
<lb/>Not thine.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The master wroth with Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Cried: <q>Tell then what thou knowest,</q> but he
<lb/>answered:
<lb/><q>I will speak not till set before the Shah.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy gave him money and a steed
<lb/>With all things needful. They set off from Marv,
<lb/>As pheasants pace 'neath roses, and discoursed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1658"/>
<lb/>About the Shah, his power, Grace, crown, and state
<lb/>Till at the hour for provand and repose
<lb/>They reached a spot with water, lighted down
<note>Cf. Vol. v. p. 260.</note>
</p>
<pb n="284"/>
<p>
<lb/>Beneath a tree and, having eaten, rested.
<lb/>While Buzurjmihr slept in the shade, his mantle
<lb/>Drawn o’er his face, his noble way-mate saw,
<lb/>Being still awake, a snake which drew away
<lb/>The mantle from the sleeper, vehemently
<lb/>Breathed over him from head to foot, then clomb
<lb/>The tree. When that black snake had scaled the stem
<lb/>The youth awoke, and when the serpent saw
<lb/>The youth’s discomfiture it disappeared
<lb/>Amid the dusky boughs. The envoy stood
<lb/>Astound, invoking oft the name of God,
<lb/>And thought: <q>This wise youth will attain to greatness!</q>
<lb/>They left that wood, pushed on, and reached the Shah.
<lb/>The envoy hurried first before the throne
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, and said: <q>Oh! may thy fortune
<lb/>Be ever young, O Shah! From court I went
<lb/>To Marv and roamed about as pheasant doth
<lb/>Within a rosary. Amid the sages
<lb/>I found a wise youth and have brought him hither
<lb/>In haste.</q>
<lb/>He told withal what Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Had said and of the portent of the snake.
<lb/>The world-lord called and told the dream to him.
<lb/>He heard, grew full of matter, and replied:
<lb/><q>There is a youth disguised in women’s garb
<lb/>Within thy bower. Now put all strangers forth,
<lb/>That none may know our purpose, and command
<lb/>Thy ladies all to pass before thy presence
<lb/>With measured tread, and then I will demand
<lb/>Of that bold reprobate how came he thus
<lb/>Within the Lion’s lair, for God will show
<lb/>The secret fact to be as thou hast dreamed.</q>
<lb/>The Shah put forth all strangers, closed the palace
<lb/>Of king of kings, and bade the eunuchs bring,

<pb n="285"/>

<lb/>As swift as smoke, the Idols dwelling there.
<lb/>They came, those Idols of his bower, in all
<milestone unit="calced" n="1659"/>
<lb/>Their perfumes, tints, and beauty. All these fair ones,
<lb/>Exhaling jasmine, dainty, modest, passed
<lb/>With leisured tread before him, but no man
<lb/>Appeared among them, and like an angry lion
<lb/>Raged Nushirwan. Then said the interpreter:
<lb/><q>This should not be; there is a youth among them.
<lb/>Bid them to pass a second time all bare,
<lb/>And probe their practice to the uttermost.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah spake thus: <q>Cause them to pass again,
<lb/>And put away the veil of modesty.</q>
<lb/>They passed the second time and, when all thought
<lb/>The dream an empty one, a youth appeared
<lb/>Of cypress-stature and of kingly looks,
<lb/>But quaking like a willow and despairing
<lb/>Of his dear life. Now in the great king’s bower
<lb/>Were seventy girls, all noble Cypresses,
<lb/>And one of them, with cheeks of ivory,
<lb/>Was daughter to the governor of Chach.
<lb/>The youth with jasmine-face and musk-perfumed
<lb/>Had been her love at home. He followed her
<lb/>Where’er she went and served her like a slave.
<lb/>The Shah inquired of her: <q>Who is this man
<lb/>So cherished by my slave, so favored, young,
<lb/>And daring, in the bower of Nushirwan?</q>
<lb/><q>He is not,</q> said the girl, <q>as old as I.
<lb/>He is but young. One mother bore us both.
<lb/>Our sire was different, our mother one.
<lb/>There is naught wrong between us. He assumed
<lb/>This kind of habit, for through modesty
<lb/>He did not dare to look upon the Shah.
<lb/>Oh! make it not a pretext that my brother
<lb/>From shamefastness before thee veiled his face.</q>
<lb/>The Shah said to the youth: <q>Thou worthless dog!
<lb/>Both race and family are smirched by thee.</q>
</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>
<lb/>He frowned. He was amazed at that young pair,
<lb/>Then bade in wrath the executioner:
<lb/><q>Let the dust hide them.</q>
<lb/>So he haled them back
<lb/>Behind the curtains of Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And hung them there—a warning to the rest.
<lb/>The Shah gave that interpreter of dreams
<lb/>Purse, steeds, and robes, and, wondering at his knowledge,
<lb/>Observed his sayings. They inscribed his name
<lb/>Among the counsellors, the archimages.
<lb/>Thus prospered Buzurjmihr, and circling heaven
<lb/>Showed him its face, while ever day by day
<lb/>His fortune greatened, and the Shah’s heart joyed
<lb/>In him exceedingly.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1660"/>
<lb/>That heart was full
<lb/>Of right; the Shah was cultured, heart and brain.
<lb/>He had residing at his court archmages,
<lb/>And sages understanding in all knowledge.
<lb/>Three score and ten—all men of eloquence—
<lb/>Were lodged and entertained continually.
<lb/>He used, when not engaged with justice, largess,
<lb/>Festivity or war, to question them,
<lb/>And deck his heart with knowledge. Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Though still a youth, was eloquent and shrewd
<lb/>And fair to look upon, surpassing all
<lb/>The famed archmages, readers of the stars,
<lb/>And sages, in his knowledge, and became
<lb/>Exalted over those philosophers.
<lb/>None was so learned in astrology.
<lb/>In leechcraft he excelled <note>Reading with P.</note> and spoke with ease
<lb/>Of conduct, government, and policies.
</p>



</div>  

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>The first Banquet of Nushirwan to the Sages, and the Counsels of Buzurjmihr</head>
<p><pb n="287"/>
<lb/>The board was spread one day. The Shah commanded:
<lb/><q>Bid the archmages come, the learned, the curious,
<lb/>The eloquent, the prudent, and observing.</q>
<lb/>The archmages vigilant of heart, the chiefs
<lb/>That were accomplished in all knowledge, came,
<lb/>And, having feasted, called for wine and drank
<lb/>Until their spirits rose, not bringing wisdom
<lb/>To disrepute but to refresh their souls.
<lb/>The prudent Shah said to those men of lore:
<lb/><q>Display the hidden knowledge that ye have;
<lb/>Let every one possessed of understanding
<lb/>Within his heart hold forth and pleasure me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The wise men bold and mighty in discourse
<lb/>Set loose their tongues in presence of the king,
<lb/>Both young and old, as he required of them.
<lb/>When Buzurjmihr had listened to their words,
<lb/>And noted that the Shah held knowledge dear,
<lb/>He rose, did reverence, and said: <q>Just judge!
<lb/>Be earth the bondslave of thine ivory throne,
<lb/>Heaven lustrous with the Glory of thy crown.
<lb/>If now the Shah shall bid his slave unlock
<lb/>His tongue then I will speak although unworthy,
<lb/>And, in respect of knowledge, least of all.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1661"/>
<lb/>No wise man can be blamed for having loosed:
<lb/>His tongue in presence of Shah Nushirwan.</q>
<lb/>The monarch looked upon the sage and said:
<lb/><q>What reason can there be for hiding knowledge?</q>
<lb/>The youth forthwith displayed his mastery,
<lb/>And spread light round him while his eloquence
<lb/>And counsels fixed the archimages’ hearts.
</p>
<pb n="288"/>

<p>
<lb/>He first displayed his gifts in praise of God,
<lb/>And then proceeded: <q>One whose mind is clear
<lb/>Will utter much in little; hasty folk
<lb/>Are talkative and tedious. When fools' talk
<lb/>Endureth long the speaker is despised.
<lb/>Seek worth and not 'addition, for the world
<lb/>Is fleeting, and we are but sojourners.
<lb/>Were our days to endure forevermore
<lb/>The world would have too many candidates.
<lb/>While here below humanity is best,
<lb/>And knowledge in that view will not gainsay thee.
<lb/>Our inward light we owe to righteousness,
<lb/>And we must weep o’er darkness and chicane.
<lb/>The heart of every one is slave to passion,
<lb/>Which differeth with each, and in the world
<lb/>Each hath his humour; it is well that thou
<lb/>Conform therewith. All foremost in affairs
<lb/>Still will be scheming and endeavouring more,
<lb/>But sages, scholars, and the inly blest
<lb/>Dwell here below and set their hearts above.
<lb/>Vex not thyself about the unattained;
<lb/>Tis toil of body and distress of soul.
<lb/>He that is strong will act straightforwardly,
<lb/>But lies and double-dealing come of weakness.
<lb/>If thou lack knowledge silence is the jewel,
<lb/>While if thou art in love with thine own knowledge
<lb/>Debate will take that wisdom out of thee.
<lb/>Rich is the man that hath not greed, and blest
<lb/>Is he that hath not covetise for mate.
<lb/>Humanity is brother unto wisdom,
<lb/>Which is as 'twere the crown upon the soul.
<lb/>To have a sage for mortal enemy
<lb/>Is better for thee than a fool for friend.
<lb/>The man content is rich; he putteth greed
<lb/>And care in bonds. Thou wilt give ear to sages
<lb/>If thou art humble in thy wish to learn.

<pb n="289"/>


<lb/>When one is masterful in counselling
<lb/>Men falter not in action. Let the man
<lb/>That hath forgot his knowledge hold his tongue.
<lb/>When thou hast wealth in hand with gold and silver,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1662"/>
<lb/>And steeds caparisoned, in daily cost
<lb/>Be neither close nor lavish. Choose the mean,
<lb/>And let thine only guide be rectitude.
<lb/>The wise man keepeth foes afar, and they
<lb/>Become his servants. Know thou, he that doth
<lb/>His best will win in war. Speak not vain words,
<lb/>For from that fire ensueth naught but smoke.
<lb/>Spend not thy thoughts upon what ne'er can be,
<lb/>Because with water thou canst pierce not iron.
<lb/>A king if he be learned is humble too
<lb/>Though knowledge make him great and powerful.
<lb/>He that acknowledgeth God's handiwork
<lb/>Hath passed the ills of fortune; he will serve
<lb/>God more and more, cast out the Div's suggestions,
<lb/>Refrain himself from what should not be done,
<lb/>Afflict not those that should be unafflicted,
<lb/>And in the last resort incline to God,
<lb/>Who is our Nourisher and Fosterer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Now at that goodly speech of Buzurjmihr
<lb/>The doctors all grew fresh of countenance,
<lb/>Rose in the presence of the king of kings,
<lb/>And proffered praise anew. The company
<lb/>Were all astound at Buzurjmihr, that one
<lb/>So young should rise so high. The world-lord marvelled
<lb/>At him, then summoned the chief registrars,
<lb/>And bade them set his name first on the roll:
<lb/>His fortune shone forth like the sun in heaven.
<lb/>Again the archmages entered on discourse,
<lb/>While all the sages were in wonderment;
<lb/>The youth set loose his tongue, for he was pure
<lb/>Of heart and of an ardent soul, and thus

<pb n="290"/>


<lb/>He said: <q>We must not even in our thoughts
<lb/>Turn from the king, the righteous judge, for he
<lb/>Is as the shepherd and we are the sheep;
<lb/>Again, we are the earth, he is high heaven.
<lb/>We must not quit our fealty to him,
<lb/>Must not renounce his way and ordinance,
<lb/>But joy when he is glad, if we are fain
<lb/>To proffer to him all the age's due,
<lb/>Diffuse his excellences in the world,
<lb/>But keep his confidence inviolate.
<lb/>Presume not thou upon his dignity,
<lb/>For e'en the lion's heart is frayed by fire.
<lb/>We should call e'en a mountain that despised
<lb/>His bidding foolish-hearted and light-witted.
<lb/>All evil and all good come from the Shah,
<lb/>From him come bond and dungeon, crown and throne.
<lb/>The world hath from his love its worth and Grace,
<lb/>While at his wrath our livers seethe within us.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1663"/>
<lb/>The crowned head is the Grace of God, the sage
<lb/>Hath joy and mirth therefrom. Of Ahriman
<lb/>Is he that joyeth not; his heart and brain
<lb/>Are cultured not with knowledge.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They gave ear
<lb/>To what the young man said, and those outworn
<lb/>Revived in soul. With tongues and mouths all praise
<lb/>That mighty convocation went its ways.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>The second Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and the Archimages</head>
<p>
<lb/>A se'nnight passed. That king of ardent heart
<lb/>Convoked the wise and shelved the world’s affairs
<lb/>Because he wished to hear the words of sages—
<pb n="291"/>
<lb/>Those that were worthy to be called to court,
<lb/>And were approved by knowledge to the Shah.
<lb/>They came, the wise in utterance, both young
<lb/>And elders of experience. With the doctors
<lb/>Of ardent soul fared youthful Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>The exalted one. These doctors sage and shrewd
<lb/>Sat near the lofty throne and turned their looks
<lb/>On Buzurjmihr because at him the face
<lb/>Of Nushirwan grew bright. One of the wisest
<lb/>Then questioned him concerning fate and fortune:
<lb/><q>What is their character and who ordained them?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>One aspireth, being young.
<lb/>He toileth night and day, and yet his path
<lb/>Is dark and narrow and his conduit low,
<lb/>While some mere dolt will sleep on fortune’s throne,
<lb/>And rose-trees scatter roses over him.
<lb/>Such is the character of fate and fortune,
<lb/>No toil avoideth their apportionment;
<lb/>The World-lord, the All-wise, our Fosterer,
<lb/>Hath fashioned thus the star of destiny.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>What man attaineth greatness?
<lb/>To whom is high estate the most becoming?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>The man that hath the better knowledge
<lb/>Of what is good and putteth it in practice.</q>
<lb/>Another said: <q>What is there best in us?
<lb/>Who from the world is worthiest of good?</q><note>Reading with P.</note>


<pb n="290"/>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Gentleness, munificence,
<lb/>With magnanimity and courteousness.
<lb/>The humble man who boweth down his neck;
<lb/>His hand will give, expecting no return;
<lb/>He toileth and by toil would win the world,
<lb/>And keepeth step with fellow wayfarers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>What is the special virtue of the sage,</q>
<lb/>Another said, <q>in moments of dispute?</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1664"/>
<lb/>He answered: <q>To discern when he is wrong,
<lb/>And modify his methods and his views.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another one inquired: <q>How should one act
<lb/>To make existence more endurable?</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>Whensoe'er the heart
<lb/>Is fraught with wisdom there is gladness too.
<lb/>Then will the man both give and take aright,
<lb/>And shut the door of fraud and knavery,
<lb/>Will pardon faults whene'er he hath the power,
<lb/>And not be hasty or irascible.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another asked of him: <q>Among the folk
<lb/>Who is best able to command himself?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>The man that is not led by passion
<lb/>Away from nobleness and native worth,
<lb/>And likewise he that can command his weakness,
<lb/>Aware that evils follow on excess.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>Is there aught anywhere
<lb/>More excellent than bounty and good nature?
<lb/>Who bringeth speedily his crop to fruit,
<lb/>And furnisheth two springtides in a year?</q>
<lb/><q>One,</q> thus he made reply, <q>that all unasked
<lb/>Doth deck his soul with generosity,
<lb/>But one that hath the praise of the receiver
<lb/>Regard him not as giving but as trading.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>What are the adornments of a man,
<lb/>And which is noblest?</q>
<lb/>Buzurjmihr replied:
<lb/><q>He that is bounteous toward a worthy object;
<lb/>He towereth like a cypress in a garden,
<lb/>And never withereth, but one unworthy,
<lb/>Though he be set in musk, will savour not;
<lb/>No flower will grow upon that arid thorn.
<lb/>To question of the dumb or of the deaf,
<lb/>Though thou art justified, is profitless.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>Within this Wayside Inn,</q> another said,
<lb/><q>The sage is not exempt from pain and trouble.
    <pb n="293"/>
<lb/>How shall we act that we may win fair fame,
<lb/>And so begin that nobly we may end?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Keep from sin; treat all the world
<lb/>As though it were thyself; what thou mislikest
<lb/>Inflict not on another—friend or foe.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>Which sayest thou of the twain
<lb/>Is better—labour moderate or great?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>From wisdom's standpoint thought
<lb/>Alone is worthy. If thou needest fruit
<lb/>Toil in proportion to the work in hand.</q>
<lb/><q>If we must weep o'er those that are to blame,</q>
<lb/>Another asked, <q>who can deserve our praise?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>Whoever hath the most
<lb/>Of hope and fear and awe of holy God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>O thou illustrious
<lb/>In wisdom and whose head out-toppeth heaven!
<lb/>What is the goodliest destiny for me
<lb/>From this exalted and unstable sky?</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1665"/>
<lb/>That man of eloquence made answer: <q>His
<lb/>Who is secure and is exempt from need;
<lb/>Him fortune treateth with benevolence
<lb/>So long as he is just in all his ways.</q>
<lb/><q>What is the knowledge,</q> asked another one,
<lb/><q>Whereby I may be happy in the world?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>That of the patient man,
<lb/>Who holdeth in contempt the impudent,
<lb/>And his whose brain is not perturbed by wrath,
<lb/>And who, though wroth, will wink at others' faults.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another asked: <q>What man is he, O sage!
<lb/>That winneth the approval of the wise?</q>
<lb/>Said Buzurjmihr: <q>The man whom wisdom feedeth,
<lb/>Who mourneth not the lost but giveth up
<lb/>His darling to the dust without regret,
<lb/>Pain, or dismay, rejecteth empty hopes
<pb n="294"/>
<lb/>Like willow's fruit, is always glad and gay,
<lb/>And careless of the processes of time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>What are the faults of kings
<lb/>Whereby the hearts of righteous men are saddened?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Wise men say that there are four:
<lb/>The first is terror of the foe in fight;
<lb/>The second being niggardly in giving;
<lb/>The third rejecting wise advice in war;
<lb/>The fourth is hastiness of temperament,
<lb/>And sleeping not upon their purposes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another one inquired: <q>What man is faultless,
<lb/>And what is there to blame in noble men?</q>
<lb/><q>We call one upright,</q> thus said Buzurjmihr,
<lb/><q>When wisdom beareth witness to his words,
<lb/>While those that seek by cunning and injustice
<lb/>To shine are blamed for falsehood and deceit.
<lb/>Between them is the man of violence,
<lb/>Abusive, with his head fulfilled with strife,
<lb/>And who, though meek and humble with the king,
<lb/>Yet madly persecuteth holy men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>What kind of character
<lb/>Will profit him that seeketh not mishap?</q>
<lb/><q>The speaker of the truth is true in all
<lb/>His deeds,</q> he answered, <q>governeth his tongue,
<lb/>Is modest, and soft-voiced amidst of clamour.
<lb/>Best is the sage who holdeth it unmeet
<lb/>To banish wisdom for the sake of passion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another sage inquired: <q>Who is the man
<lb/>That can without mishap transact affairs,
<lb/>Tend his own life, and profit kith and kin?</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>He that from the first
<lb/>Hath known and sought the door of holy God—



<lb/>The Source of thy thanksgivings and thy Refuge,
<lb/>The Lord of day and night, of sun and moon.
<lb/>Moreover heartily he must obey
<lb/>The Shah’s behests in public and in private,
<pb n="295"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1666"/>
<lb/>Tend his own person dearly and shut fast
<lb/>Thereon the door of travail and of greed,
<lb/>Must care for his own kindred, feed the poor,
<lb/>And give his children teachers, for the world
<lb/>Must not be trusted to the ignorant,
<lb/>And when a son is docile to command
<lb/>Tis for the father to make much of him.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>What is the place an upright son should hold,</q>
<lb/>Another asked him, <q>in his sire’s esteem?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>In his father’s eyes
<lb/>A glorious son is dear as life itself:
<lb/>The father’s name abideth after death
<lb/>Because the son will say: <q>My father taught me.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another asked: <q>What dost thou see in riches
<lb/>To grace the heart?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He made reply: <q>The man
<lb/>Of wealth is honoured though the wealth is vile;
<lb/>But there is much that is bound up therewith,
<lb/>Take heed that thou misprize not these my words,
<lb/>For, first, whate’er thou hast a mind unto
<lb/>Will by its nature show if thine be good;
<lb/>And, next, for thee to have and not employ
<lb/>Is to treat stones and royal gems as one.</q>
<lb/><q>Among the kings with fame and lofty crown,</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said, <q>whom callest thou the best?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>That king,</q> he made reply, <q>with whom the good
<lb/>Dwell safely while the bad quake at his voice:
<lb/>The earth reposeth underneath his throne.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: <q>What maketh a man rich,
<lb/>And who in this world is distressed and poor?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus replied: <q>The man that is content
<lb/>With what the Master of high heaven bestoweth,
<lb/>While for the man whom fortune favoureth not
<lb/>There is not any evil worse than greed.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The famous men were full of wonderment
<lb/>At him and lauded him with one consent.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>The third Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and
the Archimages</head>
<p><pb n="296"/>
<lb/>A se'nnight passed. The eighth day with the dawn
<lb/>The all-conquering Shah sat on his throne and summoned
<lb/>Before him all the men of understanding,
<lb/>The wise and eloquent, who all discoursed
<lb/>At large, but truly none much pleased the Shah,
<lb/>Who after said to Buzurjmihr: <q>Unveil
<lb/>Thy shamefast face.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That fluent sage set loose
<lb/>His tongue, displayed his varied lore, and first
<lb/>He blessed the Shah, and said: <q>Be this crowned head
<lb/>Victorious,</q> adding: <q>None becometh great
<lb/>Unless he shun the pathway of mishap.
<lb/>If thou wouldst rise to greatness by thy knowledge
<lb/>Thou needest wisdom in thy choice of words.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1667"/>
<lb/>In quest of fame one must be brave, the age
<lb/>Rejecteth faint-hearts. If thou seek’st the throne
<lb/>Accomplishments are needed since the bough
<lb/>That putteth forth its green must bear thee fruit.
<lb/>When folk make question of accomplishments
<lb/>Tis vain to cite mere aptitude,<note n="1">Or <gloss>high lineage.</gloss></note> for that,
<lb/>With these to seek, is not approved and worthless.
<lb/>In dealing with this point a wise man said:—
<lb/><q>If roses savour not forbear to speak
<lb/>Of colour; none in fire a stream will seek.</q>
<lb/>A king is all the richer for his bounty,
<lb/>And hath no credit for his secret treasures.
<lb/>If thou hast claimed attainments justify
<lb/>What thou hast fairly spoken by thy deeds.
<lb/>The sage is happy being fed by heaven
<pb n="297"/>
<lb/>With wisdom, and the man of simple heart
<lb/>Because 'tis free from all deceitfulness.
<lb/>In this world wisdom is a trusty tree,
<lb/>And the great king’s heart is its first of fruits.
<lb/>Thou wilt be easy if thou art content,
<lb/>But practise greed and thou wilt quake therefor.
<lb/>Do not thy kindness in the sight of men,
<lb/>For thou wilt have small kindness in return.
<lb/>Good fortune favoureth the open-hearted,
<lb/>And he is blest who beareth patiently.
<lb/>Still if a man would rise he must be furnished
<lb/>With certain things to aid him in the struggle.
<lb/>First, rede and erudition; secondly,
<lb/>A ripe experience; thirdly, friends to help
<lb/>In time of action and to estimate
<lb/>The chances every way for good and ill,
<lb/>And to be profitable afterward.
<lb/>In everyday life and emergencies.
<lb/>He needeth, fourthly, rectitude and wisdom
<lb/>To purge his heart of falsehood and of fraud,
<lb/>And, fifthly, if thou art possessed of strength
<lb/>Toil with thy body; greatness will result. <note n="2">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The strong unless they labour ne'er will reach
<lb/>The height of their desires, but over-toil,
<lb/>Know, endeth in despair. I will set forth
<lb/>The five characteristics of the sage,
<lb/>Which to observe involve him not in trouble,
<lb/>With seven too of the fool, and 'tis no marvel
<lb/>If he be irked thereby: and, to begin,
<lb/>No sage is vexed at loss or prematurely
<lb/>Is glad, for disappointment will perturb him.
<lb/>He counteth not upon the unattained
<lb/>So as to break his heart if he should miss it.
<lb/>He neither hopeth that which ne'er can be,
<lb/>Nor saith: <q>The willow-bough will bring forth fruit.</q>
<pb n="298"/>
<lb/>When at his ease from travail and from ill
<lb/>He recketh of the future, wherefore when
<lb/>Time bringeth hardship on him he will prove
<lb/>Beforehand and not slack in enterprise.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1668"/>
<lb/>The fool’s way, as I said, is sevenfold:
<lb/>His wrath is kindled with the innocent,
<lb/>His treasure opened to the unworthy man
<lb/>Without return of meed or recompense,
<lb/>While, thirdly, he is an ingrate to God,
<lb/>And is not wise and cognizant of good,
<lb/>But, fourthly, talketh loudly of himself
<lb/>To every one and, fifthly, is involved
<lb/>In pain and loss through his own feckless words;
<lb/>He trusteth, sixthly, to untrusty folk,
<lb/>Expecting thorns to bear him painted silk,
<lb/>And, lastly, uttereth lies in argument,
<lb/>Endeavouring to shine by impudence.
<lb/>Know this, O thou exalted sovereign!
<lb/>That no man getteth aught but harm from ill.
<lb/>When any one is mute in company
<lb/>That silence is melodious to the heart.
<lb/>By hearing some one wise and eloquent
<lb/>Thou wilt get provand for thy body, counsel
<lb/>And prudence for thy heart. Forget not thou
<lb/>Such words because they crown the throne of knowledge.
<lb/>If thou wouldst bring that knowledge into bearing
<lb/>Release thy jewel from its case by speech,
<lb/>And if thou wouldst extend thy fame draw forth
<lb/>Thy tongue as 'twere a falchion from its sheath;
<lb/>But if thou holdest session with the unwise" <note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The under then will have the upper hand.
<lb/>By knowledge are the soul and heart illumined;
<lb/>See thou go not about to compass lies.
<lb/>When one of eloquence is holding forth
<lb/>Abide his words, be not impatient;
<pb n="299"/>
<lb/>Thou mayst get wisdom from his utterances,
<lb/>And afterwards repeat what thou hast heard.
<lb/>Use not thy wisdom as a means of gain
<lb/>Though not to do so may result in hardship.
<lb/>With heart and tongue in an accord of right
<lb/>The door of loss is barred on every side.
<lb/>Oh! may the heart of Nushirwan, the Shah,
<lb/>Be open to instruction evermore.</q>
</p>
<p>An archimage of subtle intellect
<lb/>Then asked: <q>What are the good and seemly things
<lb/>That give a man a lustre in the world,
<lb/>And quittance from the troubles of the time?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>Whoe'er attaineth wisdom
<lb/>Will gain thereby the fruitage of both worlds.</q>
<lb/><q>But if he hath not wisdom,</q> said the archmage,
<lb/><q>Since wisdom is God’s radiant robe of honour?</q>
</p>
<p>Said Buzurjmihr: <q>Then knowledge is the best,
<lb/>The learned is mighty midst the men of might.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/><q>But if,</q> the archmage said, <q>he hath not sought
<lb/>That stream and never bathed his soul therein?</q>
<lb/>Thus Buzurjmihr replied: <q>The warrior
<lb/>Must count his body as a worthless thing,
<lb/>And if he striveth in the day of battle,
<lb/>And layeth foemen’s heads upon the dust,
<lb/>He will be cherished in the great king’s heart,
<lb/>For ever happy and in good command.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1669"/>
<lb/><q>But if one is not valiant,</q> said the archimage,
<lb/><q>Nor seeketh after knowledge, law, and Faith?</q>
</p>
<p>Then Buzurjmihr replied: <q>'Twere well that death
<lb/>Should set the helm of darkness on his head.</q>
</p>
<p>Another asked: <q>How shall we act that all
<lb/>Of us may eat the fruitage of the tree
<lb/>Set by the sage within the garth of spring,
<lb/>And walk moreover underneath its shade?</q>
</p>
<p>Said Buzurjmihr: <q>The man that barreth up
<lb/>His tongue from evil vexeth not his soul,
<pb n="300"/>
<lb/>And rendeth not in talk another’s skin.
<lb/>He will be likewise friends with all the folk,




<lb/>All troubles will be smoothed away for him,
<lb/>And enemy and friend will be as one.</q></p>

<p>Another asked him, saying: <q>Are the men
<lb/>That shun the way of failure great or good?</q></p>

<p>Thus Buzurjmihr replied: <q>An evil deed
<lb/>Is like a tree that beareth evil fruit.
<lb/>Thus if a man speak gently with his tongue
<lb/>But little harshness will befall his ear,
<lb/>For know it is the tongue that troubleth men;
<lb/>So if thou wouldst be easy weigh thy words.
<lb/>The man of few words and a loyal subject
<lb/>Hath only one fit post—before the throne.
<lb/>Moreover he escapeth ills not come,
<lb/>As bird or beast escapeth from the net,
<lb/>While furthermore he triumpheth o’er evil,
<lb/>Is self-controlled and wise exceedingly.
<lb/>He leaveth well alone and troubleth not
<lb/>The inoffensive, letteth no good 'scape him,
<lb/>And counteth not upon the days to come.
<lb/>He shunneth foe with more than quarry’s speed,
<lb/>And cleaveth unto friend like shaft and feather.
<lb/>For any pleasure that will end in grief
<lb/>The man of wisdom hath but little yearning.
<lb/>Put ease and indolence afar from thee,
<lb/>Take pains and make a feast of toil; without it
<lb/>Thou wilt win not addition in the world;
<lb/>There is no treasure for the indolent. <note n="1">The two following couplets are transposed.</note>
<lb/>May this world live in Nushirwan, be he
<lb/>Its world-lord ever and his fortune young.</q></p>

<p>They held discourse at large upon this theme:
<lb/>The hearts of those grown drowsy were awakened.
<lb/>The archimages, magnates, and shrewd sages
<lb/>Blessed Buzurjmihr and gave the Shah great praise,
<lb/>Then went rejoicing on their several ways.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>The fourth Banquet of Nishirwan to Bizurjmihr and
the Archimages</head>
<p><pb n="301"/>
<lb/>Two se’nnights passed away and then the Shah
<lb/>Relinquished public business for a day,
<lb/>And bade the archimages and great men
<lb/>Assemble at the palace with the sages.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1670"/>
<lb/>He asked about the body and its birth,
<lb/>About wrath, peace, the intellect, and justice,
<lb/>About the sovereignty, the crown, and power,
<lb/>And how good fortune doth begin and end.
<lb/>He questioned those archimages and inquired
<lb/>Concerning that which pleased him. When the others
<lb/>Had spoken as their knowledge was, but failed
<lb/>To gratify the Shah, he next addressed
<lb/>Himself to Bazurjmihr and said: <q> Bring forth
<lb/>The splendid jewel from its hiding-place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Bizurjmihr gave praises, saying thus :
<lb/><q>O Shah most loving and serene of heart !</q>
<lb/>Know that in all the world no king like thee
<lb/>For justice, understanding, crown, and throne,
<lb/>For Grace and mien, for counsel and for fortune,
<lb/>Hath set the diadem upon his head.
<lb/>The king that exerciseth self-control
<lb/>Will be at rest from vengeance and from war
<lb/>Because to shun unwarrantable deeds
<lb/>Is better than to get a sorry heart.
<lb/>How goodly is the saying of the sage :—
<lb/><q>Self-discipline is goodly in a king.</q>
<lb/>In seasons of dispute he feareth God,
<lb/>Inclineth not to vengeance and to prowess,
<lb/>And maketh wisdom ruler of his passions
<lb/>When he is choleric. A monarch’s thoughts
<lb/>Should not displease the Master of the world
<pb n="302"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1671"/>

<lb/>Through whom he doth discern ’twixt good and evil,
<lb/>And seeketh Paradise as virtue’s meed.
<lb/>A tongue truth-speaking and a reverent heart
<lb/>Will be his glory in the world for aye,
<lb/>While every one that is his counsellor
<lb/>Will be a man of weight among the people,
<lb/>Be eloquent, serene of heart, and just,
<lb/>And give to small and great alike their due
<lb/>According to the measure of their states.
<lb/>The man that is the servant of the Shah
<lb/>Should not be damnified on that account,
<lb/>And while a monarch holdeth sages dear
<lb/>His crown will be exalted ; but if he
<lb/>Shall take the counsel of the ignorant
<lb/>He will bring down his crown’s head underfoot,
<lb/>For knowledge frighteneth the fool away,
<lb/>Who in his ignorance is combative.
<lb/>The world-lord, whose informants are all wise,
<lb/>Aware of what is going on at court,
<lb/>And able thus to foil the malcontent,
<lb/>Will be still glorious. None must sleep aggrieved
<lb/>Lest ill befall the Shah from that mishap,
<lb/>Who should ban him deserving chastisement,
<lb/>The misbegotten and the ill-disposed,
<lb/>Lest such should trouble those that are offenceless.
<lb/>All captives in the prisons of the Shah,
<lb/>The guilty and the innocent alike,
<lb/>Should be enlarged by the decree of God,
<lb/>Who thus directed in the Zandavasta.
<lb/>If one be an ill-doer black and base
<lb/>The face of earth should be relieved of him,
<lb/>For while his evil day continueth
<lb/>He will bring ruin on the homes of men.
<lb/>The world-lord must rejoice in faith and right
<lb/>So long as he is in the world as Shah.
<pb n="303"/>

<lb/><q>Tis his to cleanse it from the wicked Div
<lb/>In public and in private by the sword.
<lb/>The king that ruleth his troops well will be
<lb/>Untroubled by the griefs of suppliants.
<lb/>When thou art wary of-thy foes in counsel
<lb/>Thine evil-wishers will lose heart. Man all
<lb/>The breaches of the realm ere war betide.
<lb/>Whenas the Shah is blamed for anything
<lb/>Reproach too falleth on the crown and throne,
<lb/>Through grief the wish is to be quit of him,
<lb/>And to make wisdom testify thereto.
<lb/>Let grow the love thou bearest to thy son,
<lb/>Who is as ’twere the reflex of thy face
<lb/>In water. Teach him wisdom and good sense,
<lb/>And seek but to illuminate his soul.
<lb/>Unlock for him the portal of thy treasures ;
<lb/>He must have no cause to bewail himself,
<lb/>And when he putteth forth his hand to wrong
<lb/>There is no need to break the prince’s heart.
<lb/>Recall him to the way with gentleness,
<lb/>And keep a hold upon him from the first.
<lb/>If in his heart thou find hostility
<lb/>Tt is an ill weed ; pluck it from his plot,
<lb/>For if it bideth ’twill grow strong and fill
<lb/>The garden of the sovereignty with tares ;
<lb/>But when the atheling hath Grace and sense
<lb/>He must not hear the words of evil speakers ;
<lb/>Still when the hand can reach the miscreants
<lb/>Haste not to bloodshed save at God’s command.
<lb/>Destruction cometh on the royal crown
<lb/>Through rascal-ministers and wicked wives.
<lb/>Give fools a hearing, but when they propose
<lb/>An unjust action do not thou consent.
<lb/>Tis needful to fulfil all righteousness,
<lb/>And clear thine own heart of perversity.
<lb/>The sole adornment for the mighty Shah
<pb n="304"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1672"/>

<lb/>Is right, for ’tis the Div that causeth wrong.
<lb/>Now when the Shah shall hearken to these words
<lb/>He in his heart will witness unto wisdom,
<lb/>The crown will call down blessings on the king,
<lb/>The throne of empire be confirmed to him,
<lb/>Both will rejoice in him, his foes despair
<lb/>Of fortune ; while this restless sky revolveth
<lb/>His good name will be his memorial.
<lb/>Now may the accomplished soul of Nushirwan
<lb/>Be young while day endureth.</q>
<lb/>At his words
<lb/>The assembly was amazed, compared with them
<lb/>The counsels of the wise seemed lustreless.
<lb/>When Nishirwan had listened to this speech
<lb/>His greatness greatened great although it was.
<lb/>The counsels given filled his eyes with tears :
<lb/>He filled the speaker’s mouth with lustrous pearls.
<lb/>Then from the palace with their lips all praise
<lb/>The company departed on their ways.

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>The fifth Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and
the Archimages</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thus seven days passed away. Upon the eighth,
<lb/>Whenas the world-illuming sun blazed forth,
<lb/>Put off its robe of lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>And decked the world with golden-hued brocade,
<lb/>The king of kings sat with the archimages,
<lb/>The veterans, and officers of state—
<lb/>Ardshir, the high priest and the chief of nobles,
<lb/>Shapur and Yazdagird, the scribe, the men
<lb/>Of science and the readers of the stars,
<lb/>The wise, the enlightened, and the eloquent.
<lb/>The youthful Buzurjmihr, the orator,
<pb n="305"/>

<lb/>Came to the presence of Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And did obeisance to his sovereign,
<lb/>Who joyed at him and thus addressed the sages :—
<lb/><q>Who wotteth aught whereby the Faith of God
<lb/>May be confirmed, the royal throne kept scathless ?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thereat the high priest loosed his tongue amid
<lb/>The chiefs and said: <q>The justice of the Shah
<lb/>Will cause his Grace, his crown, and throne to shine,
<lb/>And when it openeth his treasury-door
<lb/>His high renown will last when he is dead.
<lb/>Moreover, he should purge his tongue of lies,
<lb/>And seek not lustre in the world by guile.
<lb/>Next he will be both just and merciful,
<lb/>And make his throne the glory of the age.
<lb/>Then too the head of the illustrious Shah
<lb/>Should be not wrathful with an erring liege,
<lb/>And, fifthly, he will speak so that his fame
<lb/>In this world never will grow obsolete;
<lb/>He will speak truth in all things small and great,
<lb/>And never derogate in any thing.
<lb/>He will esteem withal as his own fortune
<lb/>The servant of his throne. If wise in words
<lb/>His speech will be convincing, and his heart
<lb/>Never satiate of learning and consuming
<lb/>His brains with thought. All men are set at large
<lb/>By wisdom and have little cause to wail
<lb/>At fortune. Wisdom nourisheth the souls
<lb/>Of sages, wisdom pointeth out the way
<lb/>To those that seek. Tear not thy heart, O Shah!
<lb/>From wisdom’s path, for wisdom fostereth
<lb/>Fame and a noble end. Base and a fool
<lb/>Is he that ever said: <q>I am the man,
<lb/>Because there is no peer to me in knowledge.</q></q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1673"/>
<lb/>Then Yazdagird, the scribe, spake thus and said:—
<lb/><q>O wise and wisdom-loving Shah! in Shahs
<lb/>It is a thing unseemly to shed blood,
<pb n="306"/>

<lb/>Or suffer trifles to disturb the heart.
<lb/>Moreover, when the king is light of wit
<lb/>He putteth hand to matters thoughtlessly,
<lb/>While, further, he is hasty with the wise,
<lb/>And all the more so through his ignorance.
<lb/>When lust for vengeance hath possessed his heart
<lb/>The Div is the associate of his soul;
<lb/>So too a judge’s words, if he be hasty,
<lb/>Lead not to fair results. The warrior,
<lb/>Moreover, that is fearful of his life
<lb/>In battle-time, not of disgrace, and he
<lb/>Whose heart, though he be rich, is mean and narrow,
<lb/>Were better hidden underneath the ground.
<lb/>Authority becometh not a beggar,
<lb/>Since he himself becometh not high rank.
<lb/>A guileful elder is a hateful thing,
<lb/>And after death his soul will be in fire.
<lb/>When any youth is slack in business
<lb/>The heart of fortune will grow sick of him,
<lb/>Disease will make him prematurely old,
<lb/>And may his vigour and his spirit cease.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When Buzurjmihr had heard these goodly words,
<lb/>And had adorned his brain with wisdom’s lore,
<lb/>He said: <q>O Shah whose face is like the sun’s!
<lb/>May shining heaven be at thy dispose.
<lb/>Know this: that men of wisdom will sustain
<lb/>Their souls with knowledge since the hearts of stones
<lb/>And mountains sorrow o’er the ignorant,
<lb/>For none respecteth him. He knoweth not
<lb/>End from beginning, fame from infamy.
<lb/>The common folk, still more the wisdom-seekers,
<lb/>Despise the doings of such men as these—
<lb/>The lying judge unhonoured by the sage;
<lb/>The general who guardeth well his treasure,
<lb/>And is abandoned by his toil-worn troops;
<lb/>The sage that feareth not to do amiss
<pb n="307"/>

<lb/>If he can have enjoyment therewithal:
<lb/>The leech that aileth; how can he cure others?
<lb/>The mendicant that braggeth of his wealth
<lb/>While that whereof he talketh is but naught;
<lb/>A Shah who letteth not his people rest,
<lb/>Or sleep at night, disquieting their hearts,
<lb/>And yet when favouring breezes blow on thee
<lb/>Assumeth all the merit for himself;
<lb/>A choleric sage who eyeth others’ goods,
<lb/>And lastly he that counselleth a fool,
<lb/>Or giveth the indolent authority.
<lb/>They that lack wisdom and acquire it not
<lb/>Will have occasion to repent their words.
<lb/>The heart of any man, my gracious lord!
<lb/>That hath not wisdom wrestleth with desire
<lb/>In such wise as a flame devoureth brimstone,
<lb/>Or maketh provand of a bed of reeds.
<lb/>Long live the heart of Nushirwan, may he
<lb/>Have this world’s chiefs his servitors to be.</q>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>The sixth Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and
the Archimages</head>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah allowed another week to pass,
<lb/>Then issued orders to prepare the court,
<lb/>Came and assumed his seat upon the throne
<lb/>Of gold, with armlets, crown, and golden girdle.
<lb/>On one hand was the archmage that was vizir,
<lb/>And on the other Yazdagird the scribe,
<lb/>While round him were the other archimages,
<lb/>The chiefs, and Buzurjmihr the eloquent,
<lb/>To whom the Shah: <q>Why keep the jewels hidden—
<lb/>Those words which are a profit to the soul,
<lb/>And make the unprized man of high estate?
<lb/>The speaker’s treasure is not minished,
<lb/>While ’tis a pleasure to the listener.</q>
<pb n="308"/>

</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thus spake the archimage to Buzurjmihr:—
<lb/><q>O thou more famous than the turning sky!
<lb/>Know’st thou the thing whose more will harm, whose less
<lb/>Will strengthen thee?</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer, saying:—
<lb/><q>By eating less thou wilt be easier
<lb/>In body and withal feed up thy soul,
<lb/>But by too much well-doing wilt advance
<lb/>Thy rival.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then said Yazdagird, the scribe:—
<lb/><q>O man of eloquence and heedful mind!
<lb/>What are the heart’s three <note n="1" resp="P">Reading with P.</note> secret blemishes
<lb/>Which men retain although they need them not?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>In the first place thou must purge
<lb/>Thy heart of all censoriousness, for none
<lb/>In this world publicly or privily
<lb/>Is free from fault. A chieftain, jealous of thee, 
<lb/>Will weep<note n="2">With envy.</note> on growing thine inferior,
<lb/>While, thirdly, he that is a slanderer—
<lb/>The man of double face—endeavoureth
<lb/>To raise dust e’en from water.<note n="3">Three couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>Then the archmage
<lb/>Inquired: <q>O thou that art supreme in knowledge!
<lb/>None in this world is franchised from desire,
<lb/>Which may be hidden or exposed to all.
<lb/>Supposing ways to gratify it open,
<lb/>So that ’tis manifestly in one’s power,
<lb/>In my case which way will advantage me,
<lb/>And which result in travail, pain, and loss?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus and said: <q>The ways are twain,
<lb/>And thou canst journey either at thy choice.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1675"/>
<lb/>One is the way of rashness, full of ill,
<pb n="309"/>

<lb/>The other that of wisdom and well-doing,</q><note>Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>And therein wisdom is the guide for thee—
<lb/>A fact that is beyond all questioning.
<lb/>God’s robe of honour is upon the sage;
<lb/>Observe what man is worthy of that gift.
<lb/>No one will purchase one of giant strength
<lb/>Devoid of wisdom. In defect thereof
<lb/>It is not well to live, for God is witness
<lb/>That wisdom is the very life of life.
<lb/>The man that hath acquired a base of knowledge
<lb/>Is fitted for the warfare and the struggle.
<lb/>First, let thy knowledge make thee turn to God,
<lb/>Who is and who will be for evermore.
<lb/>By faith in Him thou hast thy heart’s desire,
<lb/>And hast attained the goal whereto thou spedest.
<lb/>Another point of knowledge is that thou
<lb/>Shouldst use discretion in the choice of food.
<lb/>Strive after purity in food and raiment,
<lb/>And thus uphold the ordinance of God.
<lb/>When thou hast need to earn thy daily bread
<lb/>Run not to misers for their help and treasure,
<lb/>But let thy choice be of some business
<lb/>Whose reputation will not sink repute.
<lb/>Make to thyself a friend of some great man,
<lb/>Who can assist thee when thou art in straits.
<lb/>Be silent when thou art in company
<lb/>If thou wouldst win the praise of every one,
<lb/>But if thou speak’st speak that which hast learned,
<lb/>And branded on thy liver. Weigh thy words,
<lb/>Not the dinars within thy treasury,
<lb/>For to a wise man treasures are but vile.
<lb/>When thou art speaking let thy tongue be shrewd,
<lb/>Make it thy shaft and let thy bow be wisdom.
<lb/>Be not imprudent when a fight is toward,
<lb/>But guard thy body from the enemy,
<pb n="310"/>

<lb/>And when he hath arrayed the host against thee
<lb/>Be prudent and preserve thy self-control.
<lb/>When thou beholdest thine antagonist
<lb/>Thy face must pale not. Thou wilt be victorious
<lb/>If thou art prompt, but slackness will undo thee.
<lb/>Be wary as thou urgest on thy steed,
<lb/>And watch the weapons of thine opposite.
<lb/>If he is eager do not turn away,
<lb/>And choose thee prudent fellow-combatants;
<lb/>But strive not and have sense to quit the fight
<lb/>On finding that thou art no match for him.
<lb/>Thus tender too thy body when thou eatest;
<lb/>Food should not harm thee; eating much will do it,
<lb/>While taking little will increase thy strength.
<lb/>Make not thyself a carfax at thy meals,
<lb/>But always leave off with an appetite.
<lb/>Use wine but use it for refreshment only,
<lb/>For drunkards hear no praise from any one.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1676"/>
<lb/>If thou adore God thou wilt be commended,
<lb/>The world will be a head and thou the eye.
<lb/>Let all thy converse be of the Creator
<lb/>With adoration for the base thereof.
<lb/>Profoundly watch the occasion when to act,
<lb/>And when to take repose by night and day.
<lb/>Select the mean in every enterprise,
<lb/>In making peace as well as waging war.
<lb/>All wind and water blent with dust art thou;
<lb/>Forget not thou the way of holy God.
<lb/>Think more about thy worship than thy meals;
<lb/>Be still a novice though the law is old;
<lb/>Incline to good; acknowledge benefits;
<lb/>Attribute all to Him who made the world;
<lb/>Prefer not lust to wisdom and advice,
<lb/>Or wisdom will regard thee not thenceforth;
<lb/>Go not about to compass wickedness,
<lb/>But being wise adorn thyself with virtues.
<pb n="311"/>

<lb/>He that is good in public and in private
<lb/>Is most to be commended in the world.
<lb/>Teach to thy son the business of the scribe
<lb/>That he may be as life to thee and thine,
<lb/>And as thou wouldest have thy toils bear fruit
<lb/>Grudge not instructors to him, for this art
<lb/>Will bring a youth before the throne and make
<lb/>The undeserving fortune’s favourite.
<lb/>Of all professions ’tis the most esteemed,
<lb/>Exalting even those of lowly birth.
<lb/>A ready scribe who is a man of rede
<lb/>Is bound to sit e’en in the royal presence,
<lb/>And, if he be a man of diligence,
<lb/>Will have uncounted treasure from the Shah,
<lb/>While if endowed with fluency and style
<lb/>He will be studious to improve himself,
<lb/>Use his endeavours to be more concise,
<lb/>And put his matter more attractively.
<lb/>The scribe hath need to be a man of wisdom,
<lb/>Of much endurance and good memory,
<lb/>A man of tact, accustomed to court-ways,
<lb/>A holy man whose tongue is mute for evil,
<lb/>A man of knowledge, patience, truthfulness,
<lb/>A man right trusty, pious, and well-favoured.
<lb/>If thus endowed he cometh to the Shah
<lb/>He cannot choose but sit before the throne.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Whenas the king had listened to these words
<lb/>His heart grew fresh as roses in the spring,
<lb/>And he addressed the high priest thus: <q>Go to,
<lb/>Give Buzurjmihr advancement. Claim for him
<lb/>A robe of honour fitted for his state,
<lb/>And money: he hath made our hearts elate.</q>
</p>


</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><head>The seventh Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and
the Archimages</head>
<p><pb n="312"/>
<lb/>A se’nnight passed, the Sun lit up his crown,
<lb/>And came and sat upon the ivory throne,
<lb/>Together with the high priest, the grandees,
<lb/>The world-aspiring and shrewd-hearted sages,
<lb/>With Sada and with Yazdagird, the scribe,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1677"/>
<lb/>And as their leader the astute Bahman.
<lb/>Then spake the Shah to Buzurjmihr and said:—
<lb/><q>Adorn our hearts and show to us the way.
<lb/>Speak truth about me as thou knowest it,
<lb/>And seek not this world’s honours by deceit.
<lb/>How should men give obedience to my hest,
<lb/>Observe my counsels, and act loyally?
<lb/>Speak at thine ease and speak without reserve:
<lb/>Dress not plain words with colour and with scent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thus Buzurjmihr, the shrewd, said to the Shah:—
<lb/><q>O more exalted than the azure vault!
<lb/>The service of the monarch of the earth
<lb/>Is, saith the sage, the pathway of the Faith.
<lb/>The orders of the Shah brook no delay,
<lb/>Because the Shah’s heart never must be straitened,
<lb/>And every one that is his enemy
<lb/>Is in his soul the liege of Ahriman.
<lb/>The heart that loveth not the monarch’s person
<lb/>Should forfeit brain and skin. Know that the Shah
<lb/>Is the world’s peace, and when thou dost aright
<lb/>He will advance thee. Both for good and ill
<lb/>The power is his, he taketh not revenge,
<lb/>And injureth none. Wish not his son to fill
<lb/>His room but hold his dear face as thy life.
<lb/>Want never findeth entrance to the soil
<lb/>Of states whose monarch is their well-beloved.
<pb n="313"/>

<lb/>His Grace will fend thee from all ill, for why
<lb/>His fortunes nurse all virtue. When a king
<lb/>Hath God’s Grace on his face the world’s heart laugheth
<lb/>For joy. As thou partakest of his favours
<lb/>Strive ever to give ear to his commands.
<lb/>If thou shalt grow disloyal, e’en in thought,
<lb/>That moment fortune will abandon thee.
<lb/>If he associate with thee be not proud,
<lb/>And if he banish thee revile him not.
<lb/>Mark that a subject toiling for his king
<lb/>Will in the toil find treasure and renown.
<lb/>He that shall praise the monarch is of God.
<lb/>And he that is of God will praise the monarch.
<lb/>The liege must neither weary of his work,
<lb/>Nor yet be slack in fight, must keep concealed
<lb/>The counsel of the Shah and tell it not
<lb/>To sun and moon. One that is slack to do
<lb/>The Shah’s commands doth outrage to himself.
<lb/>Accursed are the blossoms of the tree
<lb/>That scattereth naught but leaves o’er crown and throne.
<lb/>Calumniate not his lieges to the Shah,
<lb/>Or thou wilt diminish thine esteem with him:
<lb/>Great liars get small lustre in kings’ eyes.
<lb/>Let no one utter in the royal presence
<lb/>Words that are not conformable with wisdom;
<lb/>But, if the Shah shall ask thee, speak, not losing
<lb/>Thy credit with him by loquacity,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1678"/>
<lb/>Because there is more knowledge in the world
<lb/>Than ears can hear in public and in private.
<lb/>He whom the monarch of the world misprizeth,
<lb/>That soul will be in pain for evermore,
<lb/>While he will be in high esteem on whom
<lb/>The Shah’s lips smile. If he shall show thee favour
<lb/>Hug not thyself, old servant though thou be,
<lb/>For, though thy service may have lasted long,
<pb n="314"/>

<lb/>Know that thou art not indispensable,
<lb/>And if he favoureth another man
<lb/>Tis doubtless one as loyal as thyself.
<lb/>If he shall be displeased with thee in aught
<lb/>Make thine excuses ere thou drawest breath,
<lb/>And if thou wottest naught of thine offence
<lb/>Lay bare thy heart in presence of the Shah,
<lb/>While if thou hast a grievance in thy heart
<lb/>Break it but show not unto him thy face,
<lb/>Lest by God’s Grace he should discern thy secret,
<lb/>Discern thy heart perverse and clouded mind.
<lb/>Thereafter thou wilt get no good of him,
<lb/>Nor hearken to his accents warm with love.
<lb/>Account the Shah’s court as a sea where lieges
<lb/>Are sailors, and accomplishments are vessels
<lb/>With words for anchors and with wits for sails.
<lb/>A wise man, who is voyaging over that sea,
<lb/>Will make his sails robust because they are
<lb/>A source of strength and shelter to himself.
<lb/>The accomplished man, whose wisdom is to seek,
<lb/>Should tread not on the portal of the Shah.
<lb/>Although the Shah should be a mount of fire
<lb/>Still would his servants find existence good,
<lb/>For if such fire burn at the time of wrath
<lb/>It will but shine the more when gratified.
<lb/>The Shah at whiles is milk and honey, whiles
<lb/>A biting bane. His acts are like the sea;
<lb/>The moon is bright in heaven at his behest.
<lb/>One getteth from the sea a pinch of sand,
<lb/>Another hath the pearl within the shell.
<lb/>Be all the world alive in Nushirwan,
<lb/>And circling heaven aye subject to his will,
<lb/>For he doth head the monarchs of the world,
<lb/>And ornament the empire with all good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>To Buzurjmihr’s oration Nushirwan
<lb/>Gave heed, heart-joyed to look on him. The king
<pb n="315"/>

<lb/>Was wont to give his largess on this wise:
<lb/>If he said <q>Good!</q> the largess was four purses,
<lb/>But whensoever he said: <q>Good! very good!</q>
<lb/>The gift amounted in that case to forty,
<lb/>And when the treasurer reckoned with the Shah
<lb/>Each purse was taken at ten thousand drachms.<note>Cf. p. 215, note.</note>
<lb/>The king of kings had said: <q>Good! very good!</q>
<lb/>A speech equivalent to all that coin.
<lb/>The treasurer brought with visage sunny-clear
<lb/>The purses full of drachms to Buzurjmihr.

<div><head>PART III: THE STORY OF MAHBUD AND OTHER MATTERS</head>
<pb n="316"/>


<div><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>The poet tells how Mahbud, sometime chief minister of Nushirwan
and a virtuous and blameless man, was done to death by the
machinations of Zurvan, the chamberlain, and of a Jewish sorcerer,
how too late Nushirwan discovered the plot, put the chamberlain
and the Jew to death, and made all the amends in his power.
The poet then tells how the presents sent by the Khan of Chin
to Nushirwan were plundered on the way by the Haitalians, of
the wars that followed and how Nushirwan married the daughter
of the Khan, Firdausi then discourses of the justice of Nushirwan,
of the happiness and prosperity of the world under his adminis-
tration, and of the tribute paid to him by Caesar and other
potentates. The Part ends with a discourse of Buzurjmihr’s on
good words and good deeds.</p></div>
<div><head>NOTE</head>
<p>§§ 1 and 2, Shah Kubid had left several sons, of whom
Nushirwan was not the eldest, but he was the heir to the throne
by his father’s appointment, who appears also to have made some
arrangement for his recognition as such with the Emperor Justin,
or at all events to have suggested it. On Kubid’s death his eldest
son, Kaus, claimed the throne, but the prime minister Mahbud
(Mebodes) was in a position to indicate what Kubad’s wishes on
the subject had been, and Nushirwan became Shah. Another
brother of his, however, Jam by name, was very popular but
disqualified for the throne by a personal defect. In these circum-
stances a conspiracy was formed to overthrow Nushirwan and
make Jam’s son, Kubid, Shah with Jam himself as regent, Kubid
being still a child. The conspiracy, which had much influential
support, was discovered, and a clean sweep—the usual course in
such cases—made of the conspirators and all their male relations
with the exception of Kubid, who ultimately escaped to Con-

<pb n="317"/>

stantinople and was well received by the Emperor Justinian.
There is no account of the conspiracy in the Shahnama, but it has
been mentioned here because the poisoning incident and the
drastic vengeance that followed may have been transferred from
it to the story of the fall of Mahbud as given in the poem. The
Western account of the fall of Mahbud is entirely different.<note n="1">See NT, p. 147, note; GDF, v. 183; RSM, p. 377 seq.</note></p>

<p>§1. Milk, which <quote>turns</quote> so easily, especially in a hot climate,
would be regarded as more sensitive to evil influences than other
foods. <note n="2">Cf. Burton’s Supplemental Nights, vol iv. p. 248 and note.</note></p>

<p>
§ 2. In view of Nushirwan’s tardy repentance and his reparation
to the kindred of Mahbud it is interesting to find a Mebodes in
high command in the Persian army in A.D. 578.<note n="3">Id. p. 436.</note></p>

<p>§3. The account of the building of Sirsin is a doublet of that
of Zib-i-Khusrau.<note n="4">See p. 259.</note></p>

<p>
§§ 4-11. At this point the Turks come historically upon the
scene under the leadership of their Khan, whom Tabari calls
Sinjibi. In A.D. 569 or 570 they threatened to invade Iran, and
Nushirwan sent his son Hurmuzd against them. As Hurmuzd
was the son of the daughter of the Khan it is evident that the
alliance between Sinjibi and Nushirwan must have been entered
into at a considerably earlier period. The object of the alliance
was to crush the Haitalians, and this was done. Nushirwan
occupied their territory up to the Oxus—the old traditional
boundary of Iran—while the Khan annexed all to the north of
that river, but, according to Persian accounts, withdrew on the
approach of Hurmuzd. Firdausi does not mention Nushirwan’s
wars with the Haitalians, and represents them as being the
aggressors. No doubt they would do their best to prevent friendly
relations between their two formidable neighbours. Later on the
Khan, as Tabari tells us, hearing from the vanquished Haitalians
that Iran had been tributary to them, wished to assert his claim to
a similar payment and marched southwards, as mentioned above,
with that object. He found, however, the frontier of Iran too well
guarded and soon withdrew.<note n="5">NT, p. 159 and notes.</note></p>
<p>§11. For the so-called tribute paid by Rum to Iran see p. 187,
and for the temple of Azargashasp, p. 5.</p>

<p>§13. See p. 278. The formula of Good Thoughts, Good Words,
and Good Deeds plays an important part in Zoroastrianism. One
of the most beautiful passages in the Zandavasta, Yasht XXII,
<note>DZA, ii. 314 seq.</note></p>

<pb n="318"/>

<p>deals with the subject and may be paraphrased briefly and
metrically thus:</p>

<quote>
<l>Once Zoroaster asked, so Text and Comment saith,</l>
<l><quote>How fares the good man’s soul when he has tasted death?</quote></l>
<l>And this was Heaven’s reply: <q/>The soul still sits anigh</l>
<l>Its tenement of clay for thrice a day and night,</l>
<l>And chants the sacred hymns in uttermost delight.</l>
<l>It sings: <q/>Oh! happy he, the man whoe’er he be,</l>
<l>To whom the Great God grants all that he longed to see!<q/></l>
<l>And after that third night, at breaking of the dawn,</l>
<l>Mid lovely plants and scents that good man’s soul is borne,</l>
<l>And from the South will come a perfume-laden air,</l>
<l>The sweetest breath e’er breathed; and then white-armed and fair,</l>
<l>Bright, beautiful, and young, a Maid will meet him there;</l>
<l>Whereat the good man’s soul will question: <q/>Who art thou,</l>
<l>For never have I looked on loveliness till now?<q/></l>
<l>And she will make reply: <q/>Thy Conscience, youth! am I.</l>
<l>Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds, have made me thus to be,</l>
<l>And they were all thine own, and I grew thus through thee.<q/></l>

<p>This matter ended, I proceed to tell
<lb/>The story of Mahbid, the minister.
<lb/>Cease not from learning for a moment’s spell,
<lb/>And let not knowledge cause thy heart to err.
<lb/>When thou shalt say: <q>My lust for wisdom I
<lb/>Have satisfied and learned all needful lore,</q></p>

<p>Fate playeth off some pretty trickery,
<lb/>And putteth thee to discipline once more.
<lb/>Now hearken to a rustic minstrel’s lay,
<lb/><pb n="319"/>
<lb/>Ta’en from the legends of a time long sped ;<note n="1">Seven couplets omitted.</note>
<lb/>I questioned him of ages past away,
<lb/>And this is what of Nushirwan he said :—
<lb/>He had an upright minister, a man
<lb/>Of vigilance, who was his treasurer,
<lb/>Whose heart was full of wisdom and whose rede
<lb/>Was right, whose sole ambition was fair fame.
<lb/>This man so well disposed was named Mahbid :
<lb/>His soul and heart were full of good discourse.
<lb/>He had two sons like jocund spring who served
<lb/>Continually before the king, for he,
<lb/>What time he was about to mutter prayer,
<lb/>Or use the archimages’ sacred twigs,<note n="2">See Vol. i. p. 80 s.v.. Baj and Barsam.</note>
<lb/>Ate only what Mahbid himself provided,
<lb/>And trusted those two sons. He used to have
<lb/>His kitchen in Mahbid’s house and demeaned
<lb/>Himself as guest, and that good, famed man’s sons
<lb/>Themselves brought in the great king’s meal. The nobles
<lb/>Were wont to weep for envy of Mahbid
<lb/>At court. There was a magnate, one Zuran,
<lb/>Whose aspirations all were centred there.
<lb/>He was an old man and Shah’s chamberlain,
<lb/>Conspicuous at feasts and audiences ;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1680"/>
<lb/>His visage ran with tears the whole year through
<lb/>In envy of Mahbid and his two sons.
<lb/>Twas his endeavour to incense the Shah
<lb/>Against the doings of that holy man,
<lb/>Yet failed to find an opening for slander
<lb/>To set the monarch’s mind against Mahbid ;
<lb/>But how should he—that man of wisdom—know
<lb/>That he possessed an enemy at court
<lb/>Since never had he cause to pale one whit
<lb/>For all the words and practice of that knave ?</p>

<pb n="320"/>
<p>A Jew, it happened, borrowed of Zuran
<lb/>One day some money to employ in trade.
<lb/>He came and went, his influence grew, and he
<lb/>Became that gloomy soul’s associate.
<lb/>Thus, as familiar with the chamberlain,
<lb/>He came to be at home about the court,
<lb/>And there one day conversed in confidence
<lb/>Of spells, of court, the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Of magic, necromancy, and black arts,
<lb/>Of crookéd practices and villainy.
<lb/>Zuran, attending to the Jew’s discourse,
<lb/>And hearing of the secrets of his craft,
<lb/>Told his own secret to the Jew, and said :—
<lb/><q>Discourse not of it save with me alone.<note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Thou must perform a deed of sorcery,
<lb/>And give the age its riddance of Mahbid,
<lb/>Because he hath attained to such high state
<lb/>That he will dominate the age itself.
<lb/>He careth not for any. Thou wouldst say,
<lb/>To put it shortly : <q>He is Nushirwan.</q>
<lb/>Now he—the world-lord—will not take of food
<lb/>Save only at the hands of this man’s sons,
<lb/>Who hath become so great through royal favour
<lb/>That heaven kisseth evermore his skirt.</q></p>

<p>The Jew replied : <q> This cause need not increase
<lb/>Thy grief. What time the Shah and world-lord taketh
<lb/>The sacred twigs mark well what meats are served,
<lb/>And see if there be any milk therein.
<lb/>Meet thou the serving-man and sniff the meats ;
<lb/>Twill serve if I but see the milk from far.
<lb/>Then thou shalt see Mahbid and his two sons
<lb/>No more alive. Though he be brass or stone
<lb/>That eateth he will perish instantly.</q></p>

<p>Zuran attended to these words. His heart
<lb/>Was freshened as he gazed upon the Jew ;

<pb n="321"/>
<lb/>Whene’er he went to court the Jew went likewise ;
<lb/>They had their secrets, joys, and feasts in common.
<lb/>A season passed with matters in this stay :
<lb/>The court was haunted by that evil teacher,
<lb/>That court whereto each dawn Mahbid’s two sons
<lb/>Were wont to turn their steps so joyfully.
<lb/>Behind the curtains of their noble father
<lb/>There was a pious dame and well advised,
<lb/>Who, when Shah Nushirwan desired some food,
<lb/>Was wont to spread a golden tray for him,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1683"/>
<lb/>And lay thereon three platters set with jewels ;
<lb/>The whole was covered with a golden napkin,
<lb/>And used to come before the exalted Shah,
<lb/>Served by the two sons of the good Mahbid.
<lb/>The food consisted of rose-water, milk,
<lb/>And honey. Nushirwan would eat and sleep.
<lb/>One day it happened that the two young men
<lb/>Were going with the tray to Nushirwan ;
<lb/>It was conveyed upon a servant’s head
<lb/>To whom 'twas usual to entrust the food.
<lb/>Zuran, the chamberlain, beheld the tray
<lb/>When coming to the palace of the Shah,
<lb/>And with a smile addressed the two youths thus :—
<lb/><q>Ye trusty lieges of Shah Nushirwan !
<lb/>Reveal for once the colour of these meats—
<lb/>The Shah’s repast—because they savour well :
<lb/>Withdraw the silken cover just this once.</q></p>

<p>The young men readily displayed the food.
<lb/>Zuran, who kept his distance, gazed thereon,
<lb/>And in like manner did the Jew, who came,
<lb/>When he had marked the colour of the meats,
<lb/>And said thus to the chamberlain: <q> The tree
<lb/>That thou hast planted cometh into fruit.</q>
<lb/>The two young men, both wise and vigilant,
<lb/>Then carried in the tray to Nushirwan,
<lb/>While after them Zuran came quick as dust,

<pb n="322"/>
<lb/>And thus addressed the Shah, that noble man :—
<lb/><q>O Shah, the just, the favoured by the stars !
<lb/>Touch not these meats till they be tasted first.<note n="4">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The cook hath mingled poison with the milk,
<lb/>And may thine enemies partake thereof.</q>
<lb/>Shah Nushirwan, on hearing, turned his gaze
<lb/>On those two youths whose mother was the cook—
<lb/>A prudent dame affectioned of her kin.
<lb/>They in their innocence and rectitude
<lb/>Rolled up their sleeves. Howbeit when they ate
<lb/>Some of that milk and honey thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q> Both have been stricken by an arrow.</q> Both
<lb/>Swooned on the spot and died there in the presence
<lb/>Of Nushirwan ! The monarch of the world
<lb/>Beheld, his cheeks like flower of fenugreek,
<lb/>And gave commandment: <q> Let them raise in dust
<lb/>The mansion of Mahbid, respecting none,
<lb/>Upon that dust let them cut off his head,
<lb/>And may he and his cook both cease to be.</q></p>

<p>None in the palace of Mahbid, and few
<lb/>Among his kindred in the world, survived.
<lb/>The Shah gave all his goods, his women, children,
<lb/>And hoarded wealth, to spoil. In that affair
<lb/>Zuran attained his wish, since Nushirwan
<milestone unit="calced" n="1682"/>
<lb/>Was quit of that good man, and held the Jew
<lb/>In high esteem who cloudward raised his head.
<lb/>Heaven turned awhile with matters in this stay
<lb/>While from the Shah right hid its face away.</p>

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How the Sorcery of Zuran and the Jew in the Matter of Mahbid
was discovered, and how both were slain by Command of
Nushirwan</head>
<pb n="323"/>
<p>The Shah, the world-lord, purposed, as it chanced,
<lb/>To hunt the wolf and bade that many a steed,
<lb/>Used in the chase, should pass before his eyes,
<lb/>Scanned them, and saw the brand-mark of Mahbid.
<lb/>His cheeks flamed at those Arab horses, love
<lb/>Still had a place within him, and he burned.
<lb/>He wept for pain and with heart sorely seared
<lb/>Recalled to mind Mahbid, and thus he said :—
<lb/><q>How much the wicked Div made to transgress
<lb/>That man of counsel and of high degree !
<lb/>With that devotion and that rectitude
<lb/>Why did his spirit seek the path of loss ?<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The Master of the world alone can tell
<lb/>The hidden truth beneath the outward show.</q></p>

<p>He thence departed to the hunting-ground,
<lb/>Scared at his heart and followed by his men.
<lb/>Upon the route he talked with all and cheered
<lb/>His heart with words. He took full many a minstrel,
<lb/>And with their fascinations docked the way.
<lb/>Now as the Shah’s chief minister and scribes
<lb/>Were journeying with Zuran in company
<lb/>Their converse ran on spells and magic arts,
<lb/>On witchcraft and pernicious Ahriman.
<lb/>The king said to the archmages : <q> Trouble not
<lb/>Your hearts concerning sorcery, but let
<lb/>Your talk be all of God and of the Faith ;
<lb/>Look not for marvels in black arts and magic.</q></p>

<p>Zuran said: <q> Live for ever, and may wisdom
<lb/>Feed on thy words. All that they say of witchcraft
<pb n="324"/>
<lb/>Is true, though this is known but to adepts.
<lb/>If food have milk therein they by a look
<lb/>Can from a distance turn it into bane.</q></p>

<p>On hearing this a bygone time recurred
<lb/>To Nushirwan. He thought upon Mahbid,
<lb/>And those two sons of his, and deeply sighed.
<lb/>He looked upon Zuran but held his peace,
<lb/>And quickly urged his prancing charger on.
<lb/>His mind was in a fume with thought because
<lb/>Zuran had been the foeman of Mahbid.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1683"/>
<lb/>He said : <q>I know not what this miscreant
<lb/>Had done upon the day whereon I slew
<lb/>Mahbid, and that great house was overthrown.
<lb/>Would that almighty God would make all plain,
<lb/>And give my heart and brain tranquillity,
<lb/>Because I spy this fellow’s marks hereon,
<lb/>And am fulfilled with sorrow for the past.</q></p>

<p>He journeyed on with sad and aching heart,
<lb/>With lowering visage and with tearful eyes,
<lb/>And, having reached the ending of the stage,
<lb/>Set up his camp-enclosure by a stream.
<lb/>Now when Zuran had reached the tent they cleared
<lb/>The place of strangers and the converse ran
<lb/>Upon the means of witching milk and honey.
<lb/><q>It is my favourite subject,</q> said Zuran.
<lb/>The Shah then questioned him about Mahbid,
<lb/>And by what means his sons were done to death,
<lb/>And heard the quaver in Zuran’s reply.
<lb/>His crime became apparent. Nushirwan
<lb/>Addressed him, saying: <q> Tell to me the truth,
<lb/>Conceal it not and act not knavishly,
<lb/>For knavery but causeth evil deeds,
<lb/>And evil comrades will corrupt good hearts.</q></p>

<p>Zuran told all the truth, revealed the secret,
<lb/>Threw all the blame upon the Jew, and made
<lb/>As though he were possessed by grief and anguish.
<pb n="325"/>
<lb/>The great king, having listened, fettered him,
<lb/>And sent to that enchanter of a Jew,
<lb/>As swift as smoke, a rider with two steeds.
<lb/>Whenas the Jew had reached the lofty court
<lb/>The exalted monarch questioned him with mildness,
<lb/>And said: <q>Inform me how the matter went,
<lb/>And lie not to me touching this affair.</q></p>

<p>The Jew asked for protection from the world-lord
<lb/>If he revealed the mystery of black art,
<lb/>And then told what Zuran had said with all
<lb/>The matter of their secret conference.
<lb/>The world-lord heard with wonder and convoked
<lb/>The marchlords, potentates, and archimages,
<lb/>And in their presence for the second time
<lb/>Investigated every circumstance.
<lb/>The evil-minded Jew told everything
<lb/>Till naught was hidden from the chiefs. The Shah
<lb/>Then bade the deathsman rear two lofty gibbets,
<lb/>From each whereof a twisted lasso hung,
<lb/>Before the palace-portal in the presence
<lb/>Of all the host. The executioner
<lb/>Haled to the gibbets and suspended there
<lb/>Zuran on one, the Jew upon the other,
<lb/>In savage wise. 'Neath showers of stones and arrows
<lb/>They gave their heads up for bewitching milk,
<lb/>Tread not the world for evil, for it will,
<lb/>Past doubt, befall the practiser of ill.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1684"/>
<lb/>The Shah long sought for kindred of Mahbid,
<lb/>If so he might find one that had escaped,
<lb/>And found one damsel of unsullied name,
<lb/>And three men eminent and excellent.
<lb/>To these he gave all that Zuran possessed,
<lb/>As well as all the fortune of the Jew.
<lb/>His soul kept burning on Mahbid’s account,
<lb/>And in the night he wept till it was day,
<lb/>Would pray to God for pardon and pour forth
<pb n="326"/>
<lb/>His heart’s blood on his bosom. He bestowed
<lb/>Much largess on the mendicants and made
<lb/>His tongue moreover prayerful unto God
<lb/>That He might pardon what was done amiss,
<lb/>And call him not tyrannic and unjust.
<lb/>The worshipper of God, the pure of heart,
<lb/>Will in no evil doings bear a part,
<lb/>For though ill actions are not hard to do,
<lb/>Yet in the end the heart is sure to rue.
<lb/>Although thy heart shall be a flinty stone,
<lb/>Yet in the end its secret will be known,
<lb/>And low soever as thy voice may be
<lb/>Time also will reveal the mystery,
<lb/>While, even if the world shall not regard,
<lb/>Good done in secret is its own reward.
<lb/>If thou art innocent and pure of rede
<lb/>A portion in both worlds will be thy meed.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><head>In Praise of the Wisdom of Nushirwan, and how he
built the City of Sursan</head>
<p>The matter of Zuran and of the Jew
<lb/>Is done, to wisdom now thy praise is due.
<lb/>Just though thou art here is no tarrying ;
<lb/>Thy fame will be thy memory, O king !
<lb/>The unjust sovereign, when all is done,
<lb/>Will have but sepulchre and malison,
<lb/>But if in heart thou dealest righteously
<lb/>Know that the world hath gained new grace by thee ;
<lb/>So if, O chief! thou wilt have praise in death
<lb/>Let wisdom be thy leaf that flourisheth.
<lb/>Thus, through my words, though Nushirwan is dead,
<lb/>His justice hath achieved fresh lustihead.
<pb n="327"/>
<lb/>As soon as all the world acknowledged him
<lb/>He used his greatness only to win praise,
<lb/>Both great and small reposed in peace while wolf
<lb/>And sheep were watered at one fount. The mighty
<lb/>Did service to him and were fain to have
<lb/>His name upon their diadems, the neck
<lb/>Had respite from the clasp of habergeon,
<lb/>The warriors loosed their coats of mail, the shoulder
<lb/>Had ease from sparth and sword, and naught was heard
<lb/>But sounds of mirth. None strove against the world-lord,
<lb/>The tribute and the taxes everywhere
<milestone unit="calced" n="1685"/>
<lb/>Were paid. He took toil easily and loved 
<lb/>The gear of chase and riding-ground. He sat
<lb/>Within his palace arabesqued with gold,
<lb/>And uttered counsel even in his cups.
<lb/>He built a city on the road to Rum
<lb/>About two leagues in length. Within were mansions,
<lb/>And halls and gardens, on one hand a river
<lb/>And, on the other, heights. He built himself
<lb/>A palace in the city with a hall
<lb/>Of audience arabesqued with gold; the vaulting
<lb/>Was all in gold and silver, with the gold
<lb/>Inlaid with divers kinds of precious stones.
<lb/>He built a cupola of ebony
<lb/>And ivory with figures of the same
<lb/>And teak. Artificers from Rum and Hind,
<lb/>Whoever was a master in his craft,
<lb/>And had inherited his master’s skill,<note n="1">Perhaps <quote>Or had been recommended by his master.</quote></note>
<lb/>With all the illustrious artists of Iran,
<lb/>As well as from the province of Nimruz,
<lb/>He gathered in that city, for it was
<lb/>At once a great seat and a place of trade.
<lb/>The prisoners of war brought from Barbar,
<lb/>From Rum, and from the parts laid desolate,
<pb n="328"/>
<lb/>He furnished with a dwelling-house apiece,
<lb/>And made the city one of aliens.
<lb/>The Shah, the glory of the provinces,
<lb/>Made of that city an attractive spot,
<lb/>And, when complete, encircled it with hamlets.
<lb/>The Shah provided tracts of arable ;
<lb/>The soil was fruitful and the trees bore well.
<lb/>He settled there the hostages from Lich,
<lb/>Gilan, and other ravaged provinces,
<lb/>Assigning occupation to each man,
<lb/>And gave to each a helper if alone.
<lb/>He furnished artisans, field-labourers,
<lb/>And men to measure and survey the land,
<lb/>Along with traders and with devotees,
<lb/>With men of station and with underlings.
<lb/>He decked that city as 'twere Paradise ;
<lb/>The eye marked no unseemly spot therein.
<lb/>He called the city by the name Sursan,
<lb/>For world-lords take delight in festivals.<note n="2">Sur, a feast.</note>
<lb/>His only aim in public and in private
<lb/>Was justice and the improvement of the world.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>The Story of the War of the Khan with Ghatkar, the Prince of
the Haitalians, the defeat of Ghatkar, and how they set
Faghanish upon the Throne</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1686"/>
<p>Hear how the Khan and the Haitalians fought,
<lb/>And since a fight is toward take thy mace.</p>

<pb n="329"/>
<p>Thus said the rustic bard, that noble one ;
<lb/>Keep thou in mind what thou shalt hear from him :—
<lb/>Of all the chiefs possessed of Grace and justice,
<lb/>Of men of war, of treasure, and high birth,
<lb/>Omitting Nushirwan, there was not one
<lb/>To match the Khan of Chin in all the world.
<lb/>All people from that realm to the Jihun
<lb/>Paid homage to him as their sovereign.
<lb/>That chief with troops, with treasure, and with crown,
<lb/>Was camped on the Gulzaryin upon
<lb/>The further side of Chach. Reports had spread,
<lb/>Among the great men and throughout the world,
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, his manhood, knowledge, Grace,
<lb/>His greatness and imperial usages.
<lb/>Then was it that the Khan, that prudent man,
<lb/>Desired to win the friendship of the king.
<lb/>He sat awhile with his own counsellors,
<lb/>And all the men of name were gathered there.
<lb/>In his desire for amity he sought
<lb/>The counsel of the nobles and the priests,
<lb/>Got ready presents that exceeded count—
<lb/>All keepsakes worthy of a king’s acceptance—
<lb/>Of Raman chargers and brocade of Chin,
<lb/>Of thrones and crowns and swords and signet-rings ;
<lb/>He got him ready five-score camel-loads
<lb/>Of sundry trinkets that the land produced,
<lb/>And bade his treasurer provide as largess
<lb/>A hundred thousand of dinars of Chin.

<lb/>He also brought and added to the present
<lb/>Ten camel-loads of drachms out of his treasures.
<lb/>He then chose out a man of eloquence
<lb/>Among his chiefs—a wise and travelled man—
<lb/>And called a scribe before him with command
<lb/>To write a letter from the Khan of Chin
<lb/>On silk, as was the custom of the country,
<lb/>Profuse in courteous greetings to the Shah.</p>

<pb n="330"/>
<p>The envoy’s way lay through the Haitalians’ land—
<lb/>A route beset by shaft and battleax—
<lb/>Before whose ruler stood a host whose lines
<lb/>From Sughd extended down to the Jihun.
<lb/>That people’s ruler hight Ghatkar the brave—
<lb/>The most distinguished of their warriors—
<lb/>Who when he heard of what the Khan had done,
<lb/>And of his presents to the Iranian king,
<lb/>Called from the host his veterans, discoursed
<lb/>To them at large about the case, and said :—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1687"/>
<lb/><q>Ill hath befallen us from the stars. If now
<lb/>The monarch of Iran and Khan of Chin
<lb/>Negotiate and thus become good friends,
<lb/>That friendship will hold menace for ourselves,
<lb/>And this our state be wasted on two sides.
<lb/>We needs must make a foray and deprive
<lb/>The envoy of his life.</q></p>
<p>
<lb/>He chose among
<lb/>The troops a man of name, of rank, and prowess,
<lb/>Such as befitted, gave up all that wealth,
<lb/>The camels and the steeds caparisoned,
<lb/>To plunder and cut off the envoy’s head.
<lb/>One horseman of those warriors of Chin
<lb/>Escaped. Now when the tidings reached the Khan
<lb/>His heart was filled with grief, his head with vengeance.
<lb/>He marched an army from Kachar Bashi ;
<lb/>No chief was left in Chin or in Khotan.
<lb/>He let no scion of Afrasiyab,
<lb/>Or of Arjasp, partake of rest and sleep.
<lb/>They all marched forth to the Gulzaryin
<lb/>With full hearts and with heads set on revenge.
<lb/>The captain of the army of the Khan
<lb/>Of Chin was Funj, who made dust reek to heaven.
<lb/>At Chach the fury of the horsemen flushed
<lb/>The waters of Gulzaryin rose-red.
<lb/>Ghatkar heard of the doings of the Khan,

<pb n="331"/>
<lb/>And chose an army from the Haitalians,
<lb/>An army that obscured the sun, and called
<lb/>For treasure, money, troops, and arms from Balkh,
<lb/>Shaknan, Amwi, the Zam, Khatlan, Tirmid,
<lb/>And Wisagird ; he gathered troops from all sides ;
<lb/>From mount and waste, from sands and places bare,
<lb/>They seethed like ants and locusts. When the Khan
<lb/>Had passed the mighty river with his host,
<lb/>With drums and lusty elephants, he massed
<lb/>His powers round Mai and Margh ; the sun became
<lb/>As dusky as a falcon’s plumes<note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note> Bukhara
<lb/>Was all fulfilled with mace and ax, for there
<lb/>The ruler of the Haitalians was encamped.
<lb/>Ghatkar had come forth with a mighty host,
<lb/>And gathered all the native chiefs. The troops
<lb/>Advanced from every quarter to the war,
<lb/>And left the wind no way. What with the flashing
<lb/>Of chieftains’ swords and play of massive maces,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said : <q> Now iron hath a tongue,
<lb/>And air a mace for its interpreter ! </q>
<lb/>A wind arose, rose too the army’s dust,
<lb/>And light departed from the sun and moon.
<lb/>Men of Kashan and Sughd were gathered there.
<lb/>Tears filled the eyes of all—men, women, children—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1688"/>
<lb/>As to the issue of that battlefield,
<lb/>And whom the circling sun and moon would favour.
<lb/>For one whole week those battle-loving hosts
<lb/>Were opposites. On all sides lay the slain -
<lb/>In heaps, and dust and stones were cercis-like
<lb/>With blood. So thick were spear, mace, sparth, and sword
<lb/>That thou hadst said: <q>The clouds are raining stones !</q>
<lb/>The sun evanished in the reek ; dust filled
<lb/>The eyes of eagles as they flew. It veered,

<pb n="332"/>
<lb/>Upon the eighth day, ’gainst Ghatkar, the world
<lb/>Was all bedarkened like night azure-dim,
<lb/>The Haitalians were o’erthrown, irreparably
<lb/>For years, the wounded scattered everywhere,
<lb/>And all the march was full of slain and captives.
<lb/>The living from their hearts invoked God’s name,
<lb/>And said to one another: <q> Ne’er have we
<lb/>Seen such a stubborn fight. Good sooth! yon host
<lb/>Is not of men; ’tis ill to look on them ;
<lb/>They have the faces of wild beasts and divs,
<lb/>And heed not right and wrong. Thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>They know not what it is to flee away
<lb/>From scimitar and spear, from mace and sword.</q>
<lb/>They all have dragon-faces and could pierce
<lb/>A mountain with their spears, they all have claws
<lb/>Like pards and hearts insatiate of war
<lb/>And strife, ne’er take the saddle off their steeds,
<lb/>And think a battle naught. Their chargers batten
<lb/>On thorns, their riders sleep not but are watchful ;
<lb/>They pass the nights in foray and attack,
<lb/>And hazarding their persons in the flames.
<lb/>They know not food or sleep. Would that the Div
<lb/>Would challenge them to fight ! We cannot strive
<lb/>Against the Khan, and we must seek Iran.
<lb/>If now Ghatkar will carry out our wishes
<lb/>He will submit to Nushirwan, surrender
<lb/>The Haitalians’ land to him, and think no more
<lb/>Of mace and sparth ; but if not we will choose
<lb/>Some bold chief of the race of Khtshnawaz,
<lb/>Some man acceptable to Nushirwan,
<lb/>One that can make our state renew its youth,
<lb/>To tell the Khan’s proceedings to the Shah.
<lb/>The whole world praiseth Nushirwan, for he
<lb/>Hath Grace, high bearing, destiny, and wisdom, 
<lb/>And wisdom is the cherisher of right.

<pb n="333"/>
He hath made Caesar tributary. None
<lb/>Can strive with Nushirwan.</q>
<lb/>The Haitalians—
<lb/>Men, women, children—were at one herein.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1689"/>
<lb/>There was a high-born warrior of Chaghan,
<lb/>Aspiring, youthful, fortunate, and just—
<lb/>A man of wisdom, Faghanish by name,
<lb/>Possessing troops and treasures of his own :
<lb/>The chiefs and warriors<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> called him to the throne.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><head>How Nushirwan had Tidings of the Battle of the Khan with

<p>Thereafter to the great king tidings came
<lb/>About the Khan, who was a valiant chief,
<lb/>The Haitalians and the warriors of that folk,
<lb/>And how he had o’erthrown them in the fight ;
<lb/>Moreover of the monarch of Chaghan,
<lb/>Just seated by new fortune on the throne,
<lb/>How he had taken that imperial seat,
<lb/>And, while the brave and glorious warriors
<lb/>Stood, one and all, before his throne, was ever
<lb/>Engaged in consultation with his magnates.
<lb/>The monarch of the world sat full of care
<lb/>At these his wary emissaries’ words,
<lb/>Then in his palace had a hall prepared
<lb/>For session, and the warrior-lieges came
<lb/>With the high priest Ardshir, with Yazdagird,
<lb/>The scribe, and with Shapir. These counsellors,
<lb/>And sages, all held session at the throne
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, who said : <q>Ye archimages
<lb/>Experienced and ye ministers of state !
<lb/>I have discomfortable news—accounts

<pb n="334"/>
<lb/>At once unpleasant and injurious—
<lb/>About the Haitalians and what the Khan
<lb/>Of Chin and marchlords of Turan have done.
<lb/>Troops gathered past all count from Chach, from Chin,
<lb/>Khutan and Turkistan. They bore their helms
<lb/>And vengeful scimitars for one whole week,
<lb/>And never once unsaddled. In the end
<lb/>The Haitalians were discomfited and most
<lb/>Were slain or wounded. With renown like theirs—
<lb/>A folk whose world is mace and partisan—
<lb/>Tis wonderful that they were worsted thus :
<lb/>Defend me from a foolish general !
<lb/>Had but Ghatkar had prudence and good sense
<lb/>The sky itself had routed not his host.
<lb/>The Haitalians, since their land is thus distraught,
<lb/>Have sought a man descended from Bahram Gur,
<lb/>Have placed him on the throne as their new king,
<lb/>And done obeisance to him, one and all.
<lb/>The Khan is posted on this side of Chach
<lb/>In all his pride with treasure, host, and crown ;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1690"/>
<lb/>He is descended from Afrasiyab
<lb/>And from Arjasp, and dreameth of Iran.
<lb/>His triumph o’er the army of Ghatkar
<lb/>Exalteth him in head above the sun.
<lb/>It is not well for us that we should be
<lb/>At one in such a story with the Khan.
<lb/>Kashan, the land wherefrom this folk of Chin
<lb/>Derive their strength, pertaineth to our realm.
<lb/>Our subjects are oppressed by them and yield
<lb/>To them their persons, boundaries, and treasure ;
<lb/>What are your views herein, and how shall we
<lb/>Deal with the Turkmans and the Khan of Chin ?</q></p>

<p>The prudent magnates rose and made reply,
<lb/>First praised the Shah, and said : <q>O fortunate
<lb/>And prescient Shah! all the Haitalian march
<lb/>Is very Ahriman, the folk thereof
<pb n="335"/>
<lb/>Are double-faced and hostile to our coast.
<lb/>They merit any ill that they may get,
<lb/>Although the Shah is right to speak them fairly.
<lb/>Had we no grievance, nothing to avenge
<lb/>In their case save the blood of Shah Piraz,
<lb/>That noble man whom suddenly they slew,
<lb/>And such a king—the lustre of the world !
<lb/>May they joy not one day, for right from wrong
<lb/>Resulteth never. Such is God’s requital :
<lb/>Ill cometh on the heads of all ill-doers.
<lb/>Now if the Shah referreth to the Khan
<lb/>As one vindictive with an ancient grudge,
<lb/>It may be that he hath ill counsellors—
<lb/>Some tearful scions of Afrasiyab.
<lb/>Success too may have heartened him: no marvel
<lb/>If thou dost fear him. As for the Haitalians,
<lb/>And for Ghatkar’s host, neither think nor trouble
<lb/>Concerning them, but let thy shrewd mind turn
<lb/>To what the kindred of Afrasiyab
<lb/>And of Arjasp, and what the Khan, who now
<lb/>Is established on our bank, are doing. Thou art
<lb/>The world’s exalted king, both soul and wisdom
<lb/>Derive their light from thee, and he is blest
<lb/>Whom wisdom nourisheth. Thou art more wise
<lb/>Than this great concourse and thou hast no need
<lb/>Of sage or counsellor. The crown and throne
<lb/>Become thee best of all the world, for thou
<lb/>Hast Grace divine and might, thou fortunate!
<lb/>Still if the Shah shall go to Khurasan
<lb/>He will have cause to tremble for his realm.
<lb/>Hosts ever and anon will come from Rum,
<lb/>On seeing that our land is left unkinged,
<lb/>Exact revenge upon the Iranians,
<lb/>And leave not to Iran or field or fell.
<lb/>None yet hath set his foot upon our land,
<lb/>Or meditated evil on this realm,

<pb n="336"/>
<lb/>Yet if the Shah show fight the crocodiles
<lb/>Will stir not in the streams for fear of him.</q></p>

<p>On hearing what they said of peace and war
<lb/>That master of the world recognized full well
<lb/>The feeling that those sages had at heart—
<lb/>That none of them had any wish for war,
<lb/>Preferring rather feasts and pleasuring—
<lb/>And answered: <q>God be praised, whom I revere
<lb/>In both worlds, that Iran through quiet, sleep,
<lb/>And feasting, hath forgotten how to fight!
<lb/>Preferring peaceful times and banquet-hall
<lb/>Ye have become indifferent to war;
<lb/>Yet ease should follow toil, the body’s travail
<lb/>Hath treasure for its fruit; so in God’s strength
<lb/>Will we at this month’s end prepare to march.
<lb/>I will lead forth a host to Khurasan,
<lb/>Will summon troops from all the provinces—
<lb/>The men of name and warriors—and bind
<lb/>The drums upon the lusty elephants.
<lb/>I will not leave Haitalian or Khan
<lb/>To call down blessings on Iranian soil,
<lb/>But I will weed the world of all the wicked,
<lb/>And by my largess and mine equity
<lb/>Regenerate the realm.</q></p>

<p>The nobles marvelled,
<lb/>Applauded him, excused themselves, and said:—
<lb/><q>Triumphant Shah, endowed with Grace and justice!
<lb/>Oh! may this age rejoice in thy commands.
<lb/>We chiefs are all thy thralls and bow our heads
<lb/>To thy behest and counsel. When the king
<lb/>Shall bid us fight he will not find us wanting.</q></p>

<p>So when the Shah sat with his counsellors
<lb/>The conclave held debate a while thereon.
<lb/>Thus was it till the new moon rose and sat
<lb/>On its new throne. They saw the moon withal
<lb/>Upon the Shah’s own face, and acclamations
<pb n="337"/>
<lb/>Rose from his court. Whenas the shining Lamp
<lb/>O’ertopped the mountains, and the earth resembled
<lb/>A golden saddle-cover, thou hadst said:—
<lb/><q>They have set a topaz cup upon a robe
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli.</q> A shout and blare
<lb/>Of trump arose. They bound the kettledrums
<lb/>Upon the elephants, the soldiers trooped
<lb/>To camp, and with them went the tymbal-players.
<lb/>Then Yazdagird, the scribe, came to the court
<lb/>With counselling archmages and Ardshir.
<lb/>They wrote a letter unto every province,
<lb/>To every man of name and every chief:—
<lb/><q>The Shah hath marched forth with the host to war,
<lb/>So out of loyalty forgo your feastings.</q>
<lb/>The Shah bade send a letter to the Khan,
<lb/>He offered greetings too to Faghanish,
<lb/>And marched an army forth from Madain
<lb/>That covered all the world except the sea;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1692"/>
<lb/>Earth was all troops from mountain unto mountain,
<lb/>And at their centre was the world-lord’s flag.
<lb/>The monarch led forth to Gurgan a host
<lb/>That hid the sun. He rested for a space
<lb/>O’er mount and meadow to pursue the chase.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><head>How the Khan had Tidings of the Coming of the Host of
Nushirwan to Gurgan and wrote a Letter in the Cause of
Peace</head>
<p>The Shah took counsel with his troops what while
<lb/>The Khan abode at Sughd, which everywhere
<lb/>Was like a sea with kinsmen of Arjasp
<lb/>And of Afrasiyab. The Khan said: <q>Earth
<lb/>Will not support this host and throne of mine.
<lb/>I will lead hence the army to Iran,

<pb n="338"/>
<lb/>And onward to the cities of the brave,
<lb/>Will bear the very dust away to Chin,
<lb/>And set the heaven warring with the earth.
<lb/>I will allow not any to possess
<lb/>Crown, throne, or kingship, dignity or fortune.</q></p>

<p>Such was the language that he held awhile,
<lb/>Ambitioning the world with troops and fame,
<lb/>Until the tidings came about the Shah,
<lb/>How he had marched forth from Iran in state,
<lb/>Of his victorious fortune and his might,
<lb/>And how his army stretched from sea to sea.
<lb/>The Khan was troubled when he heard the news
<lb/>That stayed his purposed inroad, and he sat
<lb/>In anxious conclave with his counsellors.
<lb/>The great men of the army were assembled,
<lb/>And he addressed his minister: <q>We cannot
<lb/>Afford to blink these tidings. Nushirwan,
<lb/>I hear, hath reached Gurgan and spread the realm
<lb/>With troops. Good sooth, he hath not news of us,
<lb/>Or hath a witless head. Mine army stretcheth
<lb/>From Chin to the Jihun, the world is neath
<lb/>The glory of my crown. I needs must go
<lb/>And face him in the fight. Delay will shroud
<lb/>The lustre of my name. Himself he deemeth
<lb/>The limit and that none is king but he.
<lb/>Now shall he learn of mine own warriorship,
<lb/>For I will face him with the cavaliers
<lb/>Of Chin.</q>
<lb/>A wise man thus addressed the Khan:—
<lb/><q>O monarch of the earth! think not to fight
<lb/>Against the Shah, and give not to the winds
<lb/>Thy realm and host. None of the kings, unless
<lb/>His heart and counsel lour, ambitioneth
<milestone unit="calced" n="1693"/>
<lb/>The Shah’s seat, for none hath his Grace and fortune:
<lb/>The moon in heaven hath not such a mien.
<lb/>He claimeth tribute both from Hind and Rum,
<pb n="339"/>
<lb/>Wherever there is wealth or peopled land.
<lb/>He is the lord of crown, the ornament



<lb/>Of throne, the conquering master of the world,
<lb/>And fortunate.</q></p>

<p>The Khan took fitting order,
<lb/>On hearing this, and asked his shrewd adviser:—
<lb/><q>What aspect hath this matter to the wise?
<lb/>Two points confront us which we may not shun,
<lb/>And cannot readily pass o’er in silence:
<lb/>If war with him is toil and nothing more
<lb/>There is no better course than spending treasure.
<lb/>Dinars cannot be used to purchase raiment,
<lb/>Or food or carpetings when war is toward,
<lb/>But can procure peace, provand, fair attire,
<lb/>And carpetings. Let all afraid of ill
<lb/>Spurn drachms and be at ease.</q></p>

<p>Then from the host
<lb/>He chose ten fluent speakers apt for parle;
<lb/>A learnéd man of Chin too wrote a letter,
<lb/>All compliments, decked like his idol-houses,
<lb/>And to the king's court those ten prudent horsemen
<lb/>Set forth with much to say. Now when men brought
<lb/>The news to Nushirwan he decked the palace
<lb/>Of king of kings, then bade to raise the curtain,
<lb/>And introduce the envoys joyfully.
<lb/>The ten went in before the king, and took
<lb/>With them the letter, offerings, and gifts.
<lb/>The world-lord, when he saw, received them well,
<lb/>Inquired about the Khan and made them sit.
<lb/>They bent their heads before him to the ground,
<lb/>And gave the message of the Khan of Chin.
<lb/>There was a letter written in that tongue
<lb/>On silk, and this the envoy laid before
<lb/>The scribe. When Yazdagird began to read it
<lb/>The company were filled with wonderment
<lb/>Thereat. It first of all invoked the blessing

<pb n="340"/>
<lb/>Of God, the All-just, upon the king of earth,
<lb/>Next manifested forth the eminence,
<lb/>Wealth, army, arms, and greatness of the Khan,
<lb/>And thirdly said: <q>Faghfur of Chin himself
<lb/>Acclaimeth me, unasked bestowed upon me
<lb/>His daughter, and his host is mine to bid.
<lb/>Tis for the presents that I sent the Shah,
<lb/>Which the Haitalians stopped upon the way,
<lb/>That I came forth from Chach to take revenge,
<lb/>To take the crown and treasure from Ghatkar,
<lb/>So came from the Gulzaryin that all
<lb/>The waters of Jihun grew red with blood,
<lb/>For when in Chin news reached us of the Shah,
<lb/>I praised the teller of his victories,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1694"/>
<lb/>His manliness, his wisdom, modesty,
<lb/>And learning, and in secrecy desired
<lb/>All friendship with the monarch of the world.</q></p>

<p>Now when the Shah discovered from the letter
<lb/>The power, the might, and purpose of the Khan,
<lb/>They made a lodging ready for the envoys,
<lb/>Praised and made much of them. Whene’er the board
<lb/>Was spread for feast and revelry the king
<lb/>Invited them, and for a month they shared
<lb/>With him the hall, the banquet, and the chase.
<lb/>One day he held his court upon the plain,
<lb/>The air was darkened with the horsemen’s dust,
<lb/>And all the marchlords with their golden girdles,
<lb/>Men of Balich and Gil with golden bucklers,
<lb/>Attended in a body at that court,
<lb/>Attended to do service to the Shah,
<lb/>And brought three hundred steeds caparisoned
<lb/>With gold, and scimitars with golden scabbards.
<lb/>Swords, double-headed darts, and javelins glittered:
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Gold is compact with iron.</q>
<lb/>Upon one elephant, whose back was all
<lb/>Housed in brocade, they set a turquoise throne,

<pb n="341"/>
<lb/>Nile-blue, and bruit and stir filled earth and air,
<lb/>Enough to deafen even the best of ears.
<lb/>The ambassadors from Barda’, Hind, and Rum,
<lb/>From every sovereign and peopled realm,
<lb/>And from the spear-armed horsemen of the desert,
<lb/>Went in a body to the king who thus
<lb/>Proved to the men of Chin: <q>Mine is the sway,
<lb/>Mine from the sun down to the Fish’s back.</q><note>See Vol. i. p. 71.</note>
<lb/>Air was all stir and dust of horsemen, earth
<lb/>All armature of war. They made mock-battle
<lb/>Upon the plain whereon there sallied forth
<lb/>The warlike cavaliers and wheeled awhile
<lb/>In pride with sparth and arrow, mace and bow.
<lb/>The plain was full of spear and javelin-men,
<lb/>And here were foot, there horse. The envoys, sent
<lb/>From every clime by every chief and ruler,
<lb/>Astonied at his host and equipage,
<lb/>His countenance, his glory, and address,
<lb/>Held talk with one another, saying thus
<lb/>In whispers: <q>This is an exalted Shah!
<lb/>He seeketh honour, showeth horsemanship,
<lb/>Displayeth to the warriors of the host
<lb/>His spear-point, and the skill that he hath shown us
<lb/>We ought to lay to heart that on returning,
<lb/>Each to our king, we may remember it,
<lb/>And say: <q>None, young or old, hath seen one like
<lb/>Shah Nushirwan.</q></q>
<lb/>They told to the world’s king
<lb/>The sayings of the ambassadors in private.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1695"/>
<lb/>He bade his treasurer bring upon the field
<lb/>His battle-gear, had body-armour brought,
<lb/>With helm and mail, and bade undo the buckles.</p>

<pb n="342"/>
<p>The Shah alone had chest and neck to bear
<lb/>The body-armour, mace, and morion.
<lb/>There was no archer in the host like him,
<lb/>And no such warrior among the nobles.
<lb/>Like some fierce elephant he sought the field
<lb/>With ox-head mace in hand and under him
<lb/>A fiery steed; his stature amazed the throng.
<lb/>A shout rose and the blast of clarions,
<lb/>While bells resounded from the elephants’ backs,
<lb/>And drummers with their cymbals led the way;
<lb/>Earth was in travail 'neath the horses’ hoofs.
<lb/>The king of kings, helmed on an armoured steed,
<lb/>Wheeled to the left and right. The ambassadors
<lb/>Applauded him and louted to the ground.
<lb/>The world-lord sought his palace from the plain,
<lb/>And all the chieftains followed in his train.</p>




</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><head>How Nushirwan answered the Letter of the Khan</head>
<p>The Shah then bade a scribe come with Ardshir,
<lb/>The high priest, and the scribe drew up on paper
<lb/>A royal letter in the olden tongue.
<lb/>He bathed his pen’s two cheeks with ambergris,
<lb/>And first gave praises to the Judge of all—
<lb/>The Maker of the sky, height, depth, and love:
<lb/><q>We all are thralls, He is the King of kings,
<lb/>And wisdom beareth witness to His might.
<lb/>No breath can pass, no emmet tread the ground,
<lb/>Unless by His command. Him have I prayed
<lb/>To further, if He will, my benison
<lb/>Upon the Khan. Now, first, for what thou saidest
<lb/>About the Haitalians: <q>They have girt up,
<lb/>As I have told to thee, their loins for ill;
<lb/>They have shed blood unjustly, wantonly,

<pb n="343"/>
<lb/>And have been taken in their proper toils:</q>
<lb/>The evil-doer, though of lion’s strength,
<lb/>Must not be bold with God. Though these men bare
<lb/>Themselves like leopards thou hast conquered them.
<lb/>Again, for what thou said’st about thy treasure,
<lb/>Host, puissance of Faghfur, his throne and crown:
<lb/>The sage is not at one with him that speaketh
<milestone unit="calced" n="1696"/>
<lb/>Of his own greatness. Never hast thou seen
<lb/>The crown and throne of greatness, and the host
<lb/>And march of Chach to thee are wonderful.
<lb/>All greatness is a question of degree:
<lb/>What star is higher than all other stars?
<lb/>Such is the language to be held with one
<lb/>That seeth not treasure, army, march, or travail.
<lb/>The mighty of the world have seen or heard,
<lb/>If they have seen not, me, that I account not
<lb/>The sea of Chin as water, and that mountains
<lb/>Flee from my wrath. Earth is my treasury,
<lb/>My care extendeth over sea and land.
<lb/>Now, in the third place, thou wouldst be my friend,
<lb/>And hast at heart to make with me a league.
<lb/>Since thou art fain to feast I will not fight,
<lb/>For no one e’er preferreth fight to feast,
<lb/>And furthermore a wise man never seeketh
<lb/>To fight against a man of high renown,
<lb/>Still less with one compact of war, no laggard
<lb/>Upon the day of battle, used to strife,
<lb/>In battle-time requiring no instructor,
<lb/>And one that in the fiercest of the mêlée
<lb/>Is as heart-calm as when enthroned and crowned.
<lb/>May He that made the world be thine ally,
<lb/>Thy crown and signet still continue bright.</q>
<lb/>They sealed this with the Shah’s seal, gave new lustre
<lb/>To royal crown and throne, prepared a robe
<lb/>Of honour, as the royal usage is,

<pb n="344"/>
<lb/>And bade the envoys come before the Shah,
<lb/>Who gave them verbal messages withal
<lb/>In further explication of the letter.
<lb/>The envoys well content then left the palace,
<lb/>Set forth with acclamations on their way,
<lb/>And came with tongues all praise before the Khan.
<lb/>That world-experienced one put all folk forth;
<lb/>His minister attended at his throne.
<lb/>The Khan called in the envoys and inquired
<lb/>At large of them concerning Nushirwan,
<lb/>First of his sense, his knowledge, and his counsel,
<lb/>His mien, his conversation, and his stature;
<lb/>And secondly: <q>How many troops hath he,
<lb/>And who of them hath crown and signet-ring?</q></p>

<p>Inquired about his rule, if just or not,
<lb/>About his realm, his treasure, host, and crown.
<lb/>The spokesman of the envoys loosed his tongue,
<lb/>And answered touching all that he had seen.
<lb/>He told the Khan: <q>Account not Nushirwan,
<lb/>O king! as one inferior to thyself.
<lb/>A hundred ages see but few like him
<lb/>For leadership, for statesmanship, and favour.
<lb/>At home, at feast, at war, and at the chase
<lb/>We never looked on such a sovereign.
<lb/>In height he is a cypress-tree, in strength
<lb/>An elephant; his hand is like the Nile

<milestone unit="calced" n="1697"/>
<lb/>For bounty; throned he is a trusty sky,
<lb/>In battle-tide a baleful crocodile.
<lb/>When he is wroth he roareth like a cloud;
<lb/>The mighty lion quaileth at his voice,
<lb/>But gentle is it when he revelleth,
<lb/>And his warm utterances ravish hearts.
<lb/>In state and throne he is the blessed Surush;
<lb/>He is a royal and fruit-bearing Tree.
<lb/>The whole folk of Iran compose his host,
<lb/>And are the adorers of his diadem.

<pb n="345"/>
<lb/>What time he holdeth court upon the plain
<lb/>The world itself containeth not his troops.
<lb/>His mace-men all have golden belts and all
<lb/>His ministers decor and Grace divine.
<lb/>As for the steps up to his ivory seat,
<lb/>His elephants, thrones, armlets, torques, and crowns,
<lb/>No one in all the world can estimate
<lb/>His state except the almighty Judge of all.
<lb/>Although his foeman were an iron mount
<lb/>'Twould be a needle’s eye before his wrath.
<lb/>Let him that is weary of his life
<lb/>Wax fierce and counter Nushirwan in strife!</q></p>


</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><head>How the Khan bethought himself and wrote offering his
Daughter in Marriage to Nushirwan</head>
<p>On hearing this the Khan turned wan and like
<lb/>The flower of fenugreek, his heart grew full
<lb/>Of terror at the words, his brain was rent
<lb/>By his solicitude. He sat in dudgeon
<lb/>With his advisers, and he thus addressed
<lb/>That noble company: <q>Ye men of wisdom!
<lb/>What is our rede herein? Who can be more
<lb/>Concerned and hurt than I by this mischance?
<lb/>He must not conquer in the fight or all
<lb/>Our fame will turn to infamy.</q></p>

<p>The sages
<lb/>Took cognisance of all the affair and spake,
<lb/>Suggesting divers lines of policy.
<lb/>Then said the Khan: <q>Our policy is this—
<lb/>To send a pledge of good faith to the Shah,
<lb/>To take a deeper view and to arrange
<lb/>That he shall be affined to me. I have
<lb/>Full many a daughter in my ladies’ bower—
<lb/>All crowns upon the heads of noble dames—
<pb n="346"/>
<lb/>And I will wed one to the king of kings,
<lb/>And thus cut short my cares in that regard.
<lb/>If we make blood-relationship with him
<lb/>None will advise him to our detriment.
<lb/>On his side it will be a joy and honour,
<lb/>While war with any other is a jest.</q><note>1 Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The chiefs approved the counsel of the king,
<lb/>And cried: <q>That is the course.</q></p>

<p>He chose three men
<lb/>Of rank out of the host, men that could speak,
<lb/>And grasp an answer. He unlocked his hoards
<lb/>Of coin and said: <q>‘Why should we treasure jewels
<lb/>Save to win fame, shun shame, or occupy
<lb/>In largess, feasting, and expedient?</q></p>

<p>He had a gift made ready such as none,
<lb/>Or great or small, e’er had beheld, and calling
<lb/>A well-experienced scribe declared his mind.
<lb/>He first of all gave praises to the Maker,
<lb/>All-wise, all-powerful, and all-sustaining,
<lb/>The Lord of Saturn and of Sun and Moon,
<lb/>The Lord of victory and mastery,
<lb/>Who asketh from his slaves but righteousness,
<lb/>And brooketh not that justice should be balked:—
<lb/><q>His blessing be upon the Iranian king,
<lb/>The Lord of scimitar, of mace, and helm,
<lb/>The Lord of understanding, crown, and throne,
<lb/>And dowered by the God of victory
<lb/>With fortune and content. The king of kings,
<lb/>Of royal race, wise, weighty, learned, and just,
<lb/>Is ware that men, albeit great and noble,
<lb/>Fain would be dear in other men’s regard.
<lb/>Now when my sage ambassadors, the men
<lb/>That are both mine associates and allies,
<lb/>Had come back from thy court to mine and told me
<lb/>At large about the Shah—his justice, wisdom,

<pb n="347"/>
<lb/>Good fortune, crown, pre-eminence, and throne—
<lb/>His Grace divine caused to arise in me
<lb/>A great desire to shadow 'neath his wings.
<lb/>Now naught is dearer than our own heart’s blood,
<lb/>And prudent children and our hearts are one;
<lb/>So let him, if he will, demand of me
<lb/>One of my stainless daughters—her that is
<lb/>Most gentle, fair, discreet—and she in sooth
<lb/>Shall profit him, the marches of Iran
<lb/>And Chin shall meet, our worship be the more.</q></p>

<p>This was all written out on silk of Chin,
<lb/>And carried with the seal to the wazir.
<lb/>The Khan selected from among his kin
<lb/>Three men of noble rank and eloquence,
<lb/>And they departed from the exalted court
<lb/>Iran-ward to the exalted Shah who, when
<lb/>He heard thereof, prepared his crown and sat
<lb/>Upon his royal throne of ivory.
<lb/>So those three men of prudence and high rank
<lb/>Arrived before the exalted throne. They brought
<lb/>Three turbans, of dinars some thirty thousand,
<lb/>And laid them as a gift before the Shah.
<lb/>The gifts of gold and silver, the brocade
<lb/>Of Chin, made earth more brilliant than the sky.
<lb/>Now when the envoys duly had been seated
<lb/>They called down blessings in their native tongue,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1699"/>
<lb/>And then the Shah’s chief minister prepared
<lb/>Fit lodging for them. Heaven revolved one night,
<lb/>And when the bright sun rose above the mountains
<lb/>The Shah sat down upon the turquoise throne,
<lb/>And set a crown of jewels on his head.
<lb/>He ordered that the archmages and the chiefs
<lb/>Should sit in conclave with the famous sages,
<lb/>And said thus: <q>Bring and lay before the scribe
<lb/>The letter writ on silk.</q></p>

<p>The nobles all
<pb n="348"/>
<lb/>Sat round while Yazdagird drew near the Shah,
<lb/>And read the letter which amazed the throng,
<lb/>Such good will, fair excuse, and compliment
<lb/>Were patent in the utterance of the Khan.
<lb/>All those illustrious and prudent chiefs
<lb/>Began to praise the king: <q>Thanks be to God,
<lb/>With whom our refuge is, that He hath set
<lb/>Upon the state a Shah endowed with Grace,
<lb/>With victory, and majesty, a Shah
<lb/>Good, kind, and prudent, one that is in fight
<lb/>A mighty, raging elephant, in feast
<lb/>A gallant host. All foes are underlings
<lb/>Of thine, if they be worthy of that title.
<lb/>We all were fearful of this power from Chach,
<lb/>And of the Khan, who hath both crown and treasure,
<lb/>By the imperial Grace is now our friend,
<lb/>And seeketh with the Shah affinity.
<lb/>One that is wise among the warrior-chiefs
<lb/>Will tender peace and justice. Since the Khan
<lb/>Is ware that he cannot withstand the Shah
<lb/>He seeketh for affinity to him.
<lb/>There should be no delay in this affair,
<lb/>For such affinity disgraceth none.
<lb/>His troops extend from Chin up to Bukhara,
<lb/>And all the chiefs are under his protection.</q></p>

<p>Now when the Shah heard what those sages said—
<lb/>Those magnates and archmages shrewd of heart—
<lb/>They cleared the hall of strangers and then brought
<lb/>The ambassadors in haste before the Shah.
<lb/>The king of kings received them graciously,
<lb/>And set them near the throne. Those chosen men
<lb/>Of Chach beheld the chief in all his pomp
<lb/>Of troops, wealth, crown, and gave their master’s message,
<lb/>Protesting that their words were true. The Shah,
<lb/>When he had heard the fervent words thus uttered

<pb n="349"/>
<lb/>In gentle accents by the chiefs of Chin,
<lb/>Replied: <q>The Khan is great, wise, worshipful,
<lb/>Desireth kinship with us through his child,
<lb/>And illustrateth thus his own good will.
<lb/>The man whom understanding maketh wise
<lb/>Will look upon affairs with wisdom’s eye;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1700"/>
<lb/>We will take order, will advise us well,
<lb/>And make response to all that he hath said
<lb/>On this condition—that the Khan of Chin
<lb/>Shall give our heart the liberty of choice.
<lb/>I will dispatch a wise man who shall look
<lb/>On all his women-folk and shall select
<lb/>The most illustrious and dear to him,
<lb/>See what her own maternal grandsire was,
<lb/>And her own quality of royal birth.
<lb/>When what we name shall have been done the Khan
<lb/>Will have performed his portion of the pact.</q></p>

<p>The envoys called down praises, saying thus:—
<lb/><q>The Khan of Chin rejoiceth in the Shah,
<lb/>And were his ladies’ bower a cloud of jewels
<lb/>He would withhold it not from Nushirwan.
<lb/>Select among the sages one to go
<lb/>Before the Khan whose ladies shall not fail
<lb/>In that one’s sight their faces to unveil.</q></p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><head>How Nushirwan answered the Letter, and sent Mihran Sitad

<p>The king of kings heard what they said; the age,

<lb/>Spoke of the Khan at large, and bade indite
<lb/>An answer couched in choice and gracious terms.</p>

<pb n="350"/>
<p>He first gave praises to almighty God,
<lb/><q>The World-lord, Conqueror, and Nourisher.
<lb/>The world is established by His ordinance;

<lb/>E’er should desist from hope and fear in Him.
<lb/>The worshipful ambassador hath come,
<lb/>And brought a gracious message from the Khan.
<lb/>Heard have I what was said about a league,
<lb/>And of the virtuous daughters of his house:
<lb/>My heart would joy to be allied to him,
<lb/>And in especial through his own chaste child.
<lb/>Lo! I have sent to thee a prudent man,

<lb/>Embellished all the paper, rolled it up,
<lb/>And, when the last tears of the pen were dry,
<lb/>Affixed a seal of musk. The Shah bestowed
<lb/>A robe of honour on the ambassadors,
<lb/>Such as amazed the company, and chose
<lb/>A wise old chief, by name Mihran Sitad,
<lb/>And five score famed Iranian cavaliers,
<lb/>All men renowned, discreet, and eloquent,
<lb/>And said thus to Mihran Sitad: <q>Go forth
<lb/>Glad and triumphant, and with love and justice.
<lb/>Be thine the fluent tongue of chiefs, be wisdom
<lb/>Thy guide, thy heart all lovingkindliness.
<lb/>Scan well the women’s quarters of the Khan,
<lb/>And thoroughly search out all their good and ill.

<pb n="351"/>
<lb/>They must not fool thee with a mere display
<lb/>Of countenance, of grace, and ornament.
<lb/>The Khan hath many daughters stately, tall,
<lb/>And crowned, behind his curtains, and of these
<lb/>The offspring of his slaves are not for me,
<lb/>Although they have a king to father them;
<lb/>Look thou for one that is both meek and good,
<lb/>Whose mother is descended from the Khans.
<lb/>If she hath gifts according to her birth
<lb/>She will rejoice the world and live in joy.</q></p>

<p>Mihran Sitad, when he had heard, invoked
<lb/>Much blessing on the crown and throne, and left
<lb/>The portal of the world-illuming Shah
<lb/>At a propitious season on the day
<lb/>Khurdad. News of his coming reached the Khan,
<lb/>Who sent out troops to welcome him, and when
<lb/>He reached the presence of the Khan he kissed
<lb/>The ground and proffered praise. On seeing him
<lb/>That world-aspiring king received him well,
<lb/>Assigning him an honourable room,
<lb/>But, being much concerned at the affair,
<lb/>Withdrew to the apartments of the queen,
<lb/>Declared to her the words of Nushirwan,
<lb/>Spoke of his treasures and his host, and <q>This
<lb/>Shah Nushirwan,</q> he told her, <q>is still young,
<lb/>And wary, and his fortune is young also.
<lb/>Fain am I to bestow on him a daughter
<lb/>To magnify our worship in his sight.

<pb n="352"/>
<lb/>One such I have, concealed behind the veil—
<lb/>A Crown upon the head of ladyhood,
<lb/>The fairest of the fair throughout the world,
<lb/>And many a chief hath sought her at my hands.
<lb/>I love her so that never would I cease
<lb/>To gaze upon her face. I have four others—
<lb/>The offspring of my slaves, themselves both slaves
<lb/>And handmaids, clever girls—and one of them
<lb/>Will I bestow on him, and rest from warfare,
<lb/>And from dispute.</q>
<lb/>The queen replied to him:—
<lb/><q>None in the world will oust thee, thou’re so wise!</q>
<lb/>In such discourse they passed the night away
<lb/>Until the sun ascended o’er the mountains,
<lb/>And then Mihran Sitad arrived, drew near
<lb/>The throne, and gave the letter. When the Khan
<lb/>Had read he smiled upon the union
<lb/>And goodly choice proposed, gave up the key
<lb/>That oped his ladies’ bower, and said: <q>Go look
<lb/>On what is hidden there.</q></p>

<p>Four trusty slaves
<lb/>Came to accompany Mihran Sitad,
<lb/>Who, when he heard the Khan, went with the key
<lb/>And them withal. He oped the doors. They entered,
<lb/>The slaves protesting to him: <q>Never star
<lb/>And sun and moon have seen the sight that thou
<lb/>Art on thy way to see!</q>
<lb/>The ladies’ bower
<lb/>Was Paradise adorned—all Suns and Moons
<lb/>And goodly havings—while upon the throne
<lb/>Five fay-faced maidens sat crowned and arrayed
<lb/>In treasures, save the daughter of the queen,
<lb/>Who wore no crown or bracelet, torque or jewel,
<lb/>But only had on her a well-worn robe,
<lb/>And for a crown her musky locks divine.
<lb/>Her cheeks were made not up: she only wore
<lb/>What God had given her—a Cypress she,
<lb/>Surmounted by a new moon that diffused
<lb/>A lustre o’er the new throne where she sat.</p>

<pb n="353"/>
<p>Now when Mihran Sitad came and beheld
<lb/>He saw none like to her, and, being shrewd
<lb/>Of heart and counsel, knew that king and queen
<lb/>Were fooling him. The damsel used her hands
<lb/>As kerchief for her eyes. Mihran Sitad
<lb/>Grew wroth anew and told the slaves: <q>The Shah
<lb/>Hath many a bracelet, crown, and throne, and I
<lb/>Choose her that lacketh crown and ornament,
<lb/>For these will make her still more beautiful.
<lb/>I came to show discretion in my choice;
<lb/>I came not to procure brocade of Chin.</q></p>

<p>The queen replied: <q>Old man! thou speakest not
<lb/>One gracious word and art not well advised
<lb/>If thou preferrest such a child as this
<lb/>To these princesses who are gracious, fair,
<lb/>And wise, have reached a marriageable age,
<lb/>And kindle hearts—girls tall as cypress-trees,
<lb/>With cheeks like spring and very well aware
<lb/>Of all the worship that is due to kings.</q></p>

<p>Mihran Sitad said: <q>If the Khan shall act
<lb/>Unfairly in this matter let him know
<lb/>That Nushirwan, the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Will term me an old knave. The one that sitteth,
<lb/>All unadorned by bracelet, torque, and crown,
<lb/>Upon the ivory throne best pleaseth me;
<milestone unit="calced" n="1703"/>
<lb/>But, if your Highnesses will not consent,
<lb/>With your permission I will go my ways.</q></p>

<p>The queen observed his words. His policy
<lb/>And conduct made her muse. The crafty envoy
<lb/>Then left her, went back to the Khan, and told
<lb/>All that had passed. The Khan saw him perturbed,
<lb/>And knew: <q>This shrewd old man is great and apt
<lb/>For delicate affairs.</q>
<lb/>The prudent king
<lb/>Sat with his counsellors, put forth the throng,
<lb/>And, when the place for conclave had been cleared,
<lb/>The readers of the stars who bore in hand
<lb/>Their Roman astrolabes, the mighty men,
<lb/>And all the chiefs, attended. Then the Khan
<lb/>Commanded every loyal liege to mark
<lb/>The aspect of the sky. The sages scanned
<lb/>The stars to find out how the Khan should act,
<lb/>And as to his alliance with the Shah,
<lb/>And at the last said thus: <q>Let not, O king!
<lb/>Thy heart be vexed by evil any whit,
<lb/>Because this matter can but end in good,
<lb/>And time will count thy foemen’s counsels ill.
<lb/>This is the purpose of high heaven herein—
<lb/>The horoscope and prosperous event—
<lb/>That from the daughter of the Khan and from
<lb/>The Shah’s loins a throne-gracing prince will come;
<lb/>The country of Iran, the men of name
<lb/>And worth in Chin, his praises shall proclaim.</q></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><head>How the Khan sent his Daughter, escorted by Mihran,
with a Letter and Treasures to Nushirwan</head>
<p>The Khan, on hearing this, was glad of heart,
<lb/>Smiled too the sunlike queen. When they had purged
<lb/>Their hearts of artifice they set the envoy
<lb/>Before them and told all that he should know
<lb/>About the queen’s child kept secluded thus,
<lb/>Whom from her sire Mihran Sitad received
<lb/>On the victorious king of kings’ behalf.
<lb/>The deputy received, the Khan bestowed,
<lb/>The only daughter that the queen had borne.
<lb/>The handmaids came with gifts, came joyfully
<lb/>Before the king, and afterwards a treasure,
<lb/>Comprising goods of all sorts, was prepared—
<lb/>Dinars, gems, torques, and crowns, a turquoise litter,

<pb n="355"/>
<lb/>An ivory throne, and one of aloe-wood
<lb/>From Hind, with gold and divers jewelry
<milestone unit="calced" n="1704"/>
<lb/>Inlaid, and with each throne a royal crown;  
<lb/>A hundred horses and a hundred camels,
<lb/>The horses saddled and the camels bearing
<lb/>Brocade of Chin, and forty tapestries
<lb/>Of cloth of gold enriched with emeralds.
<lb/>Of carpets too he laid a hundred loads
<lb/>On camels, and brought forth three hundred handmaids,
<lb/>And saw that all were mounted for the journey,
<lb/>Each with a flag in hand—the use in Chin.
<lb/>The Khan, victorious of fortune, bade
<lb/>To set up on an elephant a throne
<lb/>Embossed with gold and silver all incrusted
<lb/>With gems unworn, and rear a flaunting flag
<lb/>That made the ground all viewless with brocade.
<lb/>It took a hundred men to carry forth,
<lb/>And raise, that standard skyward from the plain.
<lb/>A litter tricked out with brocade and gold
<lb/>Contained the maiden Gem. Three hundred handmaids,
<lb/>All blithe of heart and bright of countenance,
<lb/>Accompanied that moon-faced one. He sent
<lb/>His daughter to the Shah with troops for escort,
<lb/>And forty eunuchs to precede the slaves,
<lb/>And march before her with rejoicing hearts.
<lb/>The preparations over, came the scribe,
<lb/>And brought with him rose-water, musk, and silk.
<lb/>The Khan then wrote a letter like the Artang,
<note>Arzhang, another form of the same word, in the original. For Artang, see Vol. ii. p. 19 and note.</note>
<lb/>All illustration, colour, scent, and beauty,
<lb/>And first of all gave praises to the Maker,
<lb/>Lord of the world, all-watchful and all-seeing:—
<lb/><q>He fashioned all things by divine decree
<lb/>To guide His servants to predestined ends.

<pb n="356"/>
<lb/>My crown is the Iranian king of kings.
<lb/>Not for my daughter’s sake have I desired
<lb/>A league with him, but hearing from the wise,
<lb/>The great men and the wary-hearted priests,
<lb/>About his Grace, his majesty, and throne,
<lb/>I sought for intercourse and league with him
<lb/>Because so just a ruler girdeth not
<lb/>His loins in all the world, or one so great
<lb/>In manhood, victory, and mastery,
<lb/>In Grace, mien, throne, and crown, while holy God
<lb/>Sustaineth him with justice and with knowledge,
<lb/>With Faith and wisdom. Lo! we have dispatched,
<lb/>According to our rites, our very Eye
<lb/>To Nushirwan the Shah, commanding her
<lb/>To serve him as his slave when she shall pass
<lb/>Behind his curtains. From his Grace and insight
<lb/>She will learn wisdom and acquire his ways
<lb/>And usages. May wit and fortune guide thee,
<lb/>Be majesty and knowledge thy supports.</q></p>

<p>They set the seal upon that musk of Chin,
<lb/>And gave the letter to the ambassador
<milestone unit="calced" n="1705"/>
<lb/>With compliments. The Khan prepared for him
<lb/>A robe of honour past all precedent
<lb/>As given by the great ones of the world
<lb/>In public or in private to an envoy.
<lb/>The Khan gave presents also to the suite,
<lb/>And made them happy with dinars and musk.
<lb/>He travelled with his daughter and the goods,
<lb/>The beasts and elephants caparisoned,
<lb/>Until he reached the bank of the Jihun,
<lb/>And poured his heart’s blood from his eyes the while;
<lb/>He thence betook him homeward with full heart
<lb/>And, in his daughter’s stead, had pain for comrade;
<lb/>Howbeit he delayed till they had crossed,
<lb/>And reached dry land upon the further side.</p>

<pb n="357"/>
<p>When tidings came about Mihran Sitad
<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The folk presented gifts and offerings,
<lb/>And all with one consent called blessings down
<lb/>Upon the Shah and on the chief of Chin.
<lb/>With hearts rejoiced with largess and with gifts,
<lb/>And all disposed for hospitality
<lb/>And amity, the folk decked road and city,
<lb/>And showered drachms upon the royal bride.
<lb/>Toward Amwi and Marv’s unwatered ways
<lb/>All earth was like a pheasant’s plumes, and thou
<lb/>Hadst said of all the journey to Bastam,
<lb/>And to Gurgan: <q>The earth saw not the sky
<lb/>For decorations and triumphal arches
<lb/>In waste and town wherethrough the progress lay.</q></p>

<p>Men, women, children, from the palaces,
<lb/>Met where that Idol brought from Chin would pass,
<lb/>Showered on her escort drachms from overhead,
<lb/>And sifted o’er them musk and ambergris.
<lb/>The scents were mixed on salvers, and the world
<lb/>Was full of din from trump and kettledrum.
<lb/>The horses’ manes were drenched with musk and wine,
<lb/>And sweets and drachms were scattered under-foot,
<lb/>While through the din of rebeck, harp, and pipe,
<lb/>There was no room on earth for rest and sleep.
<lb/>Now when the idol reached the royal bower,
<lb/>And Nushirwan had looked within the litter,
<lb/>He saw a Cypress with the orbéd moon
<lb/>Above it and upon the moon a crown
<lb/>Of ambergris. There was another too
<lb/>Of musky coils joined chain-wise, link on link,
<lb/>The links entrammelled, plaited daintily,
<lb/>And curiously entwined like civet ring-work
<lb/>Upon a rose’s petal, while beneath
<lb/>The ring-work shone the planet Jupiter.</p>

<pb n="358"/>
<p>Shah Nushirwan was all astound thereat,
<lb/>And o’er her oft invoked the name of God,
<lb/>Assigned her a fit dwelling for her own,
<lb/>And they made ready for that Moon a throne.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><head>How the Khan withdrew, and how Nushirwan marched
from Gurgan to Taisafin</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1706"/>
<p>When of Iran and of the Iranian king
<lb/>News reached the Khan of Chin, and of the joy
<lb/>Wherewith his child had been received, and how
<lb/>The alliance caused good cheer and happiness,
<lb/>He gave up Sughd and Samarkand and Chach,
<lb/>And sent his crown on to Kachar Bashi.
<lb/>Now when the hosts of Chin had left these states
<lb/>The Shah sent marchlords thither. He renewed
<lb/>The world by equity, and old and young
<lb/>Could sleep upon their backs. All everywhere
<lb/>Called blessings down on him with hands upraised
<lb/>To heaven: <q>O Ruler over space and time!
<lb/>Keep in Shah Nushirwan this justice still,
<lb/>And turn the ills of fortune from his life,
<lb/>For by his Grace divine and majesty
<lb/>Both public ills and private have been banned.
<lb/>What time he reached Gurgan to hunt none saw
<lb/>The Khan’s face smile; the cavaliers of Chin
<lb/>Forwent their food and sleep, and none off-saddled;
<lb/>Three hundred thousand Turkman troops dispersed
<lb/>Instead of striving and of combating;
<lb/>There is no need to string the bow, for none
<lb/>Of Chin, or small or great, remaineth here,
<lb/>Such were the Grace divine and royal mien
<lb/>Wherewith the savage Lion sought the chase;

<pb n="359"/>
<lb/>Such were his reputation and his star
<lb/>That fortune was the comrade of his throne.</q>
<lb/>Then from the regions lying ’twixt Amwi,
<lb/>Chach, and Khutan, the nobles met and said:—
<lb/><q>These spacious regions full of pleasances,
<lb/>Of riding-grounds, of palaces, and halls,
<lb/>From Chach and the Tarak to Samarkand
<lb/>And Sughd are wholly waste—the home of owls.
<lb/>They of Chaghan, Shiknen, Khatlan, and Balkh,
<lb/>Have all experienced dark and bitter days.
<lb/>Great are our pain and sorrow when we name
<lb/>Bukhara and Kharazm, Amwi and Zam.
<lb/>Once none gat rest and sleep, so tyrannous
<lb/>And cruel was Afrasiyab! Howbeit
<lb/>We found deliverance when Kai Khusrau
<lb/>Came, and the world had peace from bickering.
<lb/>Then when Arjasp gained lustihead these marches
<lb/>Were filled with anguish and calamity,
<lb/>But when Gushtasp marched from Iran to battle
<lb/>Arjasp perceived no tarrying-place, and then
<milestone unit="calced" n="1707"/>
<lb/>The world had quiet from his enterprises.
<lb/>May heaven ne’er befriend him! Afterwards,
<lb/>What time Narsi became the chief, these coasts
<lb/>Were full of misery, but when Shapur,
<lb/>Son of Hormizd, usurped, and when Narsi
<lb/>Discerned not hand from foot, the world found justice,
<lb/>And quiet, and the hand of Ahriman
<lb/>Was stayed from evil. When the Khan bore off
<lb/>The world from Yazdagird, and had acquired
<lb/>Dexterity in ill, there came the world-lord,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, to afflict and trouble him,
<lb/>To make the states like Paradise with justice,
<lb/>And scatter the unseemly and the foul.
<lb/>So Khosrow, what time Piruz was Shah,
<lb/>Filled all the world with bloodshed, heat, and anguish,
<lb/>And perish Faghanish that son of his
<lb/>With all his unjust kith and kin! And now
<lb/>The world-lord Nushirwan hath occupied
<lb/>Our marches and hath made us rich indeed!
<lb/>For ever may his policy endure,
<lb/>And may the whole world be at one with him.
<lb/>Now that the earth beholdeth justice we
<lb/>Will contemplate no travail, shed no blood.</q>
<note>The historical reminiscences put into the mouths of dwellers beyond the Oxus and even the Jaxartes are of course valueless.</note>
<lb/>Then from the Haitalians, Turkmans, and Khutan
<lb/>The people met by the Gulzaryin
<lb/>From every quarter where some shrewd priest lived,
<lb/>Or other potentate good, learned, and wise,
<lb/>While all the Turkmans that were well advised
<lb/>Drew to the Shah—a mighty company.
<lb/>It was the policy of all these troops
<lb/>To come before the Shah with offerings,
<lb/>And when they came before him, when they came,
<lb/>All with one heart and tongue, the monarch’s court
<lb/>Was so fulfilled with people that they barred
<lb/>The way to ant and gnat! All louted low,
<lb/>Called praises down upon the Shah, and said:—
<lb/><q>O Shah! we are thy slaves and live to do
<lb/>Thy bidding in the world. We all of us
<lb/>Are nobles dight for war and rend the hides
<lb/>Of leopards on the field.</q></p>

<p>The king of kings
<lb/>Received their gifts, and then they left the presence,
<lb/>Their leader Faghanish. Behind him came
<lb/>A troop of youthful warriors. When thus
<lb/>They had found favour in the monarch’s sight
<lb/>The chamberlain went to the palace-gate
<lb/>With formal greetings and with compliments,
<lb/>And lodged them through the city. Afterwards
<lb/>The king of kings, that worshipper of God,

<pb n="361"/>
<lb/>Passed from the audience-chamber to the dust,
<lb/>And offered up thanksgivings to the Almighty:—
<lb/><q>O Thou above vicissitudes of fortune!
<lb/>Thou gav’st me Grace, accomplishment, and counsel,
<lb/>And art my Guide in all things good and ill,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1708"/>
<lb/>For all that hear of me seek not thereafter
<lb/>The crown of majesty, but all submit
<lb/>To be my lieges. None hath pluck to fight.
<lb/>Birds on the mountains, fishes in the water,
<lb/>Remain awake to watch what time I slumber;
<lb/>All the wild creatures are my sentinels,
<lb/>The mighty of the world mine underlings;
<lb/>No abject he whom Thou dost choose who art
<lb/>The world’s sole Lord and giv’st me strength therein
<lb/>That not an ant may sleep aggrieved by me.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>Twas thus he spake with many tears to God:
<lb/>Canst find within the world a king like him?
<lb/>Then from his place of prayer he sought his throne,
<lb/>And they prepared to quit Gurgan. The blast
<lb/>Of trumpets and the din of brazen cymbals
<lb/>Ascended from the court. He called to horse,
<lb/>And loaded up, invoking the All-giver.
<lb/>He took dinars, brocade, crowns, belts, and treasures
<lb/>Of drachms and gems, steeds, female slaves, and crowns,
<lb/>The turquoise litter and the ivory throne.
<lb/>The heart-alluring handmaids and the thralls
<lb/>Of all descriptions mounted on the saddle.
<lb/>The Shah dispatched them all to Taisafin,
<lb/>Preceded by the women-folk of Chin,
<lb/>Who fared auspiciously and cheerfully
<lb/>Surrounded by the eunuchs. As high priest,
<lb/>Mihran Sitad accompanied the queen,
<lb/>The daughter of the Khan, and thus the treasures
<lb/>And baggage went toward Taisafin. A band
<lb/>Composed of warriors only—all the best
<lb/>And noblest of the mighty men—approached
<lb/>Afoot Azar Abadagan while troops
<lb/>Came from each province, soldiers from Gilan
<lb/>And Dilaman, the mountains of Balich,
<lb/>And deserts of Sartch, and warriors
<lb/>From Lich, all came with gifts and offerings
<lb/>Before the tent-enclosure of the king,
<lb/>Whereat the famous chiefs rejoiced and thought:—
<lb/><q>The wolf’s claws grow too short to reach the sheep!</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>World without end strife with Balach had raged,
<lb/>And filled the cities with distress and anguish,
<lb/>But by the Grace of Nushirwan the sky
<lb/>Had changed its use and favour. Wheresoever
<lb/>The host was wont to pass it did not use
<lb/>To harm a crop, to ask for bread and water,
<lb/>But made its sleeping-quarters on its route.
<lb/>The Shah on this wise went about the world,
<lb/>Surveying every place, both field and waste.
<lb/>He saw that all the world was full of crops,
<lb/>While sheep and oxen filled the hills and plains.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1709"/>
<lb/>A region ne’er before inhabited,
<lb/>Where none had looked on sowing and on reaping,
<lb/>He now surveyed and found it bearing fruit,
<lb/>Found too a family in every house.
<lb/>The trees were laden through the Grace divine
<lb/>Of that victorious master of the world.
<lb/>At one stage of the progress of the Shah
<lb/>The ambassador of Caesar came with presents,
<lb/>With silver and withal a throne of gold,
<lb/>And Roman jewels and brocade—a gift
<lb/>That covered all the surface of the ground:
<lb/>So great a tribute ne’er had come from Rum.
<lb/>Ten ox-hides had been filled up with dinars—
<lb/>The tribute and the taxes of three years—
<lb/>And with the presents Caesar had dispatched

<pb n="363"/>
<lb/>A letter to the famous king. They set
<lb/>The envoy in the presence, and the Shah
<lb/>Was all attention while they read the letter.
<lb/>Twas full of warm expressions of good will
<lb/>About the gifts that had been sent to him:—
<lb/><q>Hereafter will I send thee greater gifts,
<lb/>For these are merely meant for largessing.</q>
<lb/>The Shah received them, mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And sought the temple of Azargashasp.
<lb/>When, still afar, he saw the place of worship
<lb/>His cheeks were hidden by his tears. He lighted
<lb/>Down from his steed and, sacred twigs in hand,
<lb/>Made prayer with bated breath; then drawing near
<lb/>The Fire he worshipped and adored the Maker.
<lb/>He gave the temple-bursar all the gold,
<lb/>And all the many gems that he had brought,
<lb/>And showered gold and silver on the archmages,
<lb/>Bestowing on them likewise gems and raiment,
<lb/>All were enriched by him and sought the Fire
<lb/>To offer up their thanks in muttered tones,
<lb/>And blessed withal the righteous judge of earth.
<lb/>He parted thence for Taisafin; the host
<lb/>Made earth a Mount Bistin. That righteous Shah,
<lb/>On reaching any city, used to give
<lb/>Much gold and silver to the mendicants.
<lb/>Through all the wealth that he disposed of thus
<lb/>The realm was stuffed with treasure and with drachms.
<lb/>From Taisafin he drew toward Mada’in,
<lb/>For there he wont to keep his treasuries’ key.
<lb/>He took the Rose of Chin and forty more
<lb/>Withal. Mihran Sitad fared on before.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><head>Discourse on the Justice of Nushirwan and how
Mortals had Peace under his Usages</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1710"/>
<p>When Nushirwan ascended to his throne
<lb/>In pomp, with his good fortune for his mate,
<lb/>The world was decked like Paradise with justice,
<lb/>With goodliness, and wealth, had rest from strife,
<lb/>Inequity, and bloodshed, everywhere,
<lb/>And was renewed by Grace divine. <q>They have,</q>
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said, <q>bound both the hands of evil.</q>
<lb/>None knew of pillage, raid, or putting forth
<lb/>The hand to ill; all came at his behest
<lb/>From darkness and perverseness to the way.
<lb/>If any dropped a drachm upon the road
<lb/>A thief would shun that wealth! As for brocade
<lb/>And for dinars, on land and sea, by daylight,
<lb/>And in the hours for sleep, the ill-disposed
<lb/>Would look not to that quarter out of fear,
<lb/>And through the justice of the Shah, the world-lord.
<lb/>The world was pargetted like Paradise,
<lb/>And dale and desert were fulfilled with wealth.
<lb/>Dispatches went to all the provinces,
<lb/>To every man of name and potentate,
<lb/>While from the Turkman merchants and from Chin,
<lb/>Saklab and every province, came such store
<lb/>Of musk-bags and of silk of Chin, of trinkets
<lb/>Of Rum and of the land of Hind, as made
<lb/>Iran like jocund Paradise; its dust
<lb/>Was ambergris, its bricks were gold. The world
<lb/>Turned toward Iran and rested from distress
<lb/>And bickering. <q>The breezes shed rose-water,</q></p>

<p>Thou wouldst have said, and men had peace from pain
<lb/>And leech. The moisture showered upon the rose
<pb n="365"/>
<lb/>In season, and the farmer was not sad
<lb/>Through lack of rain. The world grew full of herbage
<lb/>And cattle, plains and valleys were all flowers,
<lb/>Rooftrees, and dwellings, all the streams seemed seas,
<lb/>And roses Pleiad-like within the gardens.
<lb/>Men learned to speak new tongues within Iran,
<lb/>Illumed their souls with knowledge, and returned
<lb/>Thanksgiving to their guide, the Shah, for all
<lb/>The traffickers that came from every march
<lb/>And land, from Turkistan, Chin, Hind, and Rum,
<lb/>While cattle multiplied amid the herbage.
<lb/>All learned men and ready speakers found
<lb/>A place at court. The great, the men of lore,
<lb/>And archimages were esteemed, the wicked
<lb/>Shook fearful of calamity. What time
<lb/>The sun adorned the world a proclamation
<lb/>Would go up from the court: <q>All ye that are
<lb/>The servants of the monarch of the world!
<lb/>Keep not ill hidden, any one of you!
<lb/>Whoe’er hath toiled at any task shall have
<lb/>A treasure in proportion to his travail.
<lb/>Prefer your claims before our chamberlain
<lb/>That he may seek your recompense from us.
<lb/>If any creditor shall come and ask
<lb/>For payment from the poor, my treasurer
<lb/>Will pay the debt because the destitute
<milestone unit="calced" n="1711"/>
<lb/>Must not be troubled. Whosoe’er shall look
<lb/>Upon another's wife, and his accuser
<lb/>Appeal to us, the offender shall see naught
<lb/>But pit and gibbet, bondage in the pit,
<lb/>And arrows on the gibbet. If men find
<lb/>A horse at large, and any husbandman
<lb/>Complain thereof at court, let it be slain
<lb/>Upon that tilth, and he shall have the carcass
<lb/>Who had the scath, the horseman shall be horseless,
<lb/>And fare afoot before Azargashasp

<lb/>To tender his excuse, the muster-master
<lb/>Shall strike his name off from the muster-roll,
<lb/>They shall lay low his dwelling, and the offender,

<lb/>The Shah can not be of one mind with such,
<lb/>Will have the righteous only at his court,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><head>How Buzurjmihr counselled Nushirwan and discoursed
on good Deeds and Words</head>
<p>
<lb/>One day the world-lord, as he sat rejoicing,
<lb/>Gave audience to the mighty men of wisdom.
<lb/>He spake with smiles and open countenance,
<lb/>And seated Buzurjmihr upon the throne,
<lb/>Who offered to the king such praise as made
<lb/>His heart like jocund spring, and thus he said:—
<lb/><q>O righteous judge so fresh of visage! may
<lb/>Fault-finders never find a fault in thee.
<lb/>Blest king of kings, whose fortune prospereth,
<lb/>The wise, triumphant master of the world!
<lb/>I erst recorded in the olden tongue
<lb/>Some thoughts upon a roll of royal paper,
<lb/>Which I entrusted to thy treasurer
<lb/>Till there might come a season when the Shah
<lb/>Would read it, but I see the mystery
<lb/>Is one that laggard heaven will disclose not.
<lb/>What though a man shall quit his seat at feasts,
<lb/>And take his life within his hands in fight,
<lb/>Shall sweep the earth of enemies and be
<lb/>Secure against the toils of Ahrimans,
<lb/>Shall be the great king over all the world,
<lb/>And consummate his wishes one by one,
<pb n="367"/>
<lb/>Shall win the wide world by his bravery,
<lb/>Make rosary and pleasance, park and palace,
<lb/>Shall lay up wealth, have sons surrounding him,
<lb/>And reckon many days of happiness,
<lb/>Shall bring together warriors and wealth,
<lb/>Shall decorate his palaces and halls,
<lb/>And, while the poor are toiling for his sake,
<lb/>Amass on all sides treasure and renown,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1712"/>
<lb/>Still willy nilly he but gathereth dust;
<lb/>His lifetime will not last a century.
<lb/>He will be dust, his toils will bear no fruit
<lb/>For him, and all his wealth will be his foe’s.
<lb/>No children, throne or crown or royal hall,
<lb/>Or treasury or army will be his,
<lb/>And when he ceaseth to pursue the wind
<lb/>None in the world will give a thought to him.
<lb/>Of all his doings when his time is over
<lb/>A good name will be his memorial.
<lb/>In this world there are two things that endure,
<lb/>And only two, the rest will last with none—
<lb/>Choice sayings and good doings: these will last
<lb/>Until the world shall end, auspicious Shah!
<lb/>Time’s course is such that fame and honest speech
<lb/>Spoil not through sun and water, wind and dust.
<lb/>The modest man and virtuous is blest.
<lb/>Avoid, O king! with all thy might the faults
<lb/>That shame the soul. Harm not but help; thus Faith
<lb/>And precedent prescribe. I leave behind me
<lb/>Words that, I ween, ne’er will grow obsolete.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He oped the king’s shrewd heart who questioned him
<lb/>On many points: <q>Who is the glorious man,
<lb/>Whose heart is glad, who sigheth not?</q>
</p>

<p>He answered :—
<lb/><q>The innocent, the man whom Ahriman
<lb/>Hath caused not to transgress.</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The Shah then asked him
<pb n="368"/>
<lb/>Concerning guile, the Div’s way, and the way
<lb/>Of God, the world’s Lord. Buzurjmihr replied:—
<lb/><q>To do God’s will is best, for in both worlds.
<lb/>The Grace is His. The door of evil leadeth
<lb/>To Ahriman who is the enemy
<lb/>Of those that worship God. The high-souled man
<lb/>Is blesséd in the world, for his adornments
<lb/>Are holiness and modesty. Since knowledge
<lb/>Safe-guardeth him his life is one of ease,
<lb/>He hath nobility and righteousness,
<lb/>And knocketh not upon the door of guile,
<lb/>And loss. When he is dead his soul will be
<lb/>A foe to what pertaineth to the body.
<lb/>He is not negligent about them both,
<lb/>But is concerned for either sword or scabbard.</q><note n="1">Five couplets omitted.</note>
</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1713"/>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan inquired: <q>Among the chiefs
<lb/>What man attaineth to the highest standard?</q>
<lb/>Said Buzurjmihr: <q>The man that hath most knowledge,
<lb/>And most controlment over his desires.</q>
<lb/><q>Who is the man of knowledge,</q> said the Shah,
<lb/><q>For knowledge is a matter hid in men?</q>
<lb/><q>The man that neither severeth heart from God,</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He answered, <q>at the bidding of the Div,
<lb/>Nor out of wantonness obeyeth one
<lb/>That is the foe of souls and wisdom’s snare.
<lb/>Ten Ahrimans there are with lion’s might,
<lb/>Who lord it over wisdom and the soul.</q>
<lb/><q>What then are these ten divs,</q> said Nushirwan,
<lb/><q>Since wisdom hath good reason to bewail them?</q>
<lb/>He thus made answer, saying: <q>Greed and Need
<lb/>Are two o’erweening divs and puissant.<note n="2">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 146.</note>
<lb/>The rest are Anger, Envy, Strife, Revenge,
<lb/>Backbiting, Treachery, and Faith Impure.
<lb/>The tenth div is Ingratitude to men

<pb n="369"/>
<lb/>For benefits and Ignorance of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Of these ten divs, ruinous
<lb/>And black, which Ahriman is lustiest?</q>
<lb/>He answered Nushirwan thus, saying: <q>Greed
<lb/>Is a tyrannic div, the last to go.
<lb/>Him never wilt thou see content in aught,
<lb/>But ever labouring for something more.
<lb/>All those that look on Need behold him blind,
<lb/>And sallow with anxiety and pain.
<lb/>The div of Envy is the next, O king!
<lb/>And is an ailment that no leech can cure.
<lb/>His soul is pained to see one prosperous.
<lb/>Strife is another div and passionate,
<lb/>For ever quick to put his hand to ill;
<lb/>Revenge, another, wrathful, turbulent,
<lb/>And instant to arouse the battle-cry
<lb/>In men, unloving and ungenerous—
<lb/>A div malignant and with frowning face;
<lb/>Another, Slander, knowing naught but lies,
<lb/>And doing all his traffic in the dark;
<lb/>Another, Treachery, with double face,
<lb/>Who feareth not the Master of the world,
<lb/>But flingeth strife and vengeance twixt two men,
<lb/>And toileth to break up alliances:
<lb/>The last, Ingratitude and Ignorance—
<lb/>A witless div unconscious of all good,
<lb/>Contemptuous of rede and modesty,
<lb/>And in whose sight both good and ill are one.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The king then asked the sage: <q>How doth the Div
<lb/>Make war against the heart, and what hath God
<lb/>Bestowed upon His servants so that they
<lb/>May counteract the Div?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That man of Faith
<lb/>Replied: <q>Wise, glorious Shah! against the sword
<lb/>Of divs the coat of mail is wisdom; that
<pb n="370"/>
<lb/>Illumineth the sage’s heart and mind,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1714"/>
<lb/>Recordeth what is passed and nourisheth
<lb/>The soul with knowledge. Oh! may wisdom be
<lb/>The guider of thy mind because the way
<lb/>Is long before thee, and if wisdom prove
<lb/>A second nature, as the saying is,
<lb/>So that the heart is fearless of the Div,
<lb/>The good heart will find pleasure in the world,
<lb/>And not frequent the portal of desire.
<lb/>Now will I utter words of hope to guide
<lb/>The heart to joy: the sage is always hopeful,
<lb/>And seeth naught but happiness from time,
<lb/>Not for a moment meditateth ill,
<lb/>And chooseth not the bow’s path but the arrow’s.
<lb/>Moreover one contented doth not stretch
<lb/>His hand to treasure or fatigue himself;
<lb/>He that despiseth drachm and treasury
<lb/>Will fleet his sum of days in happiness.
<lb/>Moreover one that is devote to God<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>In all will turn not from His ordinance
<lb/>For toil or treasure or the fear of man;
<lb/>He hath no strain of evil in his nature,
<lb/>And by that token he is virtuous too
<lb/>Because he will sell not God’s way for aught.</q>
<lb/>Said Nashirwan: <q>Which is the royal way
<lb/>Conducting us to good?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He answered thus:—
<lb/><q>The way of wisdom doubtlessly surpasseth
<lb/>All knowledge. Likewise being well disposed
<lb/>Will keep a man in honour all his days;
<lb/>While of the qualities the mightiest
<lb/>Is in my view contentment with one’s lot;
<lb/>The most agreeable, which refresheth most
<lb/>In travail, and the seemliest, is hope.
<lb/>In greed I see the weariest of all,
<pb n="371"/>
<lb/>For that is never satiate of wealth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Which accomplishment is best,
<lb/>The one whereby aspirants win to greatness?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He answered: <q>Knowledge, for the sage is greatest
<lb/>Among the great as clutching not at treasure,
<lb/>And holding of himself aloof from travail.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah then asked him: <q>How shall we proceed
<lb/>To overcome the might of enemies?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>Ill-doing is the enemy,</q> he answered,
<lb/><q>Alike of wisdom and the soul serene.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The righteous judge then asked the sage and said:—
<lb/><q>Is talent or is application better?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The sage made answer, saying: <q>Application
<lb/>Is more than natural ability,
<lb/>For application furnisheth the mind,
<lb/>While talent only maketh talking easy,
<lb/>And, when untrained, is wretched, vile, and weak,
<lb/>But application strengtheneth the soul.</q>
<lb/><q>How can the mind be polished,</q> said the Shah,
<lb/><q>And what accomplishments commend the body?</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1715"/>

<p>
<lb/><q>Now,</q> said he, <q>will I make a full reply,
<lb/>If thou wilt take it from me point by point:
<lb/>Since wisdom is itself God’s robe of honour—
<lb/>No thought can gain it and no evil touch it;
<lb/>So one accomplished but withal conceited
<lb/>Should have no credit for accomplishments,
<lb/>While no wise man regardeth with disdain
<lb/>The merest peasant well-disposed by nature,
<lb/>And though a sage join bounty to high birth,
<lb/>Join knowledge, conduct, equity, yet will
<lb/>His greatness, his addition, and uprightness
<lb/>All suffer if his natural bent be vicious.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Nashirwan inquired: <q>Illustrious scholar!
<lb/>Doth greatness come from toil or doth the world-lord
<lb/>Get crown and throne from fortune?</q>
<pb n="372"/>
<lb/><q>The fortune and accomplishment of men
<lb/>Are mates allied and joined like soul and body,
<lb/>The body visible, the soul concealed.
<lb/>The body is man’s instrument for toil,
<lb/>When wakeful fortune shall bestir itself,
<lb/>But by his travail ne’er will he attain
<lb/>To greatness if good fortune guide him not.
<lb/>Again, the world is all deceit and wind,
<lb/>Or memory of a dream that vanisheth
<lb/>When one awaketh, whether he beheld
<lb/>A pleasant vision or a painful one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>A question then occurred to Nishirwan;
<lb/>He asked the sage: <q>Who should be praised?</q>
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/><q>A king that doth adorn the throne and hath
<lb/>His strength from fortune will, if he doth justly,
<lb/>And is of fair repute, attain his end
<lb/>In word and deed.</q>
<lb/><q>What man is sorrowful,</q>
<lb/>The Shah said, <q>luckless, and unprofitable?</q>
<lb/>The sage replied: <q>The wicked mendicant,
<lb/>Who loseth both this world and Paradise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/><q>Who is the luckless one,</q> rejoined the Shah,
<lb/><q>For whom we must weep always bitterly?</q>
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr replied: <q>The man of knowledge,
<lb/>Whose face is sallow through his evil deeds.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah asked further: <q>Who is the contented,
<lb/>And who is anxious to increase his store?</q>
<lb/>He made response: <q>He that regardeth not
<lb/>The revolutions of the turning sky.</q>
<lb/>Then Nishirwen: <q>What man best suiteth us?</q>
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr replied: <q>The gentlest man.</q>
<lb/><q>But who is gentle,</q> asked the Shah, <q>for why
<lb/>The hasty give us cause to weep!</q>
<pb n="373"/>
<lb/><q>Mark him that shunneth converse with fault-finders;
<lb/>That man hath modesty and gentleness,
<lb/>With wisdom, counsel, and propriety.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The famed king asked him: <q>Who is hopefullest
<lb/>Of men?</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1716"/>
<lb/><q>The most industrious,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Whose ears are open unto knowledge most.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch of the world inquired of him
<lb/>Of privy rumour as to good and ill.
<lb/>He thus returned reply: <q>It is the cause
<lb/>Of ample chatter but an empty brain.
<lb/>Say what they will the earth is still in place;
<lb/>I know not how the other world doth fare.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan: <q>What land most prospereth,
<lb/>And how have we contributed therein?</q>
<lb/><q>The justice of the world-lord,</q> he replied,
<lb/><q>Establisheth a land’s prosperity.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan inquired: <q>Inform me this:
<lb/>What man is shrewdest, most approved, and prudent
<lb/>Within the world because the adept increaseth
<lb/>One’s lustre?</q>
<lb/>He replied: <q>An ancient sage
<lb/>That hath been mindful of experience.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Nushirwan: <q>Who is the happy man
<lb/>That liveth upright and right glad?</q>
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/><q>One free from apprehension and possessed
<lb/>Of gold and silver.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Nashirwan inquired:—
<lb/><q>Which of us best deserveth praise, and who
<lb/>Is most approved by all?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus:—
<lb/><q>He that can hide his need and can suppress
<lb/>Strife, envy, greed, revenge, and jealousy:
<lb/>That man will find approval in the world.</q>
<pb n="374"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah inquired of the long-suffering,
<lb/>Whose crown is patience.
<lb/>Buzurjmihr replied:—
<lb/><q>That is the man grown hopeless, with heart dark,
<lb/>And yet his counsel is sun-bright, or else
<lb/>The man that hath but little time to live,
<lb/>And yet hath entered on some vast employ.</q>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Who hath grief so much at heart
<lb/>That he is weary of his life through care?</q>
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr made answer thus: <q>The man
<lb/>Fall’n from a throne and desperate of fortune.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The exalted king inquired of him and said:—
<lb/><q>Who of us hath his heart in sorry plight?</q>
<lb/>The sage replied: <q>The man that is not wise,
<lb/>And rich man childless.</q>
<lb/><q>Whose heart,</q> asked the Shah,
<lb/><q>Is sad through trouble and calamity?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>The upright man of knowledge
<lb/>O’er whom besottedness is sovereign.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>Who is fullest of despair
<lb/>Although possessing power and reputation?</q>
<lb/><q>The man that falleth from a lofty throne,</q>
<lb/>He said, <q>retaining still his pride of birth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Shah Nashirwan inquired of him and said:—
<lb/><q>O man of foresight and of ardent soul!
<lb/>Whom knowest thou unfamed and lustreless,
<lb/>And yet deserving both of love and pardon?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>The man of many faults,
<lb/>The culpable, the mendicant, and needy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1717"/>
<lb/>The Shah inquired and said: <q>Now tell me truly:
<lb/>Who is it that repenteth of the past?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>The great king who, when he shall put
<lb/>The black cap on upon his dying-day,<note n="1">Cf. Vol. i. p. 109.</note>
<lb/>Repenteth with a heart all terror-stricken
<pb n="375"/>
<lb/>Of all his life’s ingratitude to God,
<lb/>And he moreover who hath undergone
<lb/>Abundant travail for ungrateful men.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>The Shah inquired: <q>O sage that dost combine
<lb/>All excellence! know’st thou of aught that maketh
<lb/>The body profitable and is dear
<lb/>To all men’s hearts withal?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He made reply:—
<lb/><q>In health the heart will seek but happiness,
<lb/>But when through suffering the life is failing
<lb/>The body’s one desire is then for health.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah rejoined: <q>Good man! expound to me
<lb/>Which is the strongest of the appetites?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bazurjmihr: <q>The great are not exposed
<lb/>To such solicitings and, since their bodies,
<lb/>Which have no wish unsatisfied, fare well,
<lb/>Have only need to seek their heart’s desire.</q>
<lb/>The Shah then asked his guide: <q>What is the heart’s
<lb/>Chief care?</q>
<lb/><q>The sage,</q> he answered, <q>would inform
<lb/>His questioner that there are three chief cares—
<lb/>First, apprehension of the evil day,
<lb/>Lest ill then should befall the innocent;
<lb/>Next, of the practice of a treacherous friend,
<lb/>Who fain would have brain, life and blood and skin;
<lb/>And thirdly, of a great but unjust king,
<lb/>Who knoweth not the worthless from the good.
<lb/>How happy is the course of time with him
<lb/>That hath a prudent friend and counsellor!
<lb/>A bright world and a great king who is just—
<lb/>Thou’lt get from heaven no greater excellence.</q>
</p>
<p>

<lb/>The Shah next asked of Faith and right—the means
<lb/>Of banning fraud and falsehood. He replied:—
<lb/><q>Incline, O Shah! to one of Faith whose mind
<lb/>Is filled with thoughts of God—the man averse
<lb/>From guile and from the Div’s way through his awe
<lb/>Of holy God, the Master of the world,
<lb/>And hearkening to His law. None such will barter
<lb/>The Faith.</q>

<pb n="376"/>

<lb/>The Shah then asked concerning kings,
<lb/>Whose rule is o’er the holy: <q>Which of them
<lb/>Is of victorious fortune and throne-worthy?</q>
<lb/>He answered thus: <q>The just possessed of wisdom,
<lb/>Of counsel,<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> modesty, and excellence.</q>

<lb/>The Shah then questioned him about old friends,
<lb/>Such as are one with us in ear and speech.
<lb/>He made this answer: <q>Magnanimity
<lb/>And generosity are good in them;
<lb/>They will wish thee no ill to please another,
<lb/>But aid and succour thee in thy distress.</q>

<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1718"/>
<lb/>Said Nushirwan to him: <q>Who hath most
<lb/>friends
<lb/>That are to him as his own blood and skin?</q>
<lb/>He thus gave answer: <q>Save the faithless man
<lb/>All would be joined to him whose heart is good,
<lb/>And all the more the kinder that he is,
<lb/>The more obliging, and conformable.</q>

<lb/>The Shah inquired: <q>Who hath most enemies
<lb/>And most antagonistic?</q>
<lb/>Buazurjmihr
<lb/>Returned him this reply: <q>The insolent,
<lb/>For he incurreth many a malison,
<lb/>And also any one that speaketh harshly,
<lb/>Is ever frowning, and is close of fist.</q>

<lb/>Then said the Shah: <q>Who is the constant friend,
<lb/>One who will weep for pain of severance?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>‘Tis the friend that faileth not,
<lb/>Is never vexed, and feareth not to suffer.</q>

<pb n="377"/>

<lb/><q>What lasteth,</q> said the Shah, <q>and doth not waste?</q>
<lb/>He made reply: <q>A benefit conferred
<lb/>Is ever present to a worthy friend.</q>
<lb/><q>What hath the chiefest lustre,</q> said the Shah,
<lb/><q>And is a crown upon the head of all?</q>
<lb/>He said: <q>The sage’s mind which mastereth
<lb/>His passions.</q>

<lb/>Said the Shah: <q>O lord of love!
<lb/>What is there wider than the turning sky?</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>First, a king with open hand,
<lb/>And next, the heart of one devoted to God.</q>

<lb/>The Shah inquired: <q>What is the goodliest way
<lb/>Wherein a wise man may exalt his head?</q>
<lb/><q>O great king! ne’er bestow,</q> he made reply,
<lb/><q>Thy treasure on unholy men. For thee
<lb/>To deal with the unthankful is to fling
<lb/>Bricks unbaked into water.</q>

<lb/>Said the Shah:—
<lb/><q>What toil diminisheth man’s greed for treasure?</q>
<lb/>Then Bazurjmihr replied: <q>O king! for ever
<lb/>Be thy heart like young spring. For very travail
<lb/>The servant of a king of evil nature
<lb/>Will cease to care for person, life, and wealth.</q>

<lb/>The Shah inquired: <q>‘What wonder hast thou seen
<lb/>Than which a greater cannot be conceived?</q>
<lb/>And Buzurjmihr made answer to the Shah:—
<lb/><q>The turning sky is always wonderful.
<lb/>Thou seest one possessed of mastery,
<lb/>With crown exalted to the darksome clouds,
<lb/>Who cannot tell his left hand from his right,
<lb/>Or fortune’s gain from loss discriminate;
<lb/>Another man will read the lofty sky,
<lb/>And tell the why and the wherefore of the stars,
<lb/>Yet heaven still will lead him into straits,
<lb/>And evil fortune be his only lot!</q>

<pb n="378"/>

<lb/><q>What thing know’st thou, as heaviest,</q> asked the Shah?
<lb/>He thus returned reply: <q>The weight of sin.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah inquired: <q>Of matters most unseemly,
<lb/>Including in the question words and deeds,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1719"/>
<lb/>Which is the greatest cause of shame and blame,
<lb/>So that all folk pronounce it done amiss?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: <q>Harshness in a king;
<lb/>The persecution of the innocent;
<lb/>The nearness practised by the man of wealth
<lb/>That is a niggard as to dress and food;
<lb/>In womankind the loud and strident voice
<lb/>Of those whose modesty is forfeited;
<lb/>The infamy of men that do oppression,
<lb/>And are high-handed with the indigent;
<lb/>While falsehood in a king or in a man
<lb/>Of no account is ugly, foul, and vile.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Of all things in the world, apert or secret,
<lb/><q>What is that goodly one,</q> said Nushirwan,
<lb/><q>Whereof the sage will fashion him a breastplate,
<lb/>And therewithal illuminate his soul?</q>
<lb/>The sage made answer: <q>Earnestness of Faith
<lb/>Will have but approbation from the world,
<lb/>And secondly thanksgiving unto God
<lb/>Charactereth a wise and holy man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Nushirwan: <q>What is it best for kings
<lb/>And mighty men to do and to avoid?
<lb/>What is there better than to rule, possess,
<lb/>And look on others as inferiors?
<lb/>From what do we do wisely to refrain,
<lb/>And what is good to seize upon and keep?</q>
<lb/>The sage replied: <q>Safeguard thy wrath as knowing
<lb/>That other folk will keep their eyes on thee;
<lb/>Next, let thy soul be ever on the watch,
<lb/>And do thine utmost to abstain from ill.


<pb n="379"/>


<lb/>The soul of him that will forgo revenge,
<lb/>And hope instead, will shine as doth the sun.
<lb/>By means of sin thou wilt have many pleasures;
<lb/>Reject such pleasures and avoid the sin.</q>
<lb/>Thanks to the Master of the moon and sun
<lb/>The parle of Bazurjmihr and Shah is done.

<div><head>PART IV: THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GAME OF CHESS INTO IRAN. THE LEGEND OF THE INVENTION OF THE GAME. THE DISCOVERY OF THE BOOK OF KALILA AND DIMNA</head><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<pb n="380"/>
<p>The Raja of Hind sends an envoy to Nushirwan with the game of chess, proposing certain conditions which the Shah accepts and, with the help of Buzurjmihr, carries out. Buzurjmihr invents the game of nard, and the Shah sends him with it to the Raja, proposing similar conditions. The poet then tells the legend of the invention of chess—how two sons of an Indian queen quarrelled about the succession to her throne, how one of them perished and how the other, to console his mother, invented the game. Lastly the poet tells how a prince tributary to Nushirwan was sent at his own request to Hind to find the herb that restores the dead to life, and returned bringing instead the Fables of Bidpai.</p>

<p>§§ 1-3, Here, as in the case of the Yatkar-i-Zariran<note n="1">See Vol. v. p. 24.</note> and the Karnimak,<note n="2">Id. vi. 195.</note> we are brought into contact with an extant Pahlavi Text—the Tshatrang Nimak—which was undoubtedly one of Firdausi’s indirect authorities. It was written, probably, about the seventh century A.D. and tells how the king of Hind—Déwasdrm—sent an embassy to Nushirwan with gifts and the game of chess which he had invented. The chess-men were one half of emeralds and the other half of rubies. If the Iranians, he writes to Nushirwan, cannot explain the meaning of the game they must pay him tribute or vice versa. None can find the meaning till Buzurjmihr, who has been keeping himself in reserve, appears on the third day, expounds the principle of chess,

<pb n="381"/>

and proceeds to win twelve games against Déwasarm’s envoy. Buzurjmihr then invents nard, which is a form of backgammon, takes it to Hind, puzzles the sages there with it, and returns triumphant with double tribute. The similarity of the Pahlavi Text to the Shahnameh therefore is obvious. Probably in the original story, no longer extant, the problem set was comparatively a simple one: <q>What did the board and pieces represent?</q></p>

<p>And the answer would be: <q>A battlefield.</q> The misplaced ingenuity of later redactors, however, has added impossible details. A clever man of the time might guess by what the game had been suggested, but the greatest that ever lived could not have evolved the method of play from his inner consciousness, assuming of course his complete previous ignorance of the game. The Pahlavi Text gives the answer correctly and then proceeds to make Buzurjmihr win twelve games right off! In the Shahnameh, the Indian envoy himself gives away the whole thing by stating what the game represents, and then Buzurjmihr in retirement discovers the powers of the various pieces and the way in which they are manipulated—an impossible achievement. It will be observed that Firdausi describes two forms of the game—that introduced into Persia for a board of sixty-four squares, and that, which he considers to be the original, for a board of one hundred squares. The powers of most of the pieces have altered since those days. The tethered minister has changed his sex, become the king’s better half, and has acquired as much liberty and preponderance as the most emancipated lady could desire, but the knight’s ingenious move has passed unchanged through all vicissitudes.</p>

<p>
The Persian word <foreign>nard</foreign> means a tree-trunk, and it seems not unreasonable to imagine that the game got its name from the resemblance of the pieces on the board to tree-stumps. The author of the Tshatrang-Nimak, however, tells us that the game was named after the founder of the Sasanian Dynasty, Nau-Ardshir, which became contracted into nard. Like chess it is symbolical and represents human life as swayed or moulded by fate or fortune whose decrees are written in the aspects of the stars and planets. Thus the board represents the earth, the thirty pieces the days of the month, the colour of the pieces the nights and days, etc. Each throw of the dice too had its proper symbolism. The first represented the Unity of Urmuzd, the second the duality of heaven and earth, the third the triad of Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds, the fourth the four temperaments—dry, damp, warm, and cold, and so forth. Later Arabic writers
<pb n="382"/>
elaborated the symbolism considerably. The dice were taken to represent the heavens and their motions, and the markings on the dice the seven planets in as much as the numbers on the opposite sides added together always make up the number seven, one being opposite to six, two to five, and three to four. The result of a throw was the decree of fate, etc. Nard may be said therefore to surpass chess in sublimity of conception as much as chess surpasses nard in its demands upon the intellect. Firdausi does not tell us how nard was played, and the introduction of the two kings, apparently on the analogy of those at chess, is quite beside the mark. The poet’s whole story of the way in which chess was brought into Iran, and the invention of nard, is quite unhistorical. We have had already in this volume <note>See p. 102.</note> an instance of one king propounding hard questions to another, and in the next volume we shall have the problem of the mysterious box, on the elucidation of which a wager depends as in the present case. According to Mas’udi, nard was invented before chess and before the days of Porus, and chess in the time of one of that king’s successors, but he also states that the invention of nard has been attributed to Ardshir Papakan. <note>MM, i. 157 seq.</note> Elsewhere Mas’udi tells us that Nushirwan had the book of Kalila and Dimna, chess, and a black hair-dye, brought from Hind. <note>Id. ii. 203. For the above generally see NPS, II, p. 20 seq. ; HS, ii. 250 seq.</note>
</p>

<p>§3. Shahwi, Firdausi’s authority for his story of the invention of chess, perhaps may be identified with the Miahwi who collaborated with four others in the work of putting the Bistan-nima into modern Persian in the tenth century A.D.<note>See Vol. i. p. 67; NIN, p. 15.</note></p>

<p>§4. Shadin, son of Barzin, was, it would seem, another of the five above-mentioned collaborators.<note>Id.</note></p>

<p>
We appear to be here on much firmer historical ground than in the corresponding stories of the introduction of chess and the invention of nard. That the Fables of Bidpai were brought from Hind to Persia in the reign of Niushirwin, and translated from the Sanscrit into Pahlavi by Barzwi, seems to be admitted generally, though of course we need not accept all the details of Firdausi’s version of the transaction. He is not very accurate in what he says with regard to the later literary history of the famous book. It was not translated into Arabic for the first time in the reign of the Khalifa Mamun (A.D. 813-833) but in the previous century by Ibn Mukaffa.<note>For whom see Vol. vi. p. 17.</note> Firdausi is correct, however, in stating that the Fables were translated into Persian verse by the first great modern Persian poet, Rudaki, who enjoyed for many years the munificent patronage of the Samanid prince, Nasr son of Ahmad (A.D. 914-943), and of the minister Abu-Fazl, and died in A.D. 954. Unfortunately, only fragments of Rudaki’s translation survive. The poet is said to have been blind.
</p>

<pb n="383"/>

<p>
To compare small things with great, the Fables of Bidpai rival the Romance cycle of Alexander in the extent of their diffusion. They are said to have been translated into thirty-eight languages.<note>JVB, p. xii.</note> It is not possible to enter into the subject here, but one illustration of the way in which the Fables passed from one language into another may be given. The earliest English version of them is that of Sir Thomas North—the translator of Plutarch’s Lives, which Shakespeare put to such good account—and it was published in 1570 under the title of The Morall Philosophie of Doni. It comes to us as Sir Walter Blunt came to Henry IV,
<quote><l>Stain’d with the variation of each soil</l></quote>
through which it has passed, and its provenance is as follows: <q>It is the English version of an Italian adaptation of a Spanish translation of a Latin version of a Hebrew translation of an Arabic adaptation of the Pehlevi version of the Indian original.</q><note>Id. p. xi.</note> In Sir Thomas North’s version, owing, it is said, to a misunderstanding of the letters when the Fables were translated from the Hebrew, Nushirwin appears as Anestres Castri.<note>Id. p. XLIxxii.</note> It is interesting to find that the wish expressed to Niushirwin by Barzwi<note>See p. 429.</note> has been gratified. After all the vicissitudes through which the book has passed, his name and the story of his discovery of the Fables still survive. In the English version, he appears as Berozias.<note>JFB, p. 34 seq.</note> We may add that apparently the Fables themselves may be traced back to the Indian Jatakas or Birth Stories of Buddha,<note>Id., pp. xiii., xlix.</note> and that the Jewish race, to which the world is indebted for at least three religions, was the chief agent in the wide dissemination of the fables and the scientific study thereof.<note>Id. p. xxv.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><head>How the Raja of Hind sent the Game of Chess to Nushirwan</head>
<pb n="384"/>
<p>
<lb/>Since this discourse, which so delighted thee,
<lb/>Hath reached its end let chess our next theme be.
<lb/>Thus said the archimage: The Shah one day
<lb/>Adorned his throne with the brocade of Rum,
<lb/>And hung the crown above the ivory throne—
<lb/>A throne compact of teak and ivory.
<lb/>The palace seemed all throne, the throne all Shah,
<lb/>And all his court an army. All the palace
<lb/>Was occupied by marchlords and archmages
<lb/>From Balkh, Bukhara, and from every side.
<lb/>The monarch of the world received these tidings,
<lb/>Brought by his vigilant intelligencers:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1720"/>
<lb/><q>The envoy of the king of Hind hath come
<lb/>With elephants, with parasols, with horsemen
<lb/>Of Sind and laden camels fifty score,
<lb/>And seeketh to have access to the king.</q>
<lb/>The watchful Shah, on hearing this, forthwith
<lb/>Sent certain troops to go and welcome him.
<lb/>The envoy of that famed and puissant prince,
<lb/>On coming to the great king’s presence, did
<lb/>Obeisance, as the use of nobles is,
<lb/>With praises of the Maker of the world,
<lb/>And gave the Shah abundant gems as gifts,
<lb/>With earrings, elephants, and parasols.
<lb/>These Indian parasols were decked with gold
<lb/>With many sorts of jewels set therein.
<lb/>He oped the bales within the court itself,
<lb/>And brought their whole contents before the Shah.
<lb/>There were much gold and silver in the bales
<lb/>With musk, fresh aloe-wood, and ambergris,
<lb/>Gems, diamonds, and burnished Indian swords;
<pb n="385"/>
<lb/>The Raja had amassed from every hand
<lb/>The products of Kannauj and Malwa. They laid them
<lb/>Before the throne. The prince of sleepless fortune
<lb/>Viewed and dispatched to his own treasury
<lb/>All that the Raja had so toiled for. Then
<lb/>The envoy brought a letter which the Raja
<lb/>Had written upon silk to Nushirwan,
<lb/>And also, what had made a treasury void,
<lb/>A chess-board wrought with cunning workmanship.
<lb/>The man of Hind thus gave the Raja’s message:—
<lb/><q>Mayst thou abide so long as heaven endureth!
<lb/>Bid those much travailed in the quest for knowledge
<lb/>To place this board, used in the game of chess,
<lb/>Before them and set all their wits to work
<lb/>To find out how that goodly game is played,
<lb/>To find out what the name is of each piece,
<lb/>The way to move it and its proper square,
<lb/>To find out footman, elephant, and host,
<lb/>Rukh, horse, and how to move wazir and king.
<lb/>If they discover all this goodly game,
<lb/>And prove themselves the betters of the wise,
<lb/>Then, as the Shah commandeth, I will send
<lb/>Full tribute to his court with all good will;
<lb/>But if the nobles of the Iranian folk
<lb/>Have not the knowledge to resolve the point,
<lb/>Then, since their knowledge is no match for ours,
<lb/>Let them not seek for tax and tribute hence,
<lb/>But rather pay a tribute unto us,
<lb/>Since knowledge is of all famed things the best.</q></p>

<p>Both heart and ear gave Nushirwan to him
<lb/>That on this wise discharged his embassage.
<lb/>They set the board and men before the Shah,
<lb/>Who looked upon the pieces for a while.
<lb/>Half of the set was made of ivory
<lb/>And bright, the other half of teak. The Shah,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1722"/>
<lb/>Whose fortune never slumbered, then inquired

<pb n="386"/>

<lb/>About the pieces’ shapes and that fair board.
<lb/>The envoy thus replied: <q>Tis all, O king!
<lb/>An emblem of the art of war, and thou
<lb/>Wilt see, when thou hast found it out, the tactics,
<lb/>The plan, and order of a battlefield.</q></p>

<p>The Shah said: <q>I require a se’nnight’s space :
<lb/>The eighth day we will play right willingly.</q></p>

<p>They had a pleasant residence prepared
<lb/>To lodge the ambassador, and then the chiefs
<lb/>And archimages that were counsellors
<lb/>All came before the Shah and with the chess-board
<lb/>In front of them considered it at large,
<lb/>Examined it, tried every device,
<lb/>And played with one another in all ways.
<lb/>One spake and questioned, and another heard,
<lb/>But none discovered how the game was played,
<lb/>And all departed louring. Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Came to the Shah, perceived him vexed and troubled,
<lb/>And saw ere he began the task its end.
<lb/><q>O great king,</q> thus he spake to Nushirwan,
<lb/><q>World-lord and vigilant whose word is law!
<lb/>I will discover all this goodly game,
<lb/>Employing wisdom as my guide therein.</q>
<lb/>The Shah replied: <q>Be this affair thy task,
<lb/>And thine moreover health and happiness,
<lb/>Else now the Raja of Kannauj will say:—
<lb/><q>The Shah hath not a single counsellor,</q>
<lb/>Which were a mighty slur upon the archmages,
<lb/>Court, throne, and men of wisdom.</q>
<lb/>But Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Then took away with him the board and men,
<lb/>And sat down with his thoughts intent thereon.
<lb/>He tried to play the game in every way,
<lb/>And sought to find the place for every piece.
<lb/>He found the game out in one day and night,

<pb n="387"/>

<lb/>Then hastened from his palace to the Shah,
<lb/>And said: <q>O Shah whose fortune triumpheth!
<lb/>These pieces and this goodly board have I
<lb/>Well studied and I understand it all,
<lb/>Helped by the fortune of the world’s great king.
<lb/>Tis fitting that the king of kings should be
<lb/>The first to see it played. Thou wilt declare:—
<lb/><q>It is indeed a battlefield!</q>Then call
<lb/>The Raja’s envoy and spectators also.</q>
<lb/>The king joyed at his words, saluted him
<lb/>As prosperous and fortunate, then bade
<lb/>The archimages, nobles, and famed sages
<lb/>Attend. He called the envoy of the Raja,
<lb/>And seated him before the famous throne.
<lb/>Said Buzurjmihr, that man of eloquence:—
<lb/><q>Priest of the Raja of the sunlike face!
<lb/>What were the words thy monarch said to thee
<lb/>About those pieces? Wisdom be thy mate.</q></p>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1722"/>
    <p><q>The illustrious Raja,</q> he replied, <q>when I
<lb/>Was quitting him said thus to me: <q>Convey
<lb/>These teak and ivory pieces to the throne
<lb/>Of him that is the master of the crown,
<lb/>And say: <q>Assemble to thee thine archmages
<lb/>And counsellors, and set before them these.
<lb/>If they find how to play this clever game
<lb/>In the approven way, and master it,
<lb/>We will dispatch unto thee purses, slaves,
<lb/>And tribute to the utmost of our powers.
<lb/>The king’s worth will arise from knowledge then,
<lb/>Not from his treasures, men, and lofty throne;
<lb/>But if he and his wise men fail herein,
<lb/>As being dark of counsel, then must he
<lb/>Demand no tribute from us and no treasure.
<lb/>His knowing soul then will regret past toils,
<lb/>Since, realising our shrewd hearts and counsel,
<lb/>He will dispatch still greater wealth to us.</q></q></q>

<pb n="388"/>

<lb/>Then Buzurjmihr brought and set up before
<lb/>The throne of him whose fortune never slept
<lb/>The board and men, and said to archimage
<lb/>And chief: <q>‘Ye sages pure of heart and wise!
<lb/>Heed well his words and his shrewd lord’s proposal.</q>
<lb/>The sage then fashioned him a battlefield,
<lb/>Whereon he gave the kings the central place,
<lb/>And drew their forces up to left and right,
<lb/>The footmen eager for the fray in front.
<lb/>Beside the king his prudent minister
<lb/>Was posted to advise him in the fight.
<lb/>The warrior-rukhs impetuous on their steeds
<lb/>Were at the wings and fought on right and left.
<lb/>Adjoining these the battle-chargers stood,
<lb/>So that the great king proved the Raja’s match,
<lb/>And then the elephants of war arrayed
<lb/>On either side both eager for the fight.
<lb/>When Buzurjmihr had thus disposed the host
<lb/>The whole assembly stood amazed thereat,
<lb/>The ambassador of Hind was sorely vexed,
<lb/>And marvelled at that man of sleepless fortune,
<lb/>He marvelled at that warlock of a man,
<lb/>And thus his musings ran while plunged in thought:—
<lb/><q>‘He never saw the board and game of chess,
<lb/>Or heard about it from the adepts of Hind!
<lb/>How hath he learned the fashion of the game?
<lb/>None else could take his office.</q></p>

<p>Nushirwan
<lb/>So treated Buzurjmihr that thou hadst said
<lb/>That fortune had unveiled its face before him.
<lb/>The king thereafter gave commands to fill
<lb/>A cup with royal gems. This and a purse,
<lb/>Dinars and steed with saddle on, gave he
<lb/>To Buzurjmihr and praised him mightily.</p>
</div>



<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How Buzurjmehr invented Nard, and how Nushirwan
sent it with a Letter to the Raja of Hind</head>
<pb n="389"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1723"/>
<p>The sage, upon returning to his home,
<lb/>Arranged a board and compasses before him,
<lb/>Selecting first of all a darkened room
<lb/>To make his wits more keen, then mused on chess
<lb/>And Indian subtlety, and mustering all
<lb/>His powers made wisdom wed his ardent heart,
<lb/>And meditating thus invented nard.
<lb/>He bade to make two dice of ivory
<lb/>With dots the colour of teak-wood thereon,
<lb/>Arrayed a field of battle as in chess,
<lb/>And drew up the opposing hosts for war,
<lb/>Arranging them in eight battalions,
<lb/>All ready for pitch-battles or for sieges.
<lb/>The ground was dark, the battlefield foursquare,
<lb/>Two noble, clement kings were in command,
<lb/>Who had a common movement on the field,
<lb/>But neither sought the other’s injury.
<lb/>The troops arrayed beneath their leadership
<lb/>For battle on both sides were keen for fight.
<lb/>If two friends catch an unsupported foe,
<lb/>The twain inflict defeat upon the one.
<lb/>He made the two kings move about the field
<lb/>In pomp surrounded by their several hosts,
<lb/>Each wheeling round about upon the other,
<lb/>And combating by turns on hill and plain.
<lb/>On this wise till one side was overthrown
<lb/>The armies of both monarchs kept the field.
<lb/>Twas thus that Buzurjmehr, as I have said,
<lb/>Invented nard, then went and told the Shah
<lb/>How from the moves of those imperious kings
<lb/>Came praise or blame, what powers the pieces had,

<pb n="390"/>

<lb/>And how the armies fought; these he set forth,
<lb/>And showed in detail to the Shah whose heart
<lb/>Was all astound; he needed all his wits,
<lb/>And said: <q>O man of ardent soul! mayst thou,
<lb/>And may thy fortune, still continue young.</q></p>

<p>He bade the keeper of the camels bring
<lb/>Two thousand to him and then loaded them
<lb/>With contributions raised from Rum and Chin,
<lb/>The Haitalians, from Makran, and from Iran,
<lb/>And from the treasury of the king of kings.
<lb/>The caravan departed from the court.
<lb/>Whenas the camel-loads were all arranged,
<lb/>And that concern was off the monarch’s heart,
<lb/>He called the Raja’s envoy unto him,
<lb/>And of his knowledge uttered many words.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1724"/>
<lb/>He wrote a letter to the Raja full
<lb/>Of learning, pleasantry, good sense, and counsel,
<lb/>And in the first place gave great praise to God,
<lb/>Who was his refuge from the lusty Div,
<lb/>Then <q>Raja, high renowned, of Hind,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Down from the river of Kannauj to Sind!
<lb/>Thy wise ambassador hath come to us
<lb/>With parasols, with elephants, and escort,
<lb/>With tribute and with chess, and I have heard
<lb/>The Raja’s embassage. The task is done.
<lb/>We asked the Indian sage for time, we decked
<lb/>Our soul with knowledge, and an archimage,
<lb/>A very prudent sage of holy rede,
<lb/>Hath sought and found out how the game is played.
<lb/>Now that wise archimage hath come before
<lb/>The exalted Raja at Kannauj and brought
<lb/>Two thousand heavy camel-loads of things
<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Acceptable—a keepsake for thyself—
<lb/>And we have substituted nard for chess.

<pb n="391"/>

<lb/>What man now will adventure on this game?
<lb/>There must be many a Brahman well advised,
<lb/>Who by his learning can discover it.
<lb/>The Raja may consign to treasury
<lb/>The riches that have been the envoy’s care,
<lb/>But if the Raja and his counsellors
<lb/>Shall try to find out nard, and fail therein,
<lb/>He must according to our covenant
<lb/>Load up as many camels as we sent,
<lb/>And send them back with ours and all their loads;
<lb/>Such is our pact and bargain.</q></p>

<p>Buzurjmehr,
<lb/>What time the sun was radiant in the sky,
<lb/>Departed from the portal of the Shah
<lb/>With baggage,<note>Reading with P.</note> letter, and the game of nard,
<lb/>His heart absorbed by thoughts of his campaign.
<lb/>On coming to the Raja from Iran,
<lb/>The Brahman acting willingly as guide,
<lb/>He went before the Raja’s throne, beheld
<lb/>His head, his fortunes, and his diadem,
<lb/>Praised him no little in the olden tongue,
<lb/>Then gave the royal letter, and repeated
<lb/>The verbal message of the king of kings.
<lb/>The Indian Raja’s face bloomed like a rose.
<lb/>The message spake of chess, the Raja’s pains,
<lb/>His tribute, how the game of chess had fared,
<lb/>The play, the pieces, and the king’s right moves,
<lb/>And those moreover of his counsellors.
<lb/>It told withal the achievement of the sage,
<lb/>Who had invented nard in rivalry,
<lb/>And ended thus: <q>Now let the Raja read
<lb/>The letter, act, and swerve not from the right.</q></p>

<p>The Raja’s face grew pallid at the words,
<lb/>On hearing that account of chess and nard.
<lb/>There came a great official and assigned

<pb n="392"/>

<lb/>A fitting lodging to the ambassador.
<lb/>They had a jocund residence prepared,
<lb/>And called for wine and harp and minstrelsy.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1725"/>
<lb/>The Raja asked a space of seven days,
<lb/>And all the Lights of learning came to him.
<lb/>He gathered all the elders of the realm,
<lb/>And laid the game of nard before them there.
<lb/>For one whole se’nnight all the shrewdest men
<lb/>Among the nobles, whether old or young,
<lb/>Sought to discover out of emulation,
<lb/>For fame and triumph, how the game was played;
<lb/>But to the Raja at the se’nnight’s end
<lb/>A sage said: <q>No one can make aught thereof,
<lb/>And wisdom must be wedded to his soul,
<lb/>Who from these pieces can invent a game.</q>
<lb/>The Raja’s heart was troubled at those sages,
<lb/>His soul was sorrowful, his brow contracted.
<lb/>Upon the ninth day Buzurjmehr arrived,
<lb/>With eager heart and furrowed face, and said:—
<lb/><q>The Shah accorded me no tarriance here,
<lb/>And he must not be straitened in his heart.</q></p>

<p>The learnéd magnates went aside and owned
<lb/>Their ignorance, while Buzurjmehr, on hearing,
<lb/>Sat down, and all the sages gave good heed
<lb/>While he set out the board of nard before them,
<lb/>And told the movements of the various pieces,
<lb/>Displayed the leader and his warlike troops,
<lb/>The king’s power and the order of the fight.
<lb/>The Raja and his counsellors were all
<lb/>Astound, the company in wonderment,
<lb/>At Buzurjmehr, the chiefs all lauded him,
<lb/>And hailed him as a holy sage. The Raja
<lb/>Interrogated him upon all lore,
<lb/>And he in each case gave a fit response.
<lb/>Then from the sages, from the searchers out
<lb/>Of knowledge, and the scholars rose a cry:—

<pb n="393"/>

<lb/><q>Behold an eloquent and learned man,
<lb/>Not merely skilled in games like chess and nard!</q>
<lb/>The Raja had two thousand camels brought,
<lb/>And laid on them the tribute of Kannauj,
<lb/>Gold, camphor, ambergris, and aloe-wood,
<lb/>As well as raiment, silver, pearls, and gems,
<lb/>With one year’s tribute, and dispatched it all
<lb/>From his court to the portal of the Shah.
<lb/>The Raja had a coronet and robe,
<lb/>That reached from head to foot, of his own wear
<lb/>Brought from his treasury and then bestowed them
<lb/>On Buzurjmehr, gave him much praise withal,
<lb/>And to his retinue abundant gifts.
<lb/>So from Kannauj departed Buzurjmehr
<lb/>With head exalted to the turning sky,
<lb/>With those two thousand camels brought by him,
<lb/>And all the gifts and tribute in his charge.
<lb/>No one had looked on such a caravan
<lb/>Before, and never had been greater wealth.
<lb/>He joyed at heart as bearing from the king
<lb/>Of Hind a script in Indian characters
<lb/>On silk: <q>The Raja and his mighty men
<lb/>Attest for good will, not for fear, that none
<milestone unit="calced" n="1726"/>
<lb/>Hath looked on any like Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>Or ever heard of one such from the priests,
<lb/>Or met one wiser than his minister,
<lb/>The treasurer of whose knowledge is the sky.
<lb/>The tribute for the year was sent before,
<lb/>And more shall be if thou demandest it,
<lb/>While in the matter of the games the stakes
<lb/>Have been sent likewise as agreed upon.</q></p>

<p>Now when the Shah gat tidings of his sage:—
<lb/><q>He hath arrived well satisfied and glad,</q>
<lb/>He was rejoiced at that intelligence,
<lb/>And bade the chiefs of city and of host,
<lb/>With elephants and kettledrums and tympanums,
<lb/>To sally forth to welcome Buzurjmehr.
<lb/>That honoured sage’s entry of the city
<lb/>Resembled that of some great conquering king,
<lb/>And when that man of lore approached the throne,
<lb/>And proffered praise exceedingly, the Shah,
<lb/>Lord of the world, embraced him and inquired
<lb/>About the Raja and the weary way,
<lb/>While Buzurjmehr told his experiences,
<lb/>His sleepless fortune and the love of heaven,
<lb/>Then brought the conquering Raja’s letter forth,
<lb/>And laid it down before the throne. The Shah
<lb/>Then gave command for Yazdagird, the scribe,
<lb/>To come before the knowledge-seeking king,
<lb/>And when he read the Raja’s letter all
<lb/>The company were in astonishment
<lb/>Both at the wit and rede of Buzurjmehr,
<lb/>And at the fortune of his sun-faced Shah,
<lb/>Who spake on this wise, saying: <q>‘God be praised
<lb/>That I have such a wise and holy sage.
<lb/>The great are servants of my crown and throne,
<lb/>And love of me hath filled their hearts and minds.</q>
<lb/>Thanks to the Lord of sun and moon, for He
<lb/>Bestoweth victory and mastery,
<lb/>That which I next shall utter will appear
<lb/>A tale more strange than that of Buzurjmehr,
<lb/>Whom heaven with such intelligence did bless:
<lb/>I tell the legend of Talhand and chess.</p>

<lb/>One puissant in treasure, troops, and arms,
<lb/>And everywhere renowned, Jamhir by name,
<lb/>And passing Fir himself in fame for valour.
<lb/>Such was this king, of such an ardent spirit,
<lb/>So vigilant and prudent, that from Bust
<milestone unit="calced" n="1727"/>
<lb/>And from Kashmir down to the march of Chin
<lb/>The chieftains homaged him, and all the world
<lb/>Was in his grasp, so mighty was his prowess.
<lb/>He had his dwelling-place at Sandali;
<lb/>Here was his throne, his treasures, and his troops,
<lb/>Here were his signet-ring and here his crown.
<lb/>Jamhir was worshipful, a man of lore,
<lb/>Pre-eminent in knowledge and distinction,
<lb/>And all his lieges, whether of his court
<lb/>Or of his city, joyed alike in him.
<lb/>He had a worthy wife, a prudent dame,
<lb/>Accomplished, learned, and one that injured none.
<lb/>One night a son was born to him just like
<lb/>His sire, who when he saw the youthful prince
<lb/>Bade call him Gav, but soon and suddenly
<lb/>The monarch sickened, told the queen his will,
<lb/>And died bequeathing unto Gav a world,
<lb/>Where justice ruled, though yet he was unfit,
<lb/>By reason of his infancy, for throne,
<lb/>For crown and girdle. All the chieftains’ heads
<lb/>Were full of dust, their hearts were sorrowful
<lb/>By reason of Jamhir, and all the world
<lb/>Still kept in mind the memory of his bounty,
<lb/>His feasts, and justice. Troops and citizens—
<lb/>Men, women, children—met and thus took counsel:
<lb/><q>This little infant wotteth not of host,
<lb/>Of justice, rigour, throne, and crown. The sway
<lb/>Will suffer if the ruler be not great.</q></p>

<p><lb/>The monarch had a brother who was wise,
<lb/>And fitted for the throne: his name was Mai.
<lb/>The dwelling-place of that idolater
<pb n="396"/>

<lb/>Was at Dambar, and all the veteran chiefs,
<lb/>In looking for a king, turned to Dambar
<lb/>Their face from Sandali, while of Kashmir
<lb/>The potentates up to the march of Chin
<lb/>Did homage to him as their sovereign.
<lb/>The exalted Mai came from Dambar and set
<lb/>His feet upon the throne of majesty,
<lb/>Placed on his head the crown worn by Jamhir,
<lb/>And ruled with justice and with bounteousness.
<lb/>He took to wife Gav’s mother, cherished her,
<lb/>And held her all as dear as his own life.
<lb/>The fay-faced dame became with child by Mai,
<lb/>And that illustrious lady bare a son,
<lb/>Whom Mai, that mighty monarch, named Talhand,
<lb/>And loved with all his soul. Now when the babe
<lb/>Was two years old and Gav was seven, and grown
<lb/>A lusty warrior dowered with Grace and stature,
<lb/>Mai ailed, his glad heart was espoused to care.
<lb/>He languished for two se’nnights’ space, then died,
<lb/>And passing left the world to other's hands.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1728"/>
<lb/>All Sandali was sorrowful and wept,
<lb/>And burned with pain of heart because of him.
<lb/>They spent a month in mourning for the king,
<lb/>And at the end thereof the whole host met,
<lb/>The great men and the warriors of the state—
<lb/>All that had part in wisdom. Much talk passed
<lb/>In that assembly on all points. At length
<lb/>A wise man thus addressed the counsellors:—
<lb/><q>This lady, who was once spouse to Jamhir,
<lb/>Hath kept herself at all times from ill-doing,
<lb/>In both her marriages hath sought the right,
<lb/>And followed after justice all her days.
<lb/>The lady is of noble lineage,
<lb/>Just, upright, and inspireth confidence.
<lb/>Tis best that she should be our queen, for she
<lb/>Remaineth—the memorial of two kings.</q>
<pb n="397"/>

<lb/>The assembly all assented thereunto,
<lb/>And then the sage addressed the wise queen thus:—
<lb/><q>Take thou the throne of thy two sons, for this
<lb/>Will make for greatness, and there is no choice.
<lb/>When they grow worthy of the throne resign
<lb/>To them the majesty, the wealth, and host,
<lb/>And be from that time forth their counsellor,
<lb/>Companion, minister, and best of friends.</q>
<lb/>The lady—fortune’s favourite—at these words
<lb/>Gave lustre to the crown and graced the throne,
<lb/>Grew kinder, more considerate, and just,
<lb/>And all the realm rejoiced in her. She chose
<lb/>Two men wise, holy, travelled, and accomplished,
<lb/>And to their charge entrusted both her sons—
<lb/>Those princes of high lineage and wise.
<lb/>Withal she never left them for a day,
<lb/>And found her happiness in seeing them.
<lb/>Now as they grew in lustiness and lore,
<lb/>Becoming mighty men in that regard,
<lb/>One or the other used to come alone
<lb/>To his good mother, ever and anon,
<lb/>And ask: <q>Which is the fittest of us twain,
<lb/>Most high of heart, most likely, and most shrewd?</q>
<lb/>And thus the mother would reply to both:—
<lb/><q>That I may know which is more excellent,
<lb/>Show prowess, counsel, self-control, and Faith,
<lb/>Fair speech, and an ambition to be praised;
<lb/>For wisdom, modesty, self-governance,
<lb/>And justice, are required since ye are both
<lb/>Of royal birth.</q></p>

<p>When one of them would come
<lb/>Alone at whiles before her and inquire:—
<lb/><q>Which of us twain will have the sovereignty,
<lb/>Which of us have the treasure, throne, and crown?</q>
<lb/>Then would she answer him: <q>The throne is thine,
<lb/>For wisdom, counsel, fortune, are thine own.</q></p>

<pb n="398"/>

<p>She said the same thing to the other also
<lb/>Until the saying grew inveterate,
<lb/>And thus she made the heart of each expectant
<lb/>Of throne, wealth, host, fame, fortune. They attained,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1729"/>
<lb/>Each with a baleful tutor for his guide,
<lb/>To man’s estate, and through their mutual envy
<lb/>Both suffered, both were hot for crown and treasure,
<lb/>The whole realm and the host were rent in twain,
<lb/>While good men’s hearts grew fearful. Both the sons,
<lb/>Impassioned by their baleful tutors’ talk,
<lb/>Came to their mother, crying: <q>Which of us
<lb/>Is best and meekest under good and ill?</q>
<lb/>That prudent lady made them this reply:—
<lb/><q>First it is needful for you both to sit
<lb/>In counsel with the sages pure of heart,
<lb/>And solve this question in content and peace,
<lb/>And after do ye and your tutors ask
<lb/>The great men most renowned throughout the state,
<lb/>All those possessed of counsel as their portion,
<lb/>As to your right procedure in this case.
<lb/>Whoever seeketh crown and throne hath need
<lb/>Of wisdom, treasure, counsel, and a host,
<lb/>For when a tyrant hath the sovereignty
<lb/>He filleth all the world with heat and ruin.</q></p>

<p>Shrewd Gav made answer to his mother thus:—
<lb/><q>Seek not to parry so my questioning.
<lb/>If I am not the lustre of this realm,
<lb/>Say so, but say not aught that is untrue.
<lb/>Deliver to Talhand the throne and crown,
<lb/>And I will be a loyal liege to him,
<lb/>While if as older, wiser, and by birth
<lb/>Sprung from Jamhir, I am to be the king,
<lb/>Forbid him in his folly to attempt
<lb/>Strong measures for the sake of crown and throne.</q>
<lb/>His mother answered: <q>Act not hastily:
<lb/>Thou shouldst not push these matters to extremes.

<pb n="399"/>

<lb/>Whoever sitteth on the throne must have
<lb/>His two hands open and his girdle girt,
<lb/>Must keep his pure soul guarded too from evil,
<lb/>And walk with knowledge in the sage’s way,
<lb/>Must too be wary of the foe in fight,
<lb/>And heed what maketh for his reputation,
<lb/>The Master of the sun and moon will judge
<lb/>His acts just and unjust to state and host,
<lb/>And if the king oppresseth but a gnat
<lb/>His spirit will be left to mourn in Hell.
<lb/>The world is more obscure than night itself,
<lb/>And hearts must be more subtle than a hair
<lb/>To keep the soul and body<note>Reading with P.</note> free from evil,
<lb/>And recognise that guile will profit not.
<lb/>When one is crowned and sitteth on the throne
<lb/>Of justice all the world will joy thereat,
<lb/>Yet is his end a couch of brick and dust,
<lb/>Or else cremation in the funeral pit.
<lb/>Of such a stock as this Jamhir was sprung,
<lb/>Whose counsels were remote from deeds of ill.
<lb/>He died before his natural time to die,
<lb/>And left his younger brother as the heir
<milestone unit="calced" n="1730"/>
<lb/>To all his world. Great Mai came from Dambar,
<lb/>Still young, shrewd-hearted, and a counsellor.
<lb/>All Sandali went out to welcome him
<lb/>With full hearts and all eager for a king.
<lb/>He came and sat upon the throne of power
<lb/>With girdle girded and with open hands.
<lb/>He sought me as his spouse, and we were wedded
<lb/>That so state-secrets might be secrets still.
<lb/>Now since thou art the elder of the twain,
<lb/>The elder both in wisdom and in years,
<lb/>Strive not to vex thy spirit for the sake
<lb/>Of eminence, of treasure, and of crown.
<lb/>If I choose one of you the other one
<lb/>Will be fulfilled with pain and with revenge

<pb n="400"/>

<lb/>At me. Shed no blood for the sake of crown
<lb/>And treasure, for this Wayside Hostelry
<lb/>Abideth not with any.</q>
<lb/>When Talhand
<lb/>Had heard his mother’s words he liked them not,
<lb/>And thus replied: <q>Thy sentence is for Gav,
<lb/>Because he is the elder, but although
<lb/>My brother is mine elder as to years
<lb/>Still every elder is not better too.
<lb/>Within this host and realm is many a man
<lb/>As ancient as the vultures of the sky,
<lb/>And yet such never sought for place or host,
<lb/>Or diadem or treasure, throne or crown.
<lb/>My father died when young and did not give
<lb/>The throne of majesty to any. I see
<lb/>Thy heart in foolishness disposed toward Gav,
<lb/>And that thou wilt give him the preference,
<lb/>Though I could make as good as him from clay!
<lb/>God grant that ne’er I shame my father’s name.</q>
<lb/>His mother sware a solemn oath and said:—
<lb/><q>May I forgo the azure vault of heaven
<lb/>If ever I desired of God to make
<lb/>Gav king or ever set my heart thereon.
<lb/>Think with all charity concerning this,
<lb/>And rail not at the process of the sky,
<lb/>Because it doeth good to whom it will:
<lb/>So look to God alone and trust none other.
<lb/>I have advised you to the best I could,
<lb/>But if my counsel be of no avail
<lb/>Consider what is better and that do:
<lb/>Strive and make that the provand of your lives.</q>
<lb/>The queen thereafter summoned all the wise,
<lb/>And laid before them all that she proposed.
<lb/>She brought the keys that oped the treasury
<lb/>Belonging to those two kings wise and good,
<lb/>Displayed the wealth therein reposited

<pb n="401"/>

<lb/>Before those men of much experience,
<lb/>Gave both her sons an equal share and sought
<lb/>To satisfy the claims of both of them.
<lb/>Thereafter Gav spake to Talhand and said:—
<lb/><q>Thou, good of heart but bent on novel schemes!
<lb/>Jamhir, as thou hast heard, was greater far
<lb/>Than Mai, alike in counsel and in years.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1731"/>
<lb/>Thy sire, that virtuous and noble man,
<lb/>Showed not the least ambition for the crown.
<lb/>It was no shame to him to be a subject:
<lb/>He sought no kind of lordship o’er the lords.
<lb/>Mark if the just Judge will approve that I
<lb/>Shall gird myself before my younger brother.
<lb/>Our mother spake but justice, wherefore then
<lb/>Should thy heart joy in that which is not just?
<lb/>Now summon we the leaders of the host,
<lb/>Wise men and well acquainted with the world,
<lb/>And having listened to the sages’ words,
<lb/>Assent to their decision and advice;
<lb/>We shall learn knowledge from them and illumine
<lb/>Our hearts with understanding.</q></p>

<p>Those two sages—
<lb/>Men of good counsel—met and much talk passed.
<lb/>Gav’s sage required that Gav should be the king
<lb/>In Sandali and take the foremost place;
<lb/>The other, who was tutor to Talhand,
<lb/>And wisest of the wise, spoke up for him;
<lb/>They wrangled till the princes were at odds.
<lb/>Within one hall two thrones were set whereon
<lb/>Those princes of victorious fortune sat,
<lb/>Each with his lusty sage upon his right,
<lb/>And covetous of his inheritance.
<lb/>They summoned all the nobles to the hall,
<lb/>And seated them to right hand and to left.
<lb/>Then those two sages loosed their tongues and said:—
<lb/><q>O ye illustrious and famous men
<lb/>Of these two chiefs of glorious lineage,
<lb/>Who keep the customs of their sires in mind,
<lb/>Which will ye have as ruler over you?
<lb/>Which youth do ye esteem the holier?</q>
<lb/>The priests, the nobles, and the wise men shrewd
<lb/>Of heart, were lost in wonderment thereat.
<lb/>The two young princes sat, each on his throne,
<lb/>While those ill-omened sages both harangued,
<lb/>And citizen and soldier knew full well
<lb/>That only war and strife could come of it,
<lb/>That all the empire would be rent asunder,
<lb/>The wise man left in travail and dismay.
<lb/>Then from the company one raised his head,
<lb/>Rose to his feet, and said: <q>How dare we speak
<lb/>What profiteth before two famous kings?
<lb/>Assemble we to-morrow and discuss
<lb/>The case among ourselves without reserve,
<lb/>And then announce our sentence to them both:
<lb/>It may be that they both will be content.</q></p>

<pb n="402"/>

<p>They left the hall with murmurs and in dudgeon,
<lb/>Sighs on their lips and sorrow in their souls,
<lb/>And said: <q>This business hath grown troublesome
<lb/>Beyond the handling of experienced men.
<lb/>We never saw two kings confronted thus,
<lb/>With two bad ministers upon the dais.</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1732"/> 
<lb/>All night their faces had a careworn look,
<lb/>And when the sun arose above the mountains
<lb/>The great men of the state, the wise, assembled,
<lb/>On all sides Sandali was filled with clamour,
<lb/>And every man spake that which liked him best.
<lb/>One warrior was the partisan of Gav,
<lb/>Another for Talhand was advocate.
<lb/>Tongues tired of talking, there was no accord.
<lb/>At length that great assembly was dissolved,
<lb/>And citizens and soldiers went their ways,
<lb/>One to give in adherence to Talhand,
<lb/>And utter malisons on Gav, another
<lb/>To go to Gav with mace and sword, and cry:
<lb/><q>I will begrudge not life to serve the king.</q></p>

<pb n="403"/>

<p>Confusion filled the realm of Sandali
<lb/>Through honest partisanship. Saith the sage:
<lb/><q>When two command within one house twill fall.</q></p>

<p>Then tidings came to Gav and to Talhand:—
<lb/><q>Each quarter hath a leader of its own,
<lb/>Who layeth waste the city at his will:
<lb/>The princes must not suffer it.</q>
<lb/>The news
<lb/>Filled both of them with fear, and they kept watch
<lb/>Both night and day, and thus it came to pass,
<lb/>One day, that both young princes chanced to meet
<lb/>Without their paladins or any escort.
<lb/>They set their tongues loose, each against the other,
<lb/>Frowns on their brows and warlike thoughts within.
<lb/>The noble Gav was full of lamentation,
<lb/>The tidings moved him deeply, and he said
<lb/>Thus to Talhand: <q>My brother! act not thus,
<lb/>Because for us the thing hath passed all bounds,
<lb/>But be content and follow not mad schemes,
<lb/>For they have no allurement for the wise.
<lb/>As thou hast heard, Mai, while Jamhir still lived,
<lb/>Was as a slave before him. When he died,
<lb/>And left me still a miserable babe,
<lb/>They could give not the throne to one so young.
<lb/>The world had grown so just beneath his rule
<lb/>That no one dared to seek to fill his place.
<lb/>His brother was as body is to soul
<lb/>To him, and all wished Mai to be their king.
<lb/>If then I had been fitted for the throne
<lb/>None ever would have looked at him. Let us
<lb/>Ensue the precedents of kings of yore,
<lb/>And hear the wise on points of right and wrong.
<lb/>I am thy better both by years and father.
<pb n="404"/>
<lb/>Thou sayest: <q>I am both the chief and better.</q>
<lb/>But say not so, Seek not unworthily
<lb/>The throne of kingship, or fulfil the realm
<lb/>With strife.</q></p>

<p>
Talhand thus answered him: <q>Enough!
<lb/>None ever compassed power by subtleties.
<lb/>This crown and throne received I from my sire,
<lb/>Received it as the seed that he had sown,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1733"/>
<lb/>And henceforth I will guard the sovereignty,
<lb/>The host, and treasure, with the scimitar.
<lb/>Prate not to me of Mihr and of Jamshid:
<lb/>If thou wilt have the throne then fight for it.</q>
<lb/>They turned away with heads fulfilled with strife,
<lb/>And went within the city to prepare.
<lb/>The soldiers and the citizens all keen
<lb/>For war betook them to the princes’ courts.
<lb/>One faction was in favour of Talhand,
<lb/>The other favoured Gav. The battle-cry
<lb/>Rose at the princes’ doors. No standing-room
<lb/>Was left within the city for the throng.
<lb/>Talhand was first to arm him for the fight,
<lb/>Because his courage would brook no delay.
<lb/>He oped the portal of his father’s hoards,
<lb/>And served out helm and mail to all his troops.
<lb/>The state was rent asunder, and the wise
<lb/>Were full of fear at heart, and thus they said:—
<lb/><q>What is the end that heaven purposeth,
<lb/>And which of these young men will lose his life?</q>
<lb/>News of both kings was bruited through the realm,
<lb/>And from all sides hosts gathered troop on troop.
<lb/>Talhand was first to put his armour on,
<lb/>And bathe his hands in blood. Gav also donned
<lb/>His coat of mail and helmet, and invoked
<lb/>The spirit of his sire. Embittered thus
<lb/>They both took action, housed the elephants,
<pb n="405"/>
<lb/>And saddled them. Thou wouldst have said: <q>The earth
<lb/>Is eager for the combat.</q> All the city
<lb/>Was filled with din of gong and Indian bells,
<lb/>All ears were charged with blare of clarions.
<lb/>These two young kings departed to their camps,
<lb/>And every one took his own life in hand.
<lb/>That battlefield filled heaven with amaze,
<lb/>And eyes were darkened by the dust of hosts.
<lb/>The flourish of the trumpets and the clash
<lb/>Of brazen cymbals went up from both lines.
<lb/>The wings were drawn up to the right and left,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>Earth is all mountain-like.</q>
<lb/>The armies’ fronts extended o’er two miles.
<lb/>Those two great kings rode each his elephant.
<lb/>Their standards waved above their heads. One bore
<lb/>A tiger, one an eagle, as device.
<lb/>The footmen were in front equipped with spears
<lb/>And bucklers, and all ready for the fight.
<lb/>Gav looked upon the field and saw the air
<lb/>Streaked like the markings on a savage pard.
<lb/>Each throat <note n="1">Reading with P.</note> was full of dust, the plain all blood,
<lb/>And midst the dust the lances led the way.
<lb/>Gav, though Talhand had angered him, and wisdom
<lb/>Had stitched not up the lips of his ambition,
<lb/>Yet chose him out a man of fluent speech—
<lb/>The chiefest of his nobles—and thus said:—
<lb/><q>Go to Talhand and say to him: <q>Ensue not
<lb/>War with thy brother in this unjust fashion,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1734"/>
<lb/>Since thou wilt suffer in the other world
<lb/>For all the blood shed in this strife of ours.
<lb/>Give ear to Gav’s advice and err not thou
<lb/>Through what an evil counsellor may say.
<lb/>In this conjuncture ne’er must this reproach
<lb/>Remain as our <note n="2">Reading with P.</note> memorial—that this realm
<pb n="406"/>
<lb/>Of Hind is desolate, the lurking-place
<lb/>Of lions and of pards. Forbear this war
<lb/>And strife, and wantonly to shed this blood
<lb/>Unjustly. Joy my heart with peace and save
<lb/>Our necks by making use of wisdom’s net.
<lb/>Stretch out thy rod from this march unto Chin,
<lb/>And let whate’er thou wilt of earth be thine.
<lb/>I will esteem thy love as mine own soul,
<lb/>And set thee as a crown upon my head.
<lb/>Share we the kingship as we shared the wealth;
<lb/>Throne and tiara are not worth such pains;
<lb/>But if thus wholly thou art bent on strife,
<lb/>Injustice, and the scattering of the flock,
<lb/>Now gathered, in this world thou wilt be blamed,
<lb/>And judged in that to come. Incline not, brother!
<lb/>To wrong; it cannot stand against the right.</q></q>
<lb/>Now when the envoy came before Talhand,
<lb/>Came with the prudent embassage of Gav,
<lb/>Talhand returned this answer: <q>Say to him:—
<lb/><q>Employ not so much subterfuge in warfare.
<lb/>I call thee neither brother nor a friend;
<lb/>Thou art not, brain or skin, akin to me,
<lb/>And wilt but make the empire desolate
<lb/>By thus assailing these my gallant troops.
<lb/>The knaves are with thee and are thine Urmuzd
<lb/>Upon Bahram’s day. <note n="3">i.e., thy leaders on the day of action. Cf. Vol. iii. p. 287.</note> Thou art guilty too
<lb/>In God’s sight as ill-famed, misgot, and curst.
<lb/>For all blood shed by thee in fight henceforth
<lb/>The curses will be thine, the blessings mine.
<lb/>Thou said’st moreover: <q>Let us share the realm,
<lb/>The land, the worship, and the ivory throne,</q>

<lb/>But treasure, power, and kingship all are mine,
<lb/>Mine from the sun down to the Fish’s back. <note n="2">See Vol. i. p. 71.</note>

    <lb/>As long as thou dost play the king, dost share
    <pb n="407"/>
    <lb/>The land with me, and wouldest be my mate,
    <lb/>I wish my body and my soul may part
    <lb/>Or ever I shall look on throne and crown.
    <lb/>My host have I arrayed, and even now
    <lb/>The air is like brocade all shot with gold;
    <lb/>So many are the arrows, darts, and spearheads
    <lb/>That none can tell his stirrups from his reins.
    <lb/>Heads will I scatter on the battlefield,
    <lb/>Will bring a wail of woe from all Gav’s troops,
    <lb/>And in such fashion lead my host to fight
    <lb/>That I will sate with war that Warrior-pard.
    <lb/>I will lead Gav himself with bounden hands,
    <lb/>His troops shall see the dust of overthrow,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1735"/>
    <lb/>Their leaders shall be lifeless by my sword,
    <lb/>Their wounded men shall writhe in misery,
    <lb/>For none of them from bondslaves up to prince
    <lb/>Shall don again his breastplate for the fight.</q></q>
    <lb/>The prudent envoy having heard his answer,
    <lb/>Returned and gave it word for word. Gav’s heart
    <lb/>Was sad at hearing it because he saw
    <lb/>No knowledge in Talhand, and full of care
    <lb/>Called his own sage, discoursed of the response
    <lb/>At large, and said: <q>Suggest a remedy,
    <lb/>Thou seeker after wisdom! for this case.
    <lb/>The desert is all blood and trunkless heads,
    <lb/>And souls pass to the Judge of all the world.
    <lb/>This battle must not bring, when all is done,
    <lb/>Ill fortune on us.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>Said the sage: <q>O king!
    <lb/>Thou needest not a teacher to teach thee,
    <lb/>But if thou wilt have mine advice herein...
    <lb/>In fighting with thy brother be not fierce,
    <lb/>And send him yet another messenger,
    <lb/>A man of high rank, learned, and eloquent,
    <lb/>To give yet one more message. He still may
    <lb/>Abate hostility. Resign to him
    <pb n="408"/>
    <lb/>The treasures gathered by the toil of others,
    <lb/>Preferring thereunto thy brother’s life.
    <lb/>Since both the crown and signet-ring are thine
    <lb/>Forbear to wrangle with him as to pelf,
    <lb/>For I have seen from heaven’s processes
    <lb/>That his time endeth shortly, and that none
    <lb/>Of all the seven planets favoureth him.
    <lb/>Moreover, he will perish on this field:
    <lb/>Of strife. Thou hast no need to press him. Give him
    <lb/>Whatever he shall ask of steeds and wealth,
    <lb/>So that thou mayst repent not at his death,
    <lb/>The royal signet, crown, and throne excepted,
    <lb/>For fear the troops may call thee faint of heart;
    <lb/>But thou if king and fortune’s favourite
    <lb/>Art versed yet more in heaven’s purposes.</q>
    <lb/>The prince, when he had heard his tutor’s words,
    <lb/>Made yet a new endeavour. With wet face,
    <lb/>Through anguish for his brother’s sake, he chose
    <lb/>One favoured by the stars and eloquent,
    <lb/>And said to him: <q>Go to Talhand and say:—
    <lb/><q>Gav is fulfilled with trouble and with pain
    <lb/>As touching heaven’s purpose and this fight,
    <lb/>And prayeth that the almighty Judge of all
    <lb/>Will stir up love and prudence in thy heart,
    <lb/>So that thou mayest yet renounce this strife
    <lb/>Against thy brother. If ’tis through thy sage,
    <lb/>Who haunteth thee, deceiving thy dark soul,
    <lb/>That thou art grown so fierce and quarrelsome,
    <lb/>Still thou canst not escape the course of heaven.
    <lb/>Ask the twelve signs and seven planets how
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1736"/>
    <lb/>This unjust work will fare. Foes compass us,
    <lb/>And all the world is full of wicked men;
    <lb/>Moreover, by the monarch of Kashmir,
    <lb/>And by Faghfur of Chin, who even now
    <lb/>Are pressing on our realm, we shall be flouted
    <lb/>On two sides, and by other warrior-chiefs.

    <lb/>How they will say: <q>Why are Talhand and Gav
    <lb/>Contending for the sake of throne and crown?
    <lb/>Are they not then of common stock by birth,
    <lb/>Not each the offspring of a holy sire?
    <lb/>And yet when counsellors of evil heart
    <lb/>So prompt them they must put their hands to blood!</q>
    <lb/>If thou wilt leave thy host and visit me,
    <lb/>And so illume this darkened soul of mine,
    <lb/>I will bestow on thee dinars, brocade,
    <lb/>Steeds, treasure; I would have thee all untroubled.
    <lb/>Thou shalt have also jewels, province, signet,
    <lb/>And crown, with armlets and an ivory throne.
    <lb/>These from an elder brother are no shame,
    <lb/>And I desire not battle, but if thou
    <lb/>Wilt hearken not my rede thou wilt repent
    <lb/>At last.</q></q>
    <lb/>The envoy, speeding torrent-like,
    <lb/>Came to Talhand, the dark of soul, and told
    <lb/>What Gav had said to him and added more
    <lb/>Concerning kingship, wealth, dinars, and goods.
    <lb/>Whenas Talhand had heard the envoy’s speech,
    <lb/>His wisdom, and his prudent policy,
    <lb/>He would assent not to his brother’s words,
    <lb/>Because the heaven purposed otherwise,
    <lb/>But made this answer, saying: <q>Say to Gav:—
    <lb/><q>Be thou a schemer still, and may thy tongue
    <lb/>Be severed by the scimitar of ill,
    <lb/>Thy body burnt up in the Magians’ fire!
    <lb/>Thy crude proposals have I heard and see
    <lb/>That all thy stock-in-trade is subterfuge.
    <lb/>How wilt thou give to me the royal treasure,
    <lb/>For who art thou amongst this mighty people?
    <lb/>Good sooth! thy life must be nigh o’er since thou
    <lb/>Displayest such prolonged anxiety!
    <lb/>The armies’ ranks extend two miles, the world
    <lb/>Is full of men, of steeds, and elephants.
    <pb n="410"/>
    <lb/>March forth and set the battle in array:
    <lb/>Thou camest forth to fight; why dally then?
    <lb/>Thou'lt see such prowess from me that the stars
    <lb/>Will have to tell the total of thy days.
    <lb/>Thou knowest naught but practice, craft, and lies,
    <lb/>Perceiving that thy downfall is at hand.
    <lb/>Thou art afar from counsel, crown, and throne,
    <lb/>And no wise man will call thee fortunate.</q></q>
    <lb/>The envoy came charged with these blustering words,
    <lb/>And told the prince’s answer. Thus, until
    <lb/>Dark night displayed its face, the envoy fared
    <lb/>Between the twain who, camping on the field,
    <lb/>Dug out a trench before their several hosts.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1737"/>
    <lb/>The outposts went their rounds. Thus passed the night.
    <lb/>Now when Sol rose in Leo, making earth
    <lb/>As ’twere a sea of splendour, and, all golden,
    <lb/>Enrobed the dome of lapis-lazuli,
    <lb/>From both the camp-enclosures rose the blare
    <lb/>Of clarions and the roar of kettledrums,
    <lb/>The flags of both young princes were flapped,
    <lb/>And both the hosts deployed to right and left,
    <lb/>While at their centres those exalted princes
    <lb/>Were stationed, each with his sage minister.
    <lb/>Gav bade his to proclaim thus to the chiefs:—
    <lb/><q>Raise ye your standards, every man of you!
    <lb/>Let every one draw forth his blue steel sword,
    <lb/>But not a warrior advance a step,
    <lb/>Or any of the foot-men quit his post,
    <lb/>For none is sober, wise, and well advised,
    <lb/>That is impetuous on the day of battle:
    <lb/>I would take note of how Talhand deployeth.
    <lb/>The counsel of all-holy God alone
    <lb/>Prevaileth from bright sun to darksome dust,
    <lb/>And I am hopeful that Almighty God
    <pb n="411"/>
    <lb/>Will grant to us a glorious destiny.
    <lb/>Tried have we counsel and in loving fashion
    <lb/>Have pleaded, but Talhand is still averse.
    <lb/>If now our host shall be victorious,
    <lb/>And if the process of the sun and moon
    <lb/>Afford us fruit, shed ye not blood for spoil,
    <lb/>Because ye shall receive a treasure-hoard;
    <lb/>And if some famous warrior of our host,
    <lb/>Who chargeth on their centre, shall perchance
    <lb/>Confront Talhand in fight he must not cast
    <lb/>The dust upon him. Praying as we go,
    <lb/>And with our girdles girt, confront we now
    <lb/>Yon mighty elephants.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>The soldiers shouted:—
    <q>We will perform thy bidding and will make
    <lb/>Thy counsel the adornment of our souls.</q>
    <lb/>Upon the other side Talhand harangued
    <lb/>His troops and said: <q>Ye warders of the throne!
    <lb/>That we may be victorious, and the star
    <lb/>Of our good fortune bring forth fruit for us,
    <lb/>Draw, all of ye, your swords, confide in God,
    <lb/>And slay the foe. When ye have ta’en Gav captive
    <lb/>Ye must not kill him or address him harshly,
    <lb/>But take him from yon raging elephant,
    <lb/>And bring him to me with his hands in bonds.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>Thereat the blaring of the clarions
    <lb/>Rose in the court before the royal tent.
    <lb/>At all the neighing of the steeds, the dust
    <lb/>Raised by the chiefs, and whirl of massive maces,
    <lb/>The hills and streams re-echoed. <q>Circling heaven
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1738"/>
    <lb/>Recoileth,</q> thou hadst said. At all the shoutings,
    <lb/>And crash of axes, <q>No one,</q> thou hadst said, 
    <lb/><q>Knew head from foot.</q> The sun withdrew its skirt
    <lb/>From those bright arrow-heads and eagles’ plumes.
    <lb/>Earth seemed a sea of blood where heads and hands
    <pb n="412"/>
    <lb/>Were pebbles in its depths. The royal princes
    <lb/>Came from the centre, like huge elephants,
    <lb/>And from them both a shout arose: <q>Avoid
    <lb/>The wind of my two-headed javelin.
    <lb/>O brother! be not forward in the fight,
    <lb/>And guard thee from my sword.</q>
    <lb/>Thus shouted they,
    <lb/>Each to the other, while the earth seemed all
    <lb/>A sea of blood. The valiant swordsmen wheeled
    <lb/>About the field, and streams of blood and brains
    <lb/>Ran from the blows of those two warlike princes.
    <lb/>Thus till the sun had left the sky the strife
    <lb/>Surpassed all bounds. Then from the field a shout
    <lb/>Rose, and the voice of Gav cried: <q>Combatants,
    <lb/>And youthful warriors! exact not vengeance
    <lb/>On those that would have quarter at our hands.
    <lb/>Know that my brother shrinketh from the fray,
    <lb/>And may abide not, being left unaided.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>Then many chiefs asked quarter, many more
    <lb/>Were slaughtered on the field, Talhand’s whole host
    <lb/>Was scattered, and the flock was shepherdless,
    <lb/>The shepherd flockless. When Talhand was left
    <lb/>Alone upon his elephant, Gav called
    <lb/>To him and said: <q>Go to thy palace, brother!
    <lb/>And have regard to that and thine own court.
    <lb/>Good sooth! thou shalt not suffer in thy person
    <lb/>From me or at the hands of this famed host
    <lb/>Of swordsmen. Know that all good is from God,
    <lb/>And give Him thanks so long as life shall last 
    <lb/>That thou hast left this battlefield alive.
    <lb/>But ’tis no time for counsel or delay.</q>
    <lb/>Now when Talhand had heard his brother's words
    <lb/>He writhed with shame, his face ran tears, he left
    <lb/>The battlefield for Margh. Troops flocked to him
    <lb/>From every side. He oped his magazines,
    <lb/>And gave supplies. His host was well equipped,
    <pb n="413"/>
    <lb/>Content, and glad. He gave a robe of honour
    <lb/>To each that in his eyes so merited.
    <lb/>When all the soldiers had received their pay,
    <lb/>And when his warlike heart was freed from dudgeon,
    <lb/>He sent to Gav a message: <q>Thou that art
    <lb/>To throne as weed to garden! thou shalt burn
    <lb/>Anon, thy spirit shall be stricken, thine eyes
    <lb/>Sewn up. Thou deem’st that I can harm thee not,
    <lb/>But girdle not thy heart with self-deceit.</q>
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1739"/>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>Gav, when he heard that savage message, washed 
    <lb/>Affection for his brother from his soul.
    <lb/>His heart was filled with dudgeon, and he said
    <lb/>Thus to his sage: <q>Behold this monstrous thing!</q>
    <lb/>The sage replied: <q>O king! upon the throne
    <lb/>Thou art the memory of thy sire, more learned
    <lb/>Than seekers after lore, and mightiest
    <lb/>Of kings. I told my lord the truth, as vouched
    <lb/>By circling sun and shining moon, that till
    <lb/>This famous prince be overthrown, and snake-like
    <lb/>Writhe on the darksome dust, ne’er will he rest,
    <lb/>Or turn away from strife. In this contention
    <lb/>Thy policy is to affect delay.
    <lb/>Reply not harshly, seek the way for union
    <lb/>And peace with him. All his endeavouring
    <lb/>Is to work evil. What is he to do?
    <lb/>It is God’s will. If he shall fight again,
    <lb/>We too will fight. He is in haste while we
    <lb/>Can wait.</q>
    <lb/>King Gav then called the messenger,
    <lb/>Held talk with him at large with courteousness,
    <lb/>And said to him: <q>Go to, say to my brother:—
    <lb/><q>Be not so brutal and so violent,
    <lb/>For violence becometh not a king.
    <lb/>Thy sire was noble; thou art noble likewise.
    <lb/>I see this clearly that thou dost reject
    <lb/>My counsels and alliance, yet am fain
    <pb n="414"/>
    <lb/>To have thee fair renowned and well disposed.
    <lb/>Now will I show thee all my heart and tell
    <lb/>The matter that my mind is purposing.
    <lb/>Thine evil minister hath sundered thee
    <lb/>From quiet, good advice, and wisdom’s way.
    <lb/>Speak not but what is just because the world,
    <lb/>My brother! is but mockery and wind.
    <lb/>Incline to peace that I may send thee all
    <lb/>The wealth in full and loyal lieges also
    <lb/>Forthwith, and thy misdoubting soul will see
    <lb/>That there is naught but justice in my heart.
    <lb/>May every one be joyful in thy life!
    <lb/>My purpose is according to my words,
    <lb/>If thou, self-willed one! wilt attend thereto.
    <lb/>Howbeit if thou art intent on war,
    <lb/>And overtures for peace and pact are vain,
    <lb/>I will array my warriors for battle,
    <lb/>And they suffice to occupy a realm.
    <lb/>Let us go forth beyond these peopled lands,
    <lb/>And lead our two hosts onward to the sea.
    <lb/>Dig we a trench about them there to shut
    <lb/>Our warriors in, then fill it with sea-water,
    <lb/>And urge them to the fray, so that the worsted
    <lb/>May not escape by reason of the trench,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1740"/>
    <lb/>While he of us that is victorious
    <lb/>Shall shed not blood upon that straitened spot,
    <lb/>But take the foemen captive. God forbid
    <lb/>That we should use our scimitars and arrows.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>The envoy went his way and came like wind.
    <lb/>He told Talhand the words of Gav. The prince,
    <lb/>When he had listened to that embassage,
    <lb/>Bade summon to his presence all the men
    <lb/>Of leading in his host and seated them,
    <lb/>Each one in due accordance to his rank,
    <lb/>Repeated to them Gav's response, disclosed
    <lb/>The matter, and thus said: <q>What are your views
    <pb n="415"/>
    <lb/>On this new-fangled battle by the sea
    <lb/>Proposed by Gav? How shall we deal therewith,
    <lb/>And shall we turn his fancy into fact?
    <lb/>If ye are one with me then not a man
    <lb/>Will draw back for a moment from the fight.
    <lb/>What matter whether it be sea or mountain
    <lb/>When we seek battle in the ranks of war?
    <lb/>If ye will be my comrades in the strife
    <lb/>The leopard shall fear not the fox’s voice.
    <lb/>All those of us that seek for high renown
    <lb/>Shall win their chief ambition from the world.
    <lb/>The aspirant rather should be slain with fame
    <lb/>Than live to grace the triumph of the foe.
    <lb/>Whoe’er shall bear him stoutly in the fight,
    <lb/>His bearing shall not disadvantage him,
    <lb/>For such shall have of me unstinted wealth
    <lb/>With servants and with steeds caparisoned.
    <lb/>Then from Kashmir down to the sea of Chin
    <lb/>The folk in every state will homage us;
    <lb/>I will bestow their cities on my troops
    <lb/>Or ever kingship, crown, and throne are mine.</q>
    <lb/>In answer all the chieftains bowed their faces
    <lb/>Before him till they touched the ground, and said:—
    <q>Our choice is fame, and thou, who art our king,
    <lb/>Shalt see a turn of fortune.</q>
    <lb/>Then a shout
    <lb/>Rose from the portal of Talhand, and all
    <lb/>The province was astir with troops. He led
    <lb/>His whole host toward the sea, the troops of Gav
    <lb/>Appeared on their side, and the two kings lighted,
    <lb/>Confronting, for they each would be avenged
    <lb/>Upon the other. Round the hosts they dug
    <lb/>A trench and, when ’twas deep, let in the water.
    <lb/>Both armies drew up face to face, and foam
    <lb/>Was on the horsemen’s lips. The wings were ranged
    <lb/>To right and left, the baggage was bestowed
    <pb n="416"/>
    <lb/>Anigh the sea, and those illustrious kings,
    <lb/>All dudgeon and vindictiveness, then saddled
    <lb/>Two elephants, each at his army’s centre
    <lb/>Took up his station, and assumed command,
    <lb/>The earth grew pitch-like, heaven azure-dim
    <lb/>With all the spears and silken bannerets,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1741"/>
    <lb/>While air was ebon with the armies’ dust.
    <lb/>What with the trumpet’s blare and tymbal’s din
    <lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The sea is all a-boil,
    <lb/>The crocodiles therein call out for blood!</q>
    <lb/>While at the thud of battle-ax, of mace,
    <lb/>And sword, a red reek went up from the deep,
    <lb/>And as that veil was drawn athwart the sun
    <lb/>The world’s face vanished from the eyes of men.
    <lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The air is raining swords,
    <lb/>And planting tulips in the dust!</q> The world
    <lb/>Was heaped so with the fallen that the vulture
    <lb/>Durst fly not overhead. Some lay within
    <lb/>The trench, which ran with blood, while other some
    <lb/>Were flung down headless on the field. The sea
    <lb/>Rose with the wind, and still the hosts advanced,
    <lb/>Troop after troop, while all the plain was filled
    <lb/>With livers, brains, and hearts. The horses’ hoofs
    <lb/>Were clogged with gory mire. Talhand looked forth
    <lb/>Upon his elephant and saw the earth
    <lb/>O’erflowing like the Nile; the wind withal
    <lb/>Was in his face, and he had need of meat
    <lb/>And drink, but saw no peace and no escape
    <lb/>From wind and sun and trenchant scimitar,
    <lb/>And, swooning, died upon his golden saddle,
    <lb/>Resigning all the realm of Hind to Gav.
    <lb/>When loss betideth one, whose eyes are set
    <lb/>On gain, how great his passion and regret!
    <lb/>And since both gain and loss must pass away
    <lb/>Enjoy, old sage! the pleasures of to-day,
    <pb n="417"/>
    <lb/>For howsoever much may be thy gains
    <lb/>The world’s whole treasure is not worth the pains.
    <lb/>Gav looking from the centre failed to spy
    <lb/>The prince’s flag, so sent a cavalier
    <lb/>To wheel before the elephants, and search
    <lb/>The foemen’s front for miles, to find out whither
    <lb/>Had gone the bright red banner that had shadowed
    <lb/>The horsemen’s faces, <q>for the fight is stayed
    <lb/>Unless mine eyes are blinded by the dust.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>The horseman came, looked everywhere but saw not
    <lb/>The standard of the chief, howbeit he saw
    <lb/>The foemen’s centre all confused; cries,
    <lb/>And all the horsemen looking for their prince.
    <lb/>Thereat he turned away, came quick as dust,
    <lb/>And told the news to Gav. That general
    <lb/>Alighted from his elephant and went
    <lb/>Two miles afoot and weeping bitterly.
    <lb/>Whenas he looked upon the dead Talhand,
    <lb/>And saw the soldiers’ faces woebegone,
    <lb/>He keenly scanned the corpse from head to foot,
    <lb/>But saw not any wound on breast or skin.
    <lb/>Then that exalted monarch wailed aloud,
    <lb/>Sat grieved and heavy by the corpse, and said:—
    <q>Alack! thou youthful warrior! thou hast gone
    <lb/>Fulfilled with anguish and with wounded soul,
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1742"/>
    <lb/>Slain by the process of thine evil star,
    <lb/>Else had the cruel blast not smitten thee.
    <lb/>Thou didst reject the counsel of thy teachers,
    <lb/>Hast gone, and darkened is thy mother’s heart.
    <lb/>Much did I warn thee in all kindliness,
    <lb/>But yet my counsel could avail thee naught.</q>
</p>

<p>
    <lb/>Now when the sage of Gav arrived and saw
    <lb/>Talhand, the world-aspirant, dead, his brother
    <lb/>Bewailing him on that wide plain with cries
    <lb/>That pierced the sky, he likewise wailed and wallowed
    <pb n="418"/>
    <lb/>Before Gav, saying: <q>Woe for thee, young world-lord!</q>
    <lb/>Addressing then his lips to give advice
    <lb/>He said to Gav: <q>Exalted king! what profit
    <lb/>This grief and mourning? He hath passed away;
    <lb/>What was to be hath been. Thou mayst thank God
    <lb/>In one regard—that thy hand slew him not.
    <lb/>I told my lord all that would be as vouched
    <lb/>By Mars and Saturn, sun and moon: <q>This youth
    <lb/>Will bear him so in fight that he will end
    <lb/>His days,</q> and now his work is as the wind,
    <lb/>And he hath gone through ignorance and haste,
    
        <lb/>While all this mighty host is full of grief
        <lb/>And anger, and all eyes are fixed on thee.
        <lb/>Content thyself, make us contented too,
        <lb/>And thus contenting do what wisdom would ;
        <lb/>For when the soldiers shall behold their king
        <lb/>Afoot and weeping on the way for grief,
        <lb/>His lustre will be minished in their eyes,
        <lb/>And e’en the basest will wax insolent
        <lb/>Toward him, for the king is like a cup
        <lb/>Filled with rose-water : may the blast not strike him !</q>
        <lb/>Gav hearkened to that prudent sage’s rede.
        <lb/>A proclamation went forth from the host :—
        <lb/><q>Ye men of name and warriors of the king !
        <lb/>Let no one tarry on the battlefield,
        <lb/>For yon host is disjoined not now from this ;
        <lb/>Both must be one in act and in acclaim.
        <lb/>Be all 'neath my protection and preserve 
        <lb/>For me the memory of my high-souled brother.</q></p>
        
        <p>Then called he all the chiefs, on his eyelashes
        <lb/>Let fall his own heart’s blood, made for Talikan
        <lb/>A narrow coffin out of ivory
        <lb/>And gold, of turquoise and teak-wood, and swathed
        <lb/>His brother’s face with glossy silk of Chin.
        <lb/>Thus passed away that famous chief of Hind.
        <pb n="419"/>
        
        <lb/>They sealed the coffin-lid with gums and pitch,
        <lb/>With musk and camphor. Then Gav marched away
        <lb/>In haste and tarried at no stage for long.
        </p><p>
        <lb/>The princes’ mother slept not, rested not,
        <lb/>And fasted after they had chosen their field
        <lb/>Of battle. Ever on the road she kept
        <lb/>A watch and passed each day in bitterness.
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1743"/>
        <lb/>So when the host’s dust went up from the road
        <lb/>The wakeful watchman saw it from the look-out,
        <lb/>And thence too saw the flag of Gav appear,
        <lb/>While all the realm’s face was o’erspread with troops.
        <lb/>He gazed from two miles off in hope to see
        <lb/>The elephant and standard of Talikan,
        <lb/>But failed to recognis# them mid the host.
        <lb/>He hurried off a horseman from the look-out
        <lb/>To say: <q>The army cometh from the mountains,
        <lb/>And Gav is there with all his company,
        <lb/>But I see not Talikan, his elephant,
        <lb/>Or flag, or yet his chiefs with golden boots.</q>
        <lb/>His mother poured down blood, which drenched her breast,
        <lb/>From her eyelashes. When news came: <q>That Light
        <lb/>Of empire is bedimmed, the atheling,
        <lb/>Talhand, hath died on saddle-back and left
        <lb/>To Gav his seat upon the throne of kingship,</q>
        <lb/>She hurried to the palace of Talikan,
        <lb/>And ofttimes dashed her head against its walls.
        <lb/>She rent her raiment, tore her cheeks, flung fire
        <lb/>On hall and treasury, and burnt up all
        <lb/>The palace and the throne of majesty.
        <lb/>Thereafter she upreared a mighty pyre
        <lb/>To burn herself, as is the use of Hind,
        <lb/>And by her sorrow illustrate its Faith.
        <lb/>When tidings of his mother came to Gav
        <lb/>He urged his speedy charger on and came,
        <lb/>Embraced her closely, and entreated her,
        <pb n="420"/>
        
        <lb/>With blood upon his eyelids, saying thus :—
        <lb/><q>O loving mother ! hearken to my words,
        <lb/>Because we have transgressed not in this fight.
        <lb/>It was not I or my companions,
        <lb/>Or warrior of this noble host, that slew him.
        <lb/>None durst breathe harshly on him : he was slain
        <lb/>Beneath the process of his evil star.</q>
        <lb/>His mother answered him: <q>‘ Thou wicked man!
        <lb/>On thee will come high heaven’s malison ;
        <lb/>Thy brother hast thou slain for crown and throne,
        <lb/>And no good man will call thee fortunate.</q>
        <lb/><q>O loving mother !</q> thus he answered her,
        <lb/><q>Thou oughtest not to think such ill of me,
        <lb/>But be content and I will tell the all
        <lb/>The case of king and host and battlefield,
        <lb/>For who would dare to go to fight with him ?
        <lb/>Who ever contemplated such dispute ?
        <lb/>Now by the Judge that fashioned sun and moon,
        <lb/>Night, day, and all the process of the sky,
        <lb/>The signet-ring and throne, the steed and mace,
        <lb/>The sword and crown, shall see me never more
        <lb/>Unless I clear this matter up, and turn
        <lb/>Thy heart from harshness into tenderness,
        <lb/>By proving to thy clear soul that the hand
        <lb/>Of none hath put a period to his life.
        <lb/>What man in all the world can 'scape from death,
        <lb/>Though he be clad upon with steel and helm? —
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1744"/>
        <lb/>For when the bright lamp faileth none may count
        <lb/>Another breath however brave he be.
        <lb/>If what I prove to thee content thee not,
        <lb/>By God, the Lord of all, my purpose is
        <lb/>To burn my body in the fire and gladden
        <lb/>My foemen’s souls.</q>
        <lb/>On hearing this, his mother
        <lb/>Had ruth upon his form majestical,
        <lb/>Lest that young hero should consume in fire
        <pb n="421"/>
        
        <lb/>His body barely handselled of its soul,
        <lb/>And therefore said to him: <q>Show me the way
        <lb/>That prince Talikan died on his elephant.
        <lb/>Unless the matter be made clear to me
        <lb/>My fond heart still will burn.</q></p>
        
        <p>Gav sought his palace
        <lb/>In sorrow, summoned his experienced sage,
        <lb/>Told what had passed and how his mother’s words
        <lb/>Had angered him until he swore to burn.
        <lb/>They sat down and took counsel by themselves.
        <lb/>The sage spake thus: <q>‘ My gracious sovereign !
        <lb/>We cannot by ourselves achieve thy wish.
        <lb/>Call we the famed and wise, both old and young,
        <lb/>Among the shrewdest seekers of the way
        <lb/>From.every side—Kashmir, Dambar, Margh, M4i.</q></p>
        
        <p>Gav sent off cavaliers to every quarter,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
        <lb/>Wherever there was any sage of leading.
        <lb/>They all came to the portal of the king,
        <lb/>Came to that famous court. He held a session
        <lb/>Of wise men and of magnates learned and shrewd.
        <lb/>Gav’s sage described the battlefield and how
        <lb/>The prince and host had fought. They all conversed
        <lb/>With that sharp-witted man about the sea,
        <lb/>About the trench and letting in the water.
        <lb/>That darksome night not one among them slept,
        <lb/>But all held talk together. When the din
        <lb/>Of kettledrum ascended from the plain
        <lb/>Those men of wisdom called for ebony,
        <lb/>And two of them—ingenious councillors—
        <lb/>Constructed of that wood a board foursquare
        <lb/>To represent the trench and battlefield,
        <lb/>And with both armies drawn up face to face.
        <lb/>A hundred squares were traced upon the board,
        <lb/>So that the kings and soldiers might manœuvre.
        <lb/>Two hosts were carved of teak and ivory,
        
        <pb n="422"/>
        
        <lb/>And two proud kings with crowns and Grace divine.
        <lb/>Both horse and foot were represented there,
        <lb/>And drawn up in two ranks in war-array,
        <lb/>The steeds, the elephants, the ministers,
        <lb/>And warriors charging at the enemy,
        <lb/>All combating as is the use in war,
        <lb/>One in offence, another in defence.
        <lb/>The king was posted at the army’s centre,
        <lb/>With at one hand his loyal minister.
        <milestone unit="calced" n="1745"/>
        
            <lb/>Next to the twain were placed two elephants,
            <lb/>Supporting thrones the hue of indigo.
            <lb/>Next to the elephants two camels stood,
            <lb/>Whereon two men of holy counsel sat.
            <lb/>Next to the camels there were placed two steeds,
            <lb/>With riders valiant on the day of battle,
            <lb/>And each wing ended in a warrior-rukh,
            <lb/>His liver’s blood a-foam upon his lips.
            <lb/>The footman’s move was always to advance,
            <lb/>That he might be of aidance in the fray,
            <lb/>Till, having passed across the battlefield,
            <lb/>He sat—a minister—beside the king ;
            <lb/>The minister might quit not too in battle
            <lb/>His king by more than by a single square,
            <lb/>While o’er three squares the noble elephant
            <lb/>Could move and for two miles survey the field.
            <lb/>The camel likewise moved three squares and raged
            <lb/>And snorted on the field of fight. The horse
            <lb/>Made too a three squares’ move, but in the move
            <lb/>Alighted on a square of diverse hue.
            <lb/>The warrior-rukh might traverse every way,
            <lb/>And charge across the battle at his will.
            <lb/>They all contended in their proper lists,
            <lb/>And each observed the limits of his move.
            <lb/>When one of them beheld the king in fight,
            <lb/>Then would he shout and say: <q>Avaunt, O king !</q>
            <lb/>Whereat the king would change his square till he
            <pb n="423"/>
            <lb/>Was straitened where he stood. When rukh and horse,
            <lb/>And minister and elephant and troops,
            <lb/>Had blocked the way for him on every side
            <lb/>The king would look forth o’er that field foursquare,
            <lb/>And see his men o’erthrown, their faces lined,
            <lb/>Escape cut off by water and by trench,
            <lb/>With foes to right and left and front and rear,
            <lb/>And being moveless and fordone would die,<note>Shah mat (check mate).</note>
            <lb/>For so the process of the heaven decreed.
            <lb/>King Gav, the great and good, affected much
            <lb/>The game of chess suggested through Talhand ;
            <lb/>His mother studied it. Her heart was filled
            <lb/>With anguish for that prince. Both night and day
            <lb/>She sat possessed by passion and by pain,
            <lb/>With both her eyes intent upon the game.
            <lb/>Her whole desire and purpose centred there ;
            <lb/>Her mind was full of anguish for Talhand.
            <lb/>She kept for ever shedding tears of blood,
            <lb/>With chess to medicine her sufferings,
            <lb/>And thus she fared and neither ate nor stirred
            <lb/>Until her life had reached its period.
            <lb/>So now my tale is done that I heard told
            <lb/>With other stories of the days-of old.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><head>How Nushirwan sent Barzwi, the Leech, to Hindustan to fetch wondrous Drug, and how Barzwi brought back the Book of Kalila and Dimna</head>
<p>Mark what Shadan, son of Barzin, revealed
<lb/>A matter that till then had been concealed :—
<lb/>When Nushirwan was king of kings, and may
<lb/>His fame endure throughout eternity,
<lb/>He sought for sages learned in all lore

<milestone unit="calced" n="1746"/>

<pb n="424"/>

<lb/>To give a greater lustre to his court.
<lb/>The whole world was beneath his sovereign rule—
<lb/>The great men and the much experienced chiefs,
<lb/>The doctors, with the eloquent and brave,
<lb/>The interpreters, proved leaders, and withal<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>A famous chief, the wearer of a crown.
<lb/>This was Barzwi, the eloquent physician,
<lb/>An orator and stricken well in years,
<lb/>A man proficient in each branch of learning,
<lb/>And for each branch acclaimed throughout the world.
<lb/>One day Barzwi at audience-time drew near
<lb/>The famous king, and said: <q>O Shah, the friend
<lb/>Of knowledge, apt to seek it and retain!
<lb/>I scanned with heed an Indian scroll to-day,
<lb/>And there within ’twas written: <q>On the mountains
<lb/>Of Hind there is a herb like Raman silk,
<lb/>Which if the expert shall collect, prepare
<lb/>According unto knowledge, and then strew
<lb/>Upon the body of one dead, the corpse,
<lb/>Good sooth, forthwith will speak.</q> Now if the king
<lb/>Permit I will adventure this hard journey,
<lb/>And, with much lore to guide me on my way,
<lb/>Achieve perchance this wondrous enterprise.
<lb/>Tis fitting that the dead should come to life
<lb/>When Nushirwan is monarch of the world.</q>
<lb/>The Shah made answer: <q>‘Hardly this may be,
<lb/>But ne’er the less the endeavour should be made.
<lb/>Convey my letter thither to the Raja,
<lb/>And look upon the attractions of that land.
<lb/>Seek for a comrade in the enterprise,
<lb/>As well as wakeful fortune’s comradeship.
<lb/>Thou wilt reveal some wonder to the world,
<lb/>Because the words are enigmatical.
<lb/>Bear to the Raja worthy offerings,
<lb/>For doubtless he must furnish thee with guides.</q>

<pb n="425"/>

<lb/>Then Nushirwan unlocked his treasury,
<lb/>And of the havings that are fit for kings<note>Reading with P.</note>—
<lb/>Dinars, brocade, silks, beaver-skins, and signets,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1747"/>
<lb/>Crowns, musk, and spicery, with armlets too,
<lb/>With royal jewelry, and torques and earrings—
<lb/>He had three hundred camel-loads made ready.
<lb/>The envoy left the presence and, on reaching
<lb/>The Raja, gave the letter, and unpacked
<lb/>The bales before him, who, when he had read
<lb/>The letter of the Shah, said thus: <q>Good sir!
<lb/>Hath not my wealth been given by Nushirwan?
<lb/>Our persons, troops, and royal treasuries
<lb/>Are one. 'Twere not strange if the pious world-lord,
<lb/>By reason of his justice, throne, and Grace,
<lb/>His splendid fortune and his high achievement,
<lb/>Should raise the dead. The Brahmans on the mountains
<lb/>Are all at thy dispose. My minister,
<lb/>An idol-worshipper of high degree,
<lb/>My noble treasurer and hoarded wealth,
<lb/>With Hindustan and all its good and ill,
<lb/>And all my power o’er great and small, are thine.</q>
<lb/>They lodged the envoy with magnificence
<lb/>Hard by the Raja as his rank required,
<lb/>Providing him with provand, tapestries,
<lb/>With dainty raiment and with carpetings.
<lb/>All night the Raja held talk with the priests,
<lb/>The great men of Kannauj and with the sages,
<lb/>And when the daylight showed above the hills,
<lb/>And when the world-illuming Lamp appeared,
<lb/>He called the learned physicians and all those
<lb/>Best qualified by knowledge to advise,
<lb/>And bade them wait upon the learned Barzwi
<lb/>To hear his statement. All the erudite,
<lb/>Adept in leechcraft, went to him and, when

<pb n="426"/>

<lb/>He set forth to the mountains, fared with him.
<lb/>Barzwi roamed all the mountain-tops afoot,
<lb/>Companioned by his learned guides, and culled
<lb/>The divers herbs—the dry, the succulent,
<lb/>The withered, and the flourishing. He brayed
<lb/>Herbs succulent and dry of every kind,
<lb/>And spread them on the dead, but none revived!
<lb/>For any herb, and verily it seemed
<lb/>That all the virtue had gone out of them.
<lb/>The company roamed all the heights afoot,
<lb/>But had no fruit from travail, and Barzwi
<lb/>Then understood: <q>This task is for the King
<lb/>That liveth and that reigneth evermore.</q>
<lb/>Thoughts of the Shah, of those illustrious chiefs,
<lb/>And that long journey, moved his heart to shame.
<lb/>He thought too of the wealth that he had brought,
<lb/>And was concerned at all his senseless talk.
<lb/>He was chagrined about the scroll and said:—
<lb/><q>Why did that ignorant and stupid man
<lb/>Write in his folly and his levity
<lb/>That which produceth travail and foul words?</q></p>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1748"/> 
<lb/>Thereafter he addressed those sages thus:—
<lb/><q>Ye chiefs experienced and worshipful!
<lb/>Know ye of one more learned than yourselves,
<lb/>One eminent in every company?</q>
<lb/>The troop of sages said with one accord:—
<lb/><q>There dwelleth here a very ancient man,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Surpassing us in wisdom and in years,
<lb/>And in his knowledge besting every chief.</q>
<lb/>Thereat Barzwi said to those men of Hind:—
<lb/><q>Ye men of high renown and ardent soul!
<lb/>Exert yourselves yet more on my behalf,
<lb/>And point me out the way to him. Perchance
<lb/>That eloquent old sage may succour me
<lb/>In this affair.</q>
<lb/>They led Barzwi to him,
<lb/>Full of solicitude, with much to say.
<lb/>Now when Barzwi, that man of eloquence,
<lb/>Approached the sage and told all his own toils,
<lb/>About the writing that he had discovered,
<lb/>And of the experts’ words, the ancient sage
<lb/>Replied, informing him at large, and said:—
<lb/><q>We in those writings found the selfsame thing,
<lb/>We too were instant in the same desire.
<lb/>Now will I tell thee our discovery:
<lb/>The noble heart must hear to understand.
<lb/>The herb then is the sage, the mountain knowledge,
<lb/>As being ever distant from the throng;
<lb/>The corpse the man whose knowledge is to seek,
<lb/>Because the unwise are kill-joys everywhere.
<lb/>In sooth ’tis knowledge that doth make men live;
<lb/>Blest is the constant toiler for its sake.
<lb/>When men are stupefied through ignorance <note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Kalila<note>Being, like the sage, a teacher of knowledge.</note> is the herb, and understanding
<lb/>The mountain. In the monarch’s treasury,
<lb/>On making quest there, thou wilt find a book
<lb/>Of knowledge that will point thee out the way.</q></p>

<p>Barzwi, when he had heard, rejoiced thereat,
    <lb/>And all his travail seemed like wind to him.
    <lb/>He blessed the sage and sped back to the king,
    <lb/>Like fire. Arrived he praised the Raja, saying:—
    <lb/><q>Live thou while Hind shall last. There is a book,
    <lb/>O potent Raja! that in Indian
    <lb/>Is called Kalila.<note>Reading with P.</note> It is under seal,
    <lb/>And fondly treasured in the monarch’s hoards—
    <lb/>A guide-book both to knowledge and to counsel.
    <lb/>Kalila is the herb in mystic parlance;
    <lb/>So now, O king of Hind! be thou mine aid,
    
    <pb n="428"/>
    
    <lb/>And, if I be not troublesome, command
    <lb/>Thy treasurer to hand the book to me.</q></p>
    
    <p>The Raja’s soul was sad at that request,
    <lb/>He writhed upon his throne and answered thus
    <lb/>Barzwi: <q>No one has sought of us this thing
    <lb/>In times of yore or in these latter days.
    <lb/>However, if the world-lord Nushirwan
    <lb/>Shall ask of me my body or my soul
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1749"/>
    <lb/>I will withhold not from him aught that is
    <lb/>In being whether high or low; albeit
    <lb/>Thou shalt peruse it not save in my presence,
    <lb/>That spirits ill-disposed to me may say not
    <lb/>Within their hearts: <q>Someone hath copied it.</q>
    <lb/>So read and learn and mark it every way.</q></p>
    
    <p>Barzwi made answer thus and said: <q>O king!
    <lb/>Thou hast expressed my whole intent herein.</q>
    <lb/>The Raja’s minister then brought Kalila;
    <lb/>Barzwi perused it with a sage’s help,
    <lb/>And, as he read each chapter of the book,
    <lb/>He spent the day in learning it by heart,
    <lb/>For, having read as much as he could learn,
    <lb/>He read no further till the morrow came,
    <lb/>But, writing to the monarch of the world,
    <lb/>Sent privily a chapter of Kalila.
    <lb/>The Indians’ book by this expedient
    <lb/>Was introduced to royal Nushirwan,
    <lb/>What while Barzwi continued hale and happy,
    <lb/>By laving thus his ardent soul in knowledge,
    <lb/>Until the answer to his letters came:—
    <lb/><q>The Sea of Lore hath come to hand for us.</q>
    <lb/>Then from his palace he approached the Raja
    <lb/>To ask for leave to go. At that request
    <lb/>The Raja graciously entreated him,
    <lb/>And had prepared an Indian robe of honour—
    <lb/>Two valuable armlets and two earrings,
    <lb/>A torque of jewels worthy of a king,
    <lb/>An Indian turban and an Indian sword,
    <lb/>Whereof the blade was watered steel. Barzwi
    <lb/>Came from Kannauj, rejoicing, having gained
    <lb/>Much knowledge there. On his return to court
    <lb/>He went before the Shah and did obeisance,
    <lb/>Then told about his converse with the Raja,
    <lb/>How knowledge had been found instead of herbs.
    <lb/>The Shah replied: <q>O man approved in all!
    <lb/>Kalila hath restored my soul to life.
    <lb/>Take from my treasurer my treasury’s key,
    <lb/>And make thy choice according to thy needs.</q></p>
    
    <p>So to the treasury the sage departed,
    <lb/>But gave small trouble to the treasurer.<note>Reading with P.</note>
    <lb/>There drachms and jewels lay to left and right,
    <lb/>And yet he chose him but a royal robe,
    <lb/>Put on that costly raiment and went forth
    <lb/>Back to the court of Nushirwan in haste.
    <lb/>When he approached the throne he did obeisance,
    <lb/>And praised the king, who said: <q>O man of toils!
    <lb/>Why hast thou left the treasury and brought
    <lb/>No purses with thee and no royal gems,
    <lb/>For treasure is the meed of them that travail?</q>
    <lb/>Barzwi replied: <q>O thou whose crown Is higher
    <lb/>Than sun and moon! the wearer of king’s
    <lb/>raiment
    <lb/>Hath access to the crown and throne of alent:
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1750"/>
    <lb/>And furthermore, when people shall behold
    <lb/>Mine own unworthy self in royal robes,
    <lb/>My foes’ hearts will be strait and overcast,
    <lb/>My friends’ cheeks keep their lustre and their bloom.
    <lb/>Still there is somewhat I would ask the king
    <lb/>That I may leave my memory in the world—
    <lb/>Let Buizurjmihr, when copying the book,
    <lb/>Show favour to Barzwi’s endeavourment,
    
    <pb n="430"/>
    
    <lb/>And give account of me in Chapter One,
    <lb/>By order of the conquering king, that so,
    <lb/>When I am dead, my travailing may be
    <lb/>Forgot not by the sages in the world.</q>
    <lb/><q>A great thing this to ask!</q> the Shah replied,
    <lb/><q>And one beyond the licence of a liege,
    <lb/>And yet thy labour hath deserved as much,
    <lb/>Although thy standing warranteth it not.</q></p>
    
    <p>Then said the Shah to Buizurjmihr: <q>This wish
    <lb/>Of his is not to be ignored.</q>
    <lb/>So when
    <lb/>The fashioning of pen from kex was done
    <lb/>The scribe wrote of Barzwi in Chapter One.
    <lb/>As for the royal book which thus was writ
    <lb/>Twas in the script of bygone centuries;
    <lb/>Among the royal hoards men treasured it,
    <lb/>But ’twas beheld not by unworthy eyes.
    <lb/>It was perused not, till the people took
    <lb/>To Arabic, save in the ancient tongue;
    <lb/>But when Mamun had made earth fresh and young
    <lb/>He dealt in other fashion with the book,
    <lb/>For he had clerkly lore, was politic
    <lb/>In kingly wise, and learned in every way.
    <lb/>Twas then translated into Arabic,
    <lb/>Just as thou mayest hear it read to-day.
    <lb/>In Arabic, till Nasr was king, it stayed;
    <lb/>Then noble Abu'l Fazl, his minister
    <lb/>And, in respect to lore, his treasurer,
    <lb/>Gave orders, which were readily obeyed,<note><cit><quote xml:lang="fra">mais son pouvoir fut de courte durée</quote> <bibl>Mohl.</bibl></cit>.</note>
    <lb/>For folk to speak in Persian and Dari.<note>The more ornate Persian used at court.</note>
    <lb/>Thereafter precedent and policy
    <lb/>Conducted Nasr in wisdom’s way when he
    <lb/>Was fain by whatsoever means might be
    <lb/>To leave within the world his memory.
    
    <pb n="431"/>
    
    <lb/>They held a session with interpreters,
    <lb/>Who read the whole book out to Rudagi.<note>Rudaki in the original.</note>
    <lb/>That poet linked the scattered words in verse,
    <lb/>And threaded<note>Literally <gloss>pierced.</gloss></note> thus those pregnant pearls, that he
    <lb/>Who is a scholar might new graces find,
    <lb/>And one unlearned more facility,
    <lb/>For words in prose escape us, but combined
    <lb/>In metric guise possess the brain and mind.
    <lb/>Life to Mahmud, the world’s great potentate!
    <lb/>May earth and time as slaves before him wait,
    <lb/>How it would joy the heart if but the bad
    <lb/>From Shah Mahmud less free allowance had!
    <lb/>Yet be not thou concerned thereat. Anon,
    <lb/>Since life is far advanced, thou must be gone.
    <milestone unit="calced" n="1751"/>
    <lb/>Thou hast thine ups and downs from day to day,
    <lb/>At whiles assistance and at whiles dismay;
    <lb/>But neither of them will for aye remain
    <lb/>With thee; the hope of tarriance here is vain.
