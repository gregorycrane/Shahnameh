<div><head>XXXV BAHRAM GUR: HE REIGNED SIXTY-THREE YEARS</head>
<pb n="3"/>




<div>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Bahram’s accession and inaugural measures. His adventures, amorous and otherwise, among his subjects. His relations with foreign potentates. His instructions to his officials, and remission of taxation. His introduction of the Gypsies into Iran, and his death.</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>NOTE</head>
<p>Bahram Gur (Varahran V., A.D. 420-438) is said by Tabari and Mas'udi to have been twenty years old at the time of his accession.<note place="foot">NT, p. 98; MM, ii. 190.</note> 

According to Tabari he reigned either eighteen or twenty-three years.<note place="foot">NT, p. 112.</note> Mas'udi says the latter.<note place="foot">MM, id.</note> On the other hand, Mir Khand, who tells us that he followed the most generally received account, perhaps Firdausi’s own, states that Bahram reigned sixty-three years.<note>RM, Pt. I, Vol. ii. p. 362.</note> No doubt, popular tradition lovingly prolonged to the utmost the reign of this Shah who, like James V. of Scotland, was <quote>King of the Commons.</quote> The poet was at no loss for material in this part of his work, and the reign is the most diverting in the Shahnameh. Its interest with regard to the question of the provenance of the Arabian Nights has been noted already.<note place="foot">See Vol. vi. p. 250.</note> As is to be expected in the circumstances, the subject-matter is largely legendary, though some authentic features have been preserved, and there can be little doubt but that Bahram’s own character as depicted by Firdausi is in the main historically correct. He fulfilled the promises made by him when a candidate for the throne.</p>


<pb n="4"/>

<p>but gave himself up largely to pleasure, though this does not seem
to have impaired his activities at critical moments. He appears, too,
to have been fortunate in his administrators. His chief minister,
Mihr Narsi, who is not to be confounded with Narsi, the Shah’s
brother, and three of his sons were at the head of affairs. One
was the principal, or nearly so, of the official hierarchy, another
was chief superintendent of the taxes, and the third was commander-in-chief.<note n="1">NT, pp. 106, 108 seq.</note> Mihr Narsi and his father Burdza are stated to
have held office under Yazdagird, Bahram’s father, and the former
was reappointed chief minister when Yazdagird, Bahram’s son,
came to the throne.<note n="2">ZT, ii. pp. 122, 127; NT, pp. 113.</note> He was himself a prince and an Arsacid, so
it would seem that the supplanted family had regained a great
position for itself under the new dispensation, and that the state of
things fully justified the pronouncement put by later legend into
the mouth of Kaid.<note n="3">See Vol. vi. pp. 256, 267.</note> Bahram Gur began his reign with a persecution
of the Christians, which led to war with the Eastern Roman
Empire. There is a slight allusion to such a war in the poem,<note n="4">See p. 84.</note> but
the chief incident recorded to have taken place is a pacific one.<note n="5">See p. 100 seq.</note>
§§ 1 and 2. Bahram devotes the first days of his reign to
carrying out his promises of reform made before his accession,<note n="6">See Vol. vi. p. 406.</note>
and to the relief of taxation.
§§ 3-16. We have here a series of popular legends of Bahram’s
adventures when going about unrecognised among various classes
of his subjects. The story of the miser occurs twice.<note n="7">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note><note n="8">§§ 4 and 15 seg.</note>
§§ 19-22. We have here the story of Bahram’s most famous
exploit, which is historical, though as much cannot be said of the
various details with which popular appreciation has embellished it.
Historically, the foes over whom Bahram won his great triumph
were the Haitalians, or White Huns.<note n="9">See Vol. i. p. 19.</note> This is clear on Firdausi’s
own showing when he comes to the reign of Piruz.<note n="10">See p. 164 seq.</note> Later on
again, in the reign of Nushirwan, ample distinction is made
between the subjects of the Khan of Chin and the Haitalians,<note n="11">See p. 328 seg.</note>
In substituting the former for the latter on this occasion Firdausi
errs in good company, Tabari, Mas'udi, and Mir Khand all name
the Turks as the enemy,<note n="12">NT, p. 99; MM, ii. 190; RM, Pt. I., Vol. ii. p. 357.</note> and since they did not come upon the
scene for another century and more,<note n="13">See Vol. i. p. 20.</note> we learn approximately the


<pb n="5"/> 
earliest date at which the story of Bahram’s exploit could have been edited in its existing form. According to the Persian Tabari<note n="1">ZT, ii. 120.</note> —the version adapted from the original Arabic by Bal’ami, the minister of the Samanid prince Mansur, son of Nuh (a.p. 961-976), about a.p. 963—the Khan was put to flight, according to the Arabic<note n="2">NT, p. 101.</note> slain in the battle by Bahram’s own hand. Both agree that the Khatun, or wife of the Khan, was taken prisoner and sent to serve in the famous Fire-temple at Shiz, whither Bahram had gone to pray for success in his expedition.<note n="3">See p. 86; ZT, ii. 121; NT, 104.</note> According to the Arabic Tabari, Bahram, as an act of thanksgiving for his victory, relieved his subjects of taxation for three years.<note n="4">NT, 105.</note> This probably is the popular version of the fact that great reforms in that connexion were effected during his reign, but they could not have been justified, one would think, to the extent stated by the amount of plunder taken from the Haitalians, and still less to the extent described in the Shahnama, which affirms that he almost reformed taxation away altogether. It may be added that the various accounts of Bahram’s expedition against the Haitalians are in substantial accord though they differ in detail, e.g., as to how far the enemy had advanced at the time of the battle, the route that Bahram followed in his march, and the number of troops that he took with him.
</p>

<p> §24. Bahram’s war with the Eastern Roman Empire, in which he was not very successful, came to an end in a.p. 422, but Firdausi (§ 19) makes it synchronise with that against the Haitalians which, according to the Persian Tabari,<note n="5">ZT, ii. 119.</note> took place five years later. Next we hear of an envoy sent by Caesar (§§ 19, 23), and then of his belated audience with the Shah. The points discussed are not the terms of peace, but certain “hard questions,”<note n="6">As to which see p. 102 seq.</note> and it is only incidentally that the envoy mentions that Rum is ready to pay tribute to Iran. We have a similar case in the reign of Nushirwan when the Raja of Hind sends the game of chess to that Shah, who returns the compliment with the game of nard,<note n="7">See p. 384 seq.</note> while in the next volume we shall find the disgraced counsellor Buzurjmihr regaining the favour of the same Shah by his success in solving another problem set by Caesar. §§ 26-38. For instances in the Shahnama of kings going incognito to visit foreign courts, see Vol. vi. pp. 325, 335. In the Arabic Tabari, Bahram’s motive for visiting Hind is to see whether by annexing a portion of it he could lighten the taxes of his own


<pb n="6"/>
subjects.<note n="1">NT, p. 106.</note> Unlike his expedition against the Khan of Chin, as Firdausi puts it, and historically against the Haitalians, the one to Hind appears to be wholly fabulous. It is given, however, at length by Tabari and Mir Khand, and mentioned by Mas’udi.<note n="2">Id. RM, I, ii. 360; MM, ii. 191.</note> It will be seen that Bahram in the course of his well-meant efforts to promote the welfare of his subjects does not find it quite so easy as he expected to make everybody happy by legislation. 
</p><p>
§39. Professor Noldeke is inclined to consider Bahram’s importation of Gypsies from Hind to Iran historical.<note n="3">NT, p. 99 note.</note> The details of course belong to the province of popular legend, but are delightfully characteristic of both parties concerned. The Gypsy language appears to be a debased form of Hindustani. According to Mir Khand the Gypsies intermarried with the Persians, and the Jats were said to be their offspring. Consequently, nearly every Jat is a  musician.<note n="4">RM, I, ii. 357.</note>
</p>

<p>§40. Firdausi is almost alone in his statement that Bahram Gur died in his bed. The common account is that he was killed when out hunting by falling into one of the underground water-courses, so common in Persia, and that his body never was recovered. Popular tradition places the scene of his death in a valley between Shiraz and Isfahan and known as the “Vale of Heroes,” where there are numerous springs supposed to be intercommunicating and of great depth. Sir John Malcolm states that one of his escort was drowned in 1810 when bathing in the identical spring in which Bahram is said to have perished.<note n="5">MHP, i. 94 and note.</note> Tabari lays the scene of the accident in Media, and it took place, if it took place at all, probably not far from Hamadan at a spot called, according to Dinawari, Dih Marj. Noldeke, however, considers that the whole story was made up to account for the nickname “Gur” bestowed upon Bahram. The word in question means both “onager” and “tomb.”<note n="6">NT, 103 and note.</note> The same collocation of letters also means a “Fire-worshipper,” and it is possible that some Muhammadan translator from the Pahlavi may have thought fit to dispatch the guebre to the grave.

<head>§ 1 How Bahram ascended the Throne, charged the Officers, and wrote Letters to all the Chiefs</head>
<p>
<lb/>Whenas Bahram Gur sat upon the throne
<lb/>The sun acclaimed him while the Shah adored
<lb/>The Maker—the all-seeing, watchful World-lord,
<lb/>The Lord of victory and majesty,
<lb/>The Lord of increase and of loss—then said:<q>From Him have I received the throne and crown,
<lb/>For He hath fashioned fortune, and my hopes
<lb/>And fears are all in Him. I give Him thanks
<lb/>For all His benefits; do ye too praise Him,
<lb/>And strive to keep His covenant unbroken.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Iranians answered:<q>We are girt for service.
<lb/>May this crown prove right glorious to the Shah,
<lb/>And may his heart and fortune live forever.</q>
<lb/>Their praises done, all scattered gems before him.
<lb/>Thus said Bahram:<q>O chiefs experienced
<lb/>In daily good and ill! we all are slaves,
<lb/>And God is One, sole-worthy to be worshipped.
<lb/>From fear of evil days we will secure you,
<lb/>And not expose you to malignant Need.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spoke. They rose and homaged him anew.
<lb/>They spent the night in converse, and at sunrise
<lb/>The Shah sat peacefully upon his throne,
<lb/>The Iranians came to audience, and he said:<q>Ye chieftains famed and favored by the stars!
<lb/>Put we our trust in God and joy in Him,
<lb/>Boast not and root out of the world our hearts.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spoke and then those Glories of his court—
<lb/>His chiefs—called for their steeds. The Shah, the third day,
<lb/>Sat on the throne, and said:<q>Religious usage

<pb n="8"/>

<lb/>Must be observed. We witness to God's being,
<lb/>And make our souls familiar with the Faith.
<lb/>There is a Resurrection, Heaven, and Hell,
<lb/>And we cannot escape from good and ill.
<lb/>Ascribe not Faith or knowledge to the man
<lb/>That doubteth of the Day of Reckoning.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The fourth day, donning on the ivory throne
<lb/>The well-loved crown, he said:<q>Men, not my treasures,
<lb/>Are my delight. This Wayside Inn I ask not,
<lb/>And grudge not going, for the other world
<lb/>Is everlasting and this transitory.
<lb/>Abstain from greed and trouble not thyself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The fifth day he said thus:<q>I have no joy
<lb/>In others' toils for mine aggrandizement;
<lb/>We toil in quest of jocund Paradise;
<lb/>He that hath sown but seed of good is blest.</q>
<lb/>The sixth day said he to his subjects:<q>Never
<lb/>May we ensue defeat; we will protect
<lb/>Our troops from foes and make malignants tremble.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The seventh day, when he took his seat, he said:<q>Ye chiefs wise, wary, and experienced!
<lb/>Since with the vile we practise villainy
<lb/>We will have conversation with the wise.
<lb/>Ye that are cold to me shall fare still worse
<lb/>Than with my sire, but ye that do my will
<lb/>Must not experience sorrow, pain, and toil.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The eighth day, when he took his seat, he bade
<lb/>Call Jawan of those about the court,
<lb/>And said to him:<q>To every mighty man,
<lb/>To every chief and clime, indite for me
<lb/>A letter couched in just and loving terms,
<lb/>And say: 'Bahram hath mounted on the throne
<lb/>With joy—a lord of bounty and of right,
<lb/>A shunner of all fraud and knavery—</q></p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>
<lb/>For he hath Grace and stature, love and justice:
<lb/>The Judge all-holy is in all his thoughts.
<lb/><q>'I will accept,' he saith, 'the obedient,
<lb/>But fault-condoning maketh faults increase.
<lb/>I sit upon my glorious father's throne,
<lb/>I keep the customs of just Tahmuras,<note n="1">For Tahmuras see Vol. i. p. 125.</note>
<lb/>And treat all justly howsoe'er perverse.
<lb/>I will be juster than mine ancestors,
<lb/>And guide you to the Faith—that of Zarduhsht,
<lb/>The prophet—quitting not my fathers' path.
<lb/>I put the Faith of old Zarduhsht before me;
<lb/>The way of that true prophet is mine own.
<lb/>Be ye all sovereign in your own affairs,
<lb/>And guard your marches and your loyalty,
<lb/>Kings of your children and your women-folk:
<lb/>Blest is the man that is both wise and pure.
<lb/>If God accord us life and favouring stars
<lb/>We will not fill our treasury with gold;
<lb/>Such treasures keep the poor in travail. Read
<lb/>This joyful letter which assureth you
<lb/>Of lasting wealth and honour. To all kings
<lb/>Our greeting, most to those whose warp and woof
<lb/>Are love.''</q>
<lb/>They sealed the letters and made choice
<lb/>Of glorious envoys. Archmage, man of lore,
<lb/>And wary cavalier, those letters bore.</p>

<head>§ 2 How Bahram pardoned the Fault of the Iranians, farewelled Munzir and Numan, and remitted the Iranians' Arrears of Taxes</head>
<p>
<lb/>Next day when Sol rose, when the hills bulked large,
<lb/>And sleep was broken, to Munzir there came
</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1490"/>
<p>
<lb/>A panic-stricken throng and said to him —
<lb/><q><lb/>“Make intercession for us with the Shah
<lb/>To pardon our offences, for the crimes
<lb/>Of Yazdagird so wrought us that the blood
<lb/>Froze in the nobles’ hearts! So much of foul
<lb/>In word and deed, iniquity, distress,
<lb/>And anguish chilled our hearts toward Bahram
<lb/>Because we suffered so beneath his sire.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Munzir’s warm pleadings mollified the Shah,
<lb/>Who being just and noble pardoned all,
<lb/>Whate’er the fault. He decked the imperial palace,
<lb/>And all the good and great resorted thither.
<lb/>When they had got the place of majesty
<lb/>In readiness they seated there the worthy,
<lb/>In every place they spread the board and called
<lb/>For wine and harp and minstrelsy. Next day
<lb/>Another crowd assembled, yet the chief
<lb/>Was wearied not of giving. On the third
<lb/>There were both revels and festivities,
<lb/>And grief was banished from the world-king’s palace.
<lb/>He told the offices done by Nu’man
<lb/>And by Munzir—those men of stainless birth—
<lb/>On his behalf, and all the chiefs acclaimed
<lb/>Those desert dwellings and those men of war.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah next oped his treasury and filled
<lb/>His palace with brocade and gold, steeds, trappings,
<lb/>Mail-coats and scents,<note>Reading with P.</note> and gems of every hue.
<lb/>He gave all to Nu’man and to Munzir,
<lb/>And Jawanwi told o’er to them the gifts.
<lb/>None matched the Shah in bounty and in travail.
<lb/>He gave the other Arabs many presents,
<lb/>So that they left the royal halls, rejoicing.
<lb/>He then had brought a royal robe of honor,
<lb/>A steed, and raiment of a paladin;
<lb/>These gave they to Khusrau, made much of him,
</p>

<pb n="11"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1491"/>

<p>
<lb/>And seated him upon the glorious throne.
<lb/>Then, turning from Khusrau,<note>Reading with P.</note> the king of kings,
<lb/>Descending from his throne, approached the seat
<lb/>Where sat Narsi—a prince, his younger brother,
<lb/>And one with him in heart and tongue. He made
<lb/>Narsi the captain of the host to set
<lb/>The land in order, gave up to his keeping
<lb/>The host at large, and ravished all the realm
<lb/>With bounty, oped the treasury, and paid
<lb/>The troops who gladdened with dinars. The Shah,
<lb/>That man of lore, then bade Gushasp, the scribe,
<lb/>With prudent Jawanwi, the chief accountant,
<lb/>Approach, and ordered them to cancel all
<lb/>Arrears of taxes for the Iranians.

<lb/>These two wise scribes went to their registers,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1491"/>
<lb/>And in this matter called in aid Kaiwan
<lb/>Because he was the expert of the day,
<lb/>And kept the world’s statistics in his breast.
<lb/>They added up the sum of the arrears,
<lb/>And found it ninety and a hundred times
<lb/>Three hundred thousand drachms. These he forgave,
<lb/>And burnt the registers, and all Iran
<lb/>Rejoiced thereat. Whenas all folk were aware
<lb/>Of that event they praised him mightily.
<lb/>They all flocked to the Fire-temples, to the halls
<lb/>Where New Year’s Day and Sada feast were kept,
<lb/>Flung musk upon the Fire and blessed Bahram,
<lb/>The Shah. Thereafter he dispatched officials
<lb/>To go about the world. He sought and gathered
<lb/>Within a certain city all the exiles
<lb/>Of Yazdagird that thus the monarch’s letter
<lb/>Might reach those noble Persians, and inquire
<lb/>Their wishes, sent each chief a robe of honor,
<lb/>And gave to each a province that befitted
<lb/>His station. Noble, archimage, and marchlord,
</p>

<pb n="12"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1492"/>

<p>
<lb/>Whoever heard Bahram’s deliverance,
<lb/>All visited his court with open hearts,
<lb/>And blithe of countenance. He bade each suitor
<lb/>Repair to the high priest and, when the world
<lb/>Had recognised his bidding, he let stand
<lb/>A herald at his gate thus to proclaim:—
<lb/><q><lb/>"Ye subjects of the watchful Shah! abstain
<lb/>From sorrow and from sin, and praise henceforth
<lb/>Him through whose justice earth is prosperous.
<lb/>Take refuge from the world with God alone,
<lb/>For He possesseth all and helpeth all.
<lb/>The man that giveth heed to our command,
<lb/>Not turning from our path and fealty,
<lb/>To him will we increase our benefits,
<lb/>And clear our mind of hate and covetise;
<lb/>But whosoever shunneth what is just
<lb/>Shall suffer retribution at our hands.
<lb/>If God hereafter shall vouchsafe us strength,
<lb/>And matters turn out to our heart’s content,
<lb/>We will add benefit to benefit,
<lb/>And ye shall utter praise on our account."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>At these words all the people of Iran
<lb/>Went full of joy and bright of countenance,
<lb/>And, as the sovereignty became secure,
<lb/>Joy waxed and sorrow minished, while the Shah
<lb/>In feasting, horsemanship upon the Ground,
<lb/>In sport and polo, full employment found.
</p>

<div>
<head>§ 3 How Bahram went to the House of Lambak, the Water-carrier, and became his Guest</head>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1492"/>
<lb/>It happened that Bahram Gur went one day
<lb/>With certain warriors to hunt the lion.

<pb n="13"/>
<lb/>An old man, staff in hand, drew near to him,
<lb/>And said: <q>God-fearing Shah! within our city
<lb/>There are two men, one rich, the other poor.
<lb/>Now Barahem, the Jew, a miscreant knave,
<lb/>Is rich in silver and in gold. Lambak,
<lb/>The water-carrier, is of noble nature,
<lb/>Fair-spoken, hospitable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So Bahram
<lb/>Inquired about the two, their words and ways.
<lb/>A worthy said: <q>Lambak, the water-carrier,
<lb/>O great, famed, noble king! is generous,
<lb/>Doth keep a table, and is well disposed.
<lb/>He passeth half the day in water-carrying,
<lb/>The other half in entertaining guests,
<lb/>And leaveth nothing over for the morrow,
<lb/>While Barahem is but a barren Jew,
<lb/>And grasping, and his greed should be exposed.
<lb/>He hath drachms, treasure, and dinars, brocades,
<lb/>And goods of all kinds, but none seeth his bread,
<lb/>And he is ever wrathful at a guest.</q>
<lb/>The Shah then bade a herald: <q>Go, proclaim
<lb/>Before the court: 'To everyone concerned:
<lb/>The water of the water-carrier,
<lb/>Lambak, is bad to drink.'</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He stayed till Sol
<lb/>Grew pale, then mounted a fleet steed and came,
<lb/>Like wind, toward the dwelling of Lambak,
<lb/>Knocked with the ring against the door, and cried:
<lb/><q>A captain of the Iranian host am I,
<lb/>The night is dark, and I have far to go.
<lb/>Let me lodge here tonight. I will behave
<lb/>With honour and discretion.</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>Then Lambak,
<lb/>Pleased with the voice of one that spake so fairly,
<lb/>Made answer straight: <q>Come in, O cavalier!
<pb n="14"/>
<lb/>And may the king approve thee. If ten others
<lb/>Were with thee it were better; each had been
<lb/>A moon above my head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Shah Bahram
<lb/>Dismounted, and Lambak saw to the steed.
<lb/>He gladly rubbed it down and haltered it,
<lb/>Then, when Bahram was seated, ran and brought
<lb/>A chess-board<note>According to the poet’s own showing later on, cheas was not intro
duced into Persia till the reign of Nushirwan. See p. 384 seq.</note> and made shift to furnish food,
<lb/>And all things needful, saying: <q>Noble sir!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1493"/> 
<lb/>Put by the chess-men and begin thy meal.</q> <note n="2">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The eating done, the host in high delight
<lb/>Brought out a cup of wine. The Shah was all
<lb/>Amazement at that feast of his, kind speech,
<lb/>And cheery mien, passed night there, and at dawn
<lb/>Woke at the salutation of Lambak,
<lb/>Who said: <q>Thy steed, good sooth, fared ill last night.
<lb/>Stay just this one day with me, and if thou
<lb/>Wouldst have a comrade we will summon one,
<lb/>And find the needful. Joy with me one day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king made answer to the water-carrier:
<lb/><q>I have not much on hand today.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Lambak
<lb/>Departed, taking divers water-skins,
<lb/>But nobody appeared to buy his water.
<lb/>In dudgeon he put off his vest and, taking
<lb/>His porter’s knot and bucket in his arms,
<lb/>Went and procured instead at the bazar
<lb/>Meat and dried curds, and in due course put on
<lb/>The pot. His guest took note of all his trouble.
<lb/>Lambak prepared the meal; they ate and drank,
<lb/>And had another sitting. All that night
<lb/>Bahram had wine in hand; Lambak too loved it.
</p>

<pb n="15"/>
<p>
<lb/>When it was day he hurried to Bahram,
<lb/>And said: <q>Be merry night and day, and free
<lb/>From trouble, grief, and toil. Consort with me
<lb/>For yet another day, for, know, thy presence
<lb/>Is life and goods to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“Now God forbid
<lb/>That we should not be happy for a third day,”
<lb/>Bahram said, while the water-carrier blessed him:
<lb/><q>Be merry in thy heart and mate with fortune.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He took to the bazar his water-skins
<lb/>And tackle, which he pledged to some rich man,
<lb/>Bought what he needed and returned in haste
<lb/>Rejoicing to Bahram, and said to him:
<lb/><q>Help with the food, for man must eat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram
<lb/>Took the meat promptly from him, cut it up,
<lb/>And then proceeded with the cookery.
<lb/>When they had eaten they took wine and goblet,
<lb/>And first of all drank to the king of kings.
<lb/>Lambak, when they had drunk, prepared for sleep,
<lb/>And set a candle by Bahram Gur’s couch.

<lb/>The fourth day, when the sun shone and Bahram Gur
<lb/>Awoke, his host approached and said: <q>Famed sir!
<lb/>Thou hast resided in this small, dark house,
<lb/>And doubtless in discomfort; still if thou
<milestone unit="calced" n="1494"/>
<lb/>Fear’st not the Shah stay in my mean abode
<lb/>Two se’nnights more if so thou hast a mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Shah Bahram blessed him and said: <q>Live thou
<lb/>Thy years and months in mirth and happiness.
<lb/>We have been jolly in this house three days,
<lb/>While quaffing to the monarchs of the world,
<lb/>And elsewhere I will speak a word for thee
<lb/>That shall make bright thy heart and plans, for sure
<lb/>Thy hospitality shall yield thee fruit,
<lb/>And, if thou perseverest, thrones and crowns.</q>
</p>
<pb n="16"/>
<p>
<lb/>Dust-swift he put the saddle on his steed,
<lb/>Departed merrily and sought the chase.
<lb/>He hunted on till night the hills ’gan ride,
<lb/>Then lightly from his meiny turned aside.
</p>
</div>
<head>§ 4 How Bahram went to the House of Baraham, the Jew, who treated him 
scurvily</head>
<div>
<p>
<lb/>He stole away and made toward the house
<lb/>Of barren Baraham, knocked at the door,
<lb/>And said: <q>The Shah hath come back from the chase,
<lb/>But I was left behind. ’Tis night and I
<lb/>Know not the way, can find not Shah and escort.
<lb/>If I may sojourn in this house tonight
<lb/>I will not trouble any one.</q>
<lb/>A slave
<lb/>Went and reported this to Baraham,
<lb/>Who answered: <q>Trouble not thyself hereat,
<lb/>But say: ‘Thou wilt not get a lodging here.’</q>
<lb/>The messenger departed to Bahram Gur,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is no shelter here for thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>Return to him and say:
<lb/>‘I mean to stop. I ask thee for a lodging
<lb/>Tonight and I will trouble thee no further.’</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The servant, hearing this, ran back and said:
<lb/><q>This horseman will not budge tonight and saith
<lb/>As much in many words.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Baraham:
<lb/><q>Go instantly and say: ‘This house is small.
<lb/>The Jew is very poor and every night
<lb/>Reposes, bare and hungry, on the ground.’</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They gave the message, and Bahram Gur said:
<pb n="17"/>
<lb/><q>If here my lodging will prove troublesome
<lb/>I will not enter but will sleep outside
<lb/>The door, ’tis all I want.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Baraham:
<lb/><q>Brave horseman! thoughtlessly<note>Or "grievously."</note> thou troublest me.
<lb/>Were any one to rob thee in thy sleep
<lb/>I should be plagued enough on thine account.
<lb/>Come in if thou art in distress and want,
<lb/>But on condition that thou askest naught.
<lb/>I have not e’en a napkin wherewithal
<lb/>To wipe my body when ’tis washed at death,
<lb/>Or shroud wherein to wind it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram rejoined: <q>I will not trouble thee
<lb/>In any way. Thy portal will suffice.
<lb/>I will be watchman, barring bell and cry.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then Baraham was troubled, and his soul
<lb/>A brake of cares. He thought: <q>This saucy fellow
<lb/>Will not depart. How can I cause him trouble
<lb/>About his steed?</q> then said again: <q>Great sir!
<lb/>Thy many words afflict me. If thy steed
<lb/>Shall leave its droppings here and stale or break
<lb/>The tiles, thou shalt remove its dung at dawn,
<lb/>Sweep up, bear off its refuse to the plain,
<lb/>And pay for any breakages at once.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>I pledge my head to this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Dismounting from his steed he tethered it
<lb/>With its own bridle and unsheathed his sword.
<lb/>He spread his saddle-cloth, used as his pillow
<lb/>The saddle, and reposed upon the floor.
<lb/>The Jew secured the door, brought victuals forth,
<lb/>And sat him down to eat. <q>O cavalier!</q>

<lb/>He said, <q>remember, having heard, this saw:
<lb/><q>Who hath may eat and who hath not look on.</q></q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>I have heard so from of old,</q>






<pb n="18"/>
<lb/>And now I have beheld made manifest
<lb/>What thou hast quoted from a sage’s words.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Jew brought wine forth and, when satiate
<lb/>With food and blither for the drinking, bawled:
<lb/><q>O toilful horseman! list this ancient saw:
<lb/>‘He that hath food and purposeth to eat
<lb/>Will offer his thanksgiving for the meat,
<lb/>For one of substance hath a happy mind,
<lb/>And in his wealth a coat of mail will find;
<lb/>But Empty Pockets is a dry-lipped wight,
<lb/>And, like thee, ravenous at mid of night.’</q>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>’Tis passing wonderful
<lb/>What I have seen, and must not be forgotten,
<lb/>And if thy goblet give thee good at last
<lb/>Then heigh for drinker, wine, and genial cup!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When o’er the mountains Sol displayed its sword
<lb/>Bahram Gur shunned more sleep and put the saddle
<lb/>On his fleet grey. His saddle! Nay, hard pillow.
<lb/>Came Baraham and said: <q>O cavalier!
<lb/>Thou art not faithful to thy word. Thou saidst:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1496"/>
<lb/>‘I will sweep up the droppings of the steed
<lb/>At once.’ Away with them as thou didst promise.
<lb/>I am annoyed by a dishonest guest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur answered: <q>Go and fetch a slave.
<lb/>He will remove the droppings fast enough,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>And I will give him gold for sweeping up,
<lb/>And bearing off, the refuse to the plain.</q>
<lb/><q>No one have I,</q> he said, <q>to sweep up refuse,
<lb/>Take it away, and fling it in the ditch.
<lb/>Break not thy promises deceitfully;
<lb/>Let me not say that thou hast played the knave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, hearing, took another course.
<lb/>He had a dainty handkerchief of silk
<lb/>Inside his boot, all musk and spicery;
<lb/>He took it out and put therein the droppings,
<pb n="19"/>
<lb/>Then flung them all together in the ditch.
<lb/>Away went Baraham and snatched it up
<lb/>While Shah Bahram stood dazed. <q>Oho!</q> said he,
<lb/><q>Thou scrupulous! If the great king shall hear
<lb/>Of all thy nobleness he will secure thee
<lb/>From want in this world, and will set thee high
<lb/>Among the chiefs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He went back to his palace,
<lb/>And all night long was planning what to do.
<lb/>Within his halls thought banished all repose,
<lb/>He laughed himself but kept the matter close.
</p>

<head>§ 5 How Bahram bestowed the Wealth of Bardham upon Lambak</head>

<div>
<p>
<lb/>Next morn he donned his crown and held an audience,
<lb/>Then called to him Lambak, the water-carrier,
<lb/>Who came before him with enfolded arms.
<lb/>They brought withal and quickly Baraham,
<lb/>That curst, malicious Jew. When he arrived
<lb/>They made him sit and called an honest man,
<lb/>To whom the Shah said: <q>Take some baggage-beasts
<lb/>And, acting with the utmost honesty,
<lb/>Go to the house of Baraham forthwith,
<lb/>And look thou bring what thou find’st hoarded there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That honest man went to the Jew’s abode.
<lb/>The house was all brocade, dinars, and raiment,
<lb/>All carpetings, and draperies, and hoards.
<lb/>There was a caravanserai attached,
<lb/>And no room too on earth for all the goods—
<lb/>Gold, silver, every gem, and, on the top
<lb/>Of every bag, a lofty diadem.
<pb n="20"/>

<lb/>The archmage’s reckoning failed. He called for camels,


<lb/>A thousand from the desert of Jahram,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1497"/>
<lb/>And packed the baggage but much still remained.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>That good man drove apace the caravans,
<lb/>And, when the bells resounded from the court-gate,
<lb/>Went and informed the Shah: <q>As many gems
<lb/>Are here as in thy treasury, yet are left
<lb/>Two hundred ass-loads!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thought the Shah, amazed: <q>The Jew hath greatly toiled, but to what profit
<lb/>Since food hath failed him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Bestowed a hundred camel-loads of gold,
<lb/>Of drachms, of carpets, and things great and small
<lb/>Upon the water-carrier. Lambak
<lb/>Departed with his treasures. Then the Shah
<lb/>Called Baraham and said to him: <q>O thou
<lb/>Consorting in thy meanness with the dust!
<lb/>Dost tell me that thy prophet was long-lived,
<lb/>And yet bewail life’s superfluities?<note>If your prophet managed to live long on little so can you.</note>
<lb/>A horseman came and quoted me this saw,
<lb/>Out of the sayings of the past, which saith:
<lb/>‘Hath will enjoy and Hath not withereth.’
<lb/>So now withdraw thy grasping hand and watch
<lb/>Henceforth the enjoyment of the water-carrier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then to that vile Jew of the synagogue
<lb/>He spake at large of droppings, handkerchief
<lb/>Gold-woven, and tiles, bestowed upon the knave
<lb/>Four drachms, and said: <q>Take this as capital;
<lb/>No more befitteth thee. To mendicants
<lb/>Thy wealth, to thee thy head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave the poor
<lb/>All that there was. The Jew departed wailing.
<lb/>The Shah gave up the house to plundering;
<lb/>'Twas well that other folk should have their fling.
</p>

<pb n="21"/>
</div>

<head>§ 6 How Bahram slew Lions and forbade Wine-drinking</head>

<div>
<p>
<lb/>He found employment for the hunting cheetah,
<lb/>Bestirred him and was minded for the chase.
<lb/>He mounted him upon a speedy steed,
<lb/>And pricked forth to the plain with hawk on hand.
<lb/>He found a wood that was a rich man’s seat.
<lb/>It was as verdurous as Paradise,
<lb/>And there was neither man nor beast in sight.
<lb/>He said: <q>Here lions should be found. No man
<lb/>Of prudence would sleep here.</q>
<lb/>He entered in,
<lb/>And rode about surveying it. He saw
<lb/>A lion there and that he must employ
<lb/>The scimitar. He shouted at the beast
<lb/>And, when it bravely charged him, rode outside
<milestone unit="calced" n="1498"/>
<lb/>The forest, blazed forth like Azargashasp,

<lb/>And, when the lion followed, strung his bow,
<lb/>A hero he, shot and transfixed the creature
<lb/>Through side and heart; that of the lioness
<lb/>Grew all a-flame, and she too charged Bahram,
<lb/>Roared out and clawed at him. The cavalier
<lb/>Smote with his sword her loins, and that brave beast
<lb/>Gave up the fight. Now in the wood there dwelt
<lb/>A country magnate, a God-fearing man,
<lb/>Whose name was Mihr Bidad. That sword-stroke charmed him.
<lb/>With sweet words on his tongue that old man left
<lb/>The wood, drew near the Shah, blessed him, did reverence,
<lb/>And said: <q>O famous chief! may fortune’s star
<lb/>Be at thy beck. A rural chief am I,
<lb/>O holy one! and owner of this march,
<pb n="22"/>
<lb/>This tilth, and mansion, ox and ass and sheep.
<lb/>Those lions caused me sorrow and despair;
<lb/>Now by thy hand, thy thumb-ring, and thy hilt
<lb/>God hath removed them. Tarry in our wood,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>And I will bring thee milk and wine and honey.
<lb/>I have as many lambs as thou canst want
<lb/>With trees fruit-laden that will furnish shade.</q>


</p>
<p>

<lb/>The Shah alighted and surveyed the forest;
<lb/>He found it verdurous, supplied with streams,
<lb/>And fitted for a young man’s dwelling-place.
<lb/>Then Mihr Bidéd went and fetched minstrelsy
<lb/>As well as divers of the village-chiefs.
<lb/>He slaughtered numbers of fat sheep and came,
<lb/>Gold cup in hand. When they had eaten bread
<lb/>The servants set on cups of wine with roses
<lb/>And fenugreek. The host quaffed one and gave
<lb/>Another to Bahram and took all pains
<lb/>To set him at his ease. When Mihr Biddd
<lb/>Grew blithe with wine he said: <q>Fair-fortuned hero!
<lb/>Thou favourest the Shah or the full moon
<lb/>At midnight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram: <q>Yea, that is so;
<lb/>The King of kings designed this face of mine.
<lb/>He maketh as He willeth, waxing not
<lb/>Nor waning, but if I am like the Shah
<lb/>Then I have given thee this seat and forest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>This said, he mounted, sought his pleasure-palace,
<lb/>Bemused, but sleepless in the garth all night
<lb/>Romanced about the lips of the beloved.
</p><p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1499"/>

<lb/>Next morn he took his seat and called for wine.
<lb/>The captains of the host approached rejoicing,
<lb/>And with the others came a noble man
<lb/>Who from his village brought a gift of fruit—
<lb/>Pomegranate, apple, quince, in camel-loads,
<lb/>And posies fashioned for imperial use.
</p>

<pb n="23"/>

<p>
<lb/>The world-lord, seeing him, saluted him,
<lb/>And seated him among the paladins.
<lb/>The lord that brought the posies and the fruit
<lb/>Bore in the olden tongue the name Kirwi.
<lb/>While he was joying to behold the Shah,
<lb/>The nobles, and the banquet-hall, he spied
<lb/>A crystal goblet filled with wine which proved
<lb/>His ruin. Reaching out among the lords
<lb/>He grasped it, rose, and drank <q>The king of kings!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then cried: <q>A toper I, my name Kirwi.
<lb/>Since in the presence of the king of kings
<lb/>I drain the goblet I will drain again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>This said, he drained the goblet seven times,
<lb/>And distanced all the other revellers.
<lb/>Then by the Shah’s permission he departed
<lb/>To learn if he could bear off all that wine.
<lb/>He left the jovial city for the plain,
<lb/>And when the wine was warm within his breast
<lb/>He galloped from among his retinue
<lb/>Toward the hills, dismounted, chose him out
<lb/>A quiet, shady spot, and slumbered. Came
<lb/>A black crow from the mountains and pecked out
<lb/>His eyes! His escort following found him dead
<lb/>And eyeless with his roadster by his side,
<lb/>And wailed o’er him and at such revelry.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram had wakened in his chamber
<lb/>A courtier came to him, and said: <q>A crow
<lb/>Hath pecked out both Kirwi’s bright eyes while he
<lb/>Was lying drunk among the hills.</q>
<lb/>The world-lord
<lb/>Grew pale of cheek thereat and sorrowful,
<lb/>And from the palace proclamation issued:—
<lb/><q>Ye men of name endowed with Grace and sense!
<lb/>Wine is a thing forbidden in the world
<lb/>Alike to paladin and artisan.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus passed a year while all held wine forbidden
<pb n="24"/>


<lb/>E’en when the Shah himself held revelry,
<lb/>Or called for tales from old time legendry.
</p>
</div>

<head>§ 7 The Story of the young Shoemaker, and how Bahram allowed Wine again</head>

<div>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1500"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now at that time a young shoemaker wedded
<lb/>A virtuous wife, rich and of good repute,
<lb/>But failed in nuptial duty, and his mother
<lb/>Lamented bitterly his grievous case.
<lb/>Howbeit she had some wine in store. She took
<lb/>Her son to her own house and bade the youth:
<lb/><q>Drink seven cups to hearten thee. Perchance
<lb/>Thou mayest break this stubborn seal to-night.
<lb/>How can a woollen mattock mine in stone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He quaffed cups seven or eight, and verily
<lb/>His feet and hide waxed strong. The cups had made
<lb/>The young man confident; he came, achieved
<lb/>His purpose, and then went back to his mother
<lb/>In high delight thereat, and thus it chanced:
<lb/>A lion of the Shah’s had broken loose,
<lb/>And came along the road. Now at the time
<lb/>The shoemaker was still in drink—a sea
<lb/>That made his fingers thumbs. He ran, bestrode
<lb/>The roaring lion, and then reaching out
<lb/>He clutched its ears. The lion had been fed;
<lb/>The youth maintained his seat. Post-haste the keeper
<lb/>Came running after them, a chain in one hand,
<lb/>A lasso in the other. He beheld
<lb/>A shoemaker upon the lion’s back,
<lb/>Perched there like some bold rider on an ass,
<lb/>Ran to the palace-gate, came unabashed
<lb/>Before the Shah, and told about the wonder


<pb n="25"/>
<lb/>That he had seen, with his own eyes, and none
<lb/>Beside had heard. The world-lord all amazed
<lb/>Called the high priest and chiefs, and bade the former:
<lb/><q>See what the stock of this shoemaker is.
<lb/>If he shall prove a paladin by birth
<lb/>’Tis well, for courage fitteth paladins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They sought and asked his mother: <q>Is his rank
<lb/>Above his station?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When the talk grew long
<lb/>She hurried to the Shah and told him all,
<lb/>First doing her obeisance and exclaiming:
<lb/><q>Live happily till time shall be no more.
<lb/>This youth, who had not come to man’s estate,
<lb/>Must take himself a partner and keep house,
<lb/>And then prove impotent! His wife, she said:
<lb/>‘This weakling was self-sown!’ All privily
<lb/>I gave to him three cups of wine, and none
<lb/>In all the world was ware thereof. Forthwith
<milestone unit="calced" n="1501"/>
<lb/>It flushed his cheeks and made a man of him.
<lb/>Three cups of wine are his nobility;
<lb/>Who could imagine that the Shah would wish
<lb/>To hear thereof? Shoemaker was his granddad,
<lb/>And so is he, and not by birth above
<lb/>His trade.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah smiled on the crone, and said:
<lb/><q>This is no tale to hide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He thus addressed
<lb/>The archmage: <q>Wine is now permissible,
<lb/>And we should drink thereof to his extent
<lb/>Who in his cups still can bestride a lion,
<lb/>And not be overthrown, but not to his
<lb/>Who lieth all dead-drunk upon the road
<lb/>What while some black crow pecketh out his eyes.</q>
<lb/>A proclamation went up from the gate:
<lb/><q>O paladins who wear the golden girdle!
<lb/>Drink wine in moderation, all of you!
<pb n="26"/>
<lb/>Considering the end when ye begin,
<lb/>And when the wine hath led you to delight
<lb/>Then go to sleep but not in helpless plight.</q>
</p>

</div>

<head>§ 8 How Riuzbih, Bahram’s High Priest, ruined a Village by a Stratagem and restored it</head>

<div>
<p>
<lb/>The third day at the dawn the Shah went forth,
<lb/>He and his men, to hunt upon the plain;
<lb/>Hurmuz, his minister, was on his left,
<lb/>And on his right the holy archimage.
<lb/>They told him tales, discoursing of Jamshid
<lb/>And Faridun.<note>See Vol. i. pp. 129 seq., 147 seq.</note> Before them were the hounds,
<lb/>The cheetahs, hawks, and falcons. Thus they shortened
<lb/>The tedious day. Bright Sol was high, but still
<lb/>They saw no trace of deer or onager,
<lb/>And so Bahram Gur, troubled by the heat,
<lb/>Turned back in dudgeon from the hunting-field.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He came upon a verdurous spot fulfilled
<lb/>With houses, men, and cattle. Many folk
<lb/>Came from the settlement to see the troops,
<lb/>But no man did obeisance. Thou hadst said:
<lb/><q>The earth hath tethered every ass of them!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch, vexed and overcome by heat,
<lb/>Had fixed upon that village for a halt.
<lb/>Its folk disgusted him, he viewed them not
<lb/>With favour, and in anger thus addressed
<lb/>The high priest: <q>What an ill-starred spot is this!
<lb/>Be it a lair for wild beasts and for game,
<lb/>And may its streams run pitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archimage,
<lb/>Who took this for an order, turned aside
<pb n="27"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1502"/>
<lb/>Toward the village and informed the folk:
<lb/><q>This verdant spot—all fruitage, men, and cattle—
<lb/>Hath greatly pleased Bahram, the king of kings,
<lb/>Who hath a new design respecting it.
<lb/>He raiseth all of you to noble rank
<lb/>To turn this pleasant village to a city.
<lb/>Here, lord and hireling, ye shall be all equal.
<lb/>Men, women, children, ye shall be all chiefs,
<lb/>Each of you be the master of the village.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>Glad shouts rose from that prosperous settlement
<lb/>Because the people were all lords alike.
<lb/>Thenceforth, man’s rede or woman’s, 'twas all one,
<lb/>And slave and hireling were their master’s peers.
<lb/>The village-youths, no longer checked by awe,
<lb/>Cut off their elders’ heads, then fell upon
<lb/>Each other and, where roads were not, shed blood.
<lb/>At that to-do folk fled incontinent.
<lb/>The helpless aged remained, but there remained not
<lb/>The implements of culture, goods, and crops.
<lb/>The settlement had ruin in its face,
<lb/>The trees were withered and the streams ran dry,
<lb/>The land and houses were all desolate,
<lb/>And shunned of man and beast. Now when a year
<lb/>Had passed and spring returned the monarch went
<lb/>A-hunting in those parts and reached that spot
<lb/>Erst populous and blithe, and saw the place
<lb/>O’erturned, trees withered, habitations waste,
<lb/>And not a man or beast throughout the march.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thereat the Shah turned pale, the fear of God
<lb/>Came on him, he was grievously distressed,
<lb/>And thus addressed the archmage: <q>Wine is now permissible,
<lb/>And we should drink thereof to his extent

<lb/>Alack! this place so jocund once is ruined!
<lb/>Go to now and restore it with my treasures,
<lb/>And take such order that the folk henceforth
<lb/>Be scathless.</q></p>







<p>
<lb/>Going from the royal pesence
<pb n="28"/>
<lb/>The archmage sped forth to that scene of ruin.
<lb/>From street to street he hurried and at last
<lb/>Came on an old man unemployed. Dismounting
<lb/>He spake the elder fair, made him sit down
<lb/>Near by, and said to him: <q>Old, honoured sir!
<lb/>Who wrecked this district once so populous?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The old man answered thus: <q>Our monarch once
<lb/>Was passing through our parts, and thereupon
<lb/>There came to us a witless archimage,
<lb/>One of those useless people with big names,
<lb/>And said to us: ‘Ye all are chieftains here:
<lb/>See that ye pay respect to nobody.
<lb/>Be masters, all of you, both men and women,
<lb/>And great among the great.’ Such were his words,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1503"/>
<lb/>And all the township was convulsed thereat,
<lb/>All rapine, murder, stick! May God befriend him
<lb/>In like proportion, may grief, death, and hardship
<lb/>Ne’er stale with him. Our case is growing worse,
<lb/>And such that folk must weep for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Ruzbih,
<lb/>Grieved for that old man, asked: <q>Who is your chief?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The other answered: <q>Who will have a place
<lb/>Where there is naught excepting seed and grass?</q>
<lb/>Ruzbih replied: <q>Be thou the governor,
<lb/>Be as the crown upon the head in all things,
<lb/>Make requisition from the world-lord’s treasures
<lb/>For money, oxen, asses, grain, and produce;
<lb/>Bring to the village all the unemployed;
<lb/>They all are subjects, thou alone art chief,
<lb/>And curse no more the ancient archimage,
<lb/>Who spake not as he would in what he said.
<lb/>If thou wilt have assistants from the court
<lb/>I will dispatch them. Ask for what thou wilt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The elder joyed to hear this and was freed
<lb/>From longsome grief. He hied him home forthwith,
<pb n="29"/>
<lb/>Brought others to his Cistern and began
<lb/>To people and apportion out the lands.
<lb/>They borrowed from their neighbours ox and ass,
<lb/>And furnished all the plain. He and his settlers
<lb/>Worked hard and planted many trees on all sides,
<lb/>And, when his labour had restored one piece,
<lb/>The hearts of those that dwelt therein rejoiced.
<lb/>Those that had fled, their heart’s blood in their eyes,
<lb/>Flocked back on hearing of that restoration,
<lb/>And of the toils of that white-headed chief,
<lb/>And reinstated street and water-course,
<lb/>While fowl, ox, ass, and sheep all multiplied
<lb/>Upon the cultured parts, and everywhere
<lb/>Folk planted trees till that waste spot became
<lb/>Like Paradise. The third year he restored
<lb/>The town: the chief was blessed in all his labours.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When jocund spring came round the Shah went forth
<lb/>Upon the plain a-hunting with Ruzbih,
<lb/>The high priest. When the pair drew near the hamlet
<lb/>Bahram Gur suddenly beheld the world
<lb/>All crops and cattle, lofty mansions rose,
<lb/>And all the township thronged with sheep and oxen.
<lb/>'Twas all streams, pleasances, and growing crops,
<lb/>And fenugreek and tulips filled the hills,
<lb/>Whereon roamed sheep and lambs, for hill and dale
<lb/>Had grown to be a paradise. The Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1504"/>
<lb/>Said to the high priest: <q>O Ruzbih! what didst thou
<milestone unit="calced" n="1504"/>
<lb/>To make this verdant village waste and scatter
<lb/>Its men and beasts, and what hast thou dispensed
<lb/>In thus restoring it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The high priest answered:
<lb/><q>This ancient seat was ruined by a word,
<lb/>And by a word restored, to please the Shah.
<lb/>He bade me: ‘Take thou treasure and dinars,
<lb/>And make this verdant spot a wilderness,’
<lb/>But I feared God and blame from great and small.
<pb n="30"/>

<lb/>When friends, though one in heart, are two in aim
<lb/>’Tis ruin, as I have perceived, to both;
<lb/>So when there are two rulers in a state
<lb/>Their land will be o’erturned. I went and said
<lb/>Thus to the elders of this settlement:
<lb/>‘O men! there is no ruler over you
<lb/>From this time forth, but women, children, slaves,
<lb/>Hirelings and husbandmen, are lords alike.’
<lb/>When those who had been underlings became
<lb/>Lords too the nobles’ heads were all brought low,
<lb/>And all the place was ruined by a word.
<lb/>Thus was I far removed from all reproach,
<lb/>And apprehension of God’s chastisement.
<lb/>Thereafter, when the Shah had ruth on them,
<lb/>I went and pointed out another course;
<lb/>I made a wise, old man and eloquent,
<lb/>A man of leading and informed, the ruler.
<lb/>He laboured and restored the waste, rejoicing
<lb/>His subjects’ hearts. When one man ruled, the course
<lb/>Was good, prosperity increased, ill waned.
<lb/>I, unobserved, had shown them what was bad,
<lb/>And opened afterward the way of God.
<lb/>Discourse is better than fine-watered gems
<lb/>When ’tis employed aright. Let wisdom be
<lb/>The Shah, the tongue the paladin, if thou
<lb/>Wouldst have thy spirit easy. May thy heart
<lb/>Be glad for aye and free from wile and waste.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing, cried: <q>Well done, Ruzbih!
<lb/>Thou’rt worthy of a crown!</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur gave
<lb/>That old man worshipful and prescient
<lb/>A purse all filled with gold dinars. For him
<lb/>A robe of honour too they fashioned
<lb/>Of royal stuffs, and cloud-ward raised his head.

<div><head>§ 9 How Bahram married a Country-miller’s Daughters</head>


<p>
<lb/>Another week the monarch of the world
<lb/>Went forth to hunt with lords and archimages,
<lb/>Prepared to spend a month upon the chase,
<lb/>To revel with his meiny, and to take
<lb/>Illimitable game on waste and mountain.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1505"/>
<lb/>He and his escort reached in merry pin
<lb/>A town. The night came on, and all was dark.
<lb/>The chiefs dismissed the escort and recited
<lb/>Tales of the Shahs. He saw afar a fire,
<lb/>Such as Shahs kindle on Bahman’s high day.<note>The day Bahman of the month Bahman was a time of festivity.</note>
<lb/>The king of kings gazed at the light and spied
<lb/>A pleasant village with a mill before it,
<lb/>Where sat the village-chiefs, while all the maidens,
<lb/>Each with a crown of roses on her head,
<lb/>Were feasting by themselves beside the fire.
<lb/>The minstrels sat about, the maidens sang
<lb/>Tales of the royal wars, and every one
<lb/>Began to tell a story in her turn.
<lb/>They all were moon-faced, all had locks a-curl,
<lb/>All were sweet-spoken, and all savoured musk.
<lb/>They sat ranked on the grass and close before
<lb/>The mill-door, singing, with a posy each,
<lb/>And half bemused with wine and merriment.
<lb/>Then from that scene of revel rose a cry,
<lb/>And one exclaimed: <q>The toast of Shah Bahram!
<lb/>He hath Grace, stature, mien, and love. Before him
<lb/>The rolling sphere upstandeth. Thou wouldst say:
<lb/>‘His face distilleth wine, the scent of musk
<lb/>Proceedeth from his hair.’ He only hunteth
<lb/>The lion and the onager, and so
<lb/>Folk title him ‘Bahram Gur.’</q>
</p>

<pb n="32"/>

<p>
<lb/>This he heard,
<lb/>And rode toward them. Drawing near the girls
<lb/>He scanned the plain, beheld it filled with Moons,
<lb/>And saw that he should stop short of the city.
<lb/>He bade, and from the road cup-bearers came,
<lb/>Provided wine and boon-companions,
<lb/>And handed him a crystal cup. Meanwhile
<lb/>Four of the girls, those chief in rank, came forth—
<lb/>One Mushkinab,<note>Mushkinaz in C. and P. Mushkinab means "Pure Musk"; Mushkinak is a speoies of bird; Naztab is "Charmer,"  and Susanak “Little
Lily.”</note> the others Mushkinak,
<lb/>Naztab, and Sasanak. With cheeks like spring,
<lb/>With stately mien, and hand in hand, they went
<lb/>Before the Shah and sang about Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, the wise and prosperous.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur asked, for they perturbed his heart:
<lb/><q>Who are ye,<note>Reading with P.</note> rose-cheeked? Wherefore is this fire?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O cavalier of cypress-height,
<lb/>So like a king in everything! our father
<milestone unit="calced" n="1506"/>
<lb/>Is an old miller who is shooting game
<lb/>Upon this mountain and will come anon
<lb/>Since it is night, and he can see no longer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>With that the miller and his men came bringing
<lb/>Their quarry. When his eyes fell on Bahram Gur
<lb/>He rubbed his face upon the dust and bore him
<lb/>With awe and reverence. The Shah bade give
<lb/>That old man just arrived a golden cup,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Why keepest thou these four
<lb/>With sunny faces thus? Is it not time
<lb/>For them to wed?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The old man offered praise,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is no husband for them; they
<lb/>Are maidens still and pure in chastity,
<lb/>But that is all the property they have,
<lb/>And this is all that I can say for them.</q>
</p>

<pb n="33"/>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram said: <q>Give me all the four, and henceforth
<lb/>Regard them not as daughters.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Quoth the ancient:
<lb/><q>Do not as thou hast said, O cavalier!
<lb/>No cups have we, no land, no crops, no silver,
<lb/>No mansion, ox, and ass.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur said:
<lb/><q>'Tis well, for I would have them portionless.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller said: <q>The four shall be thy wives,
<lb/>The handmaids of the dust within thy chambers.
<lb/>Thine eye hath seen their good points and their ill,
<lb/>And, seeing, hath approved.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur said:
<lb/><q>From holy God, the All-giver, I accept them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake and rose. Steeds neighed upon the plain.
<lb/>He bade the eunuchs of his escort bear
<lb/>Those Idols to the royal women’s house,
<lb/>And through the night the troops filed o’er the waste.
<lb/>The miller marvelled, mused all night, and said:
<lb/><q>This moon-like lord so tall
<lb/>And masterful, how came he here by night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>She answered: <q>He perceived the fire from far,
<lb/>The noise the girls were making, and the sound
<lb/>Of minstrels, harp, and revelry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller
<lb/>Said to his wife: <q>Advise me, O my spouse!
<lb/>If this affair will turn out well or ill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>She answered: <q>It is all God’s providence.
<lb/>The man, on seeing them, asked not their race,
<lb/>Thought not of dowry. On earth’s face he sought
<lb/>For Moons and not for money or kings’ daughters.
<lb/>If idol-worshippers saw these in Chin
<lb/>There would be no more idol-worshipping!</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1507"/>
<lb/>Thus till above the Raven’s back the sun 
<lb/>Rose, and the world grew like a shining lamp,
<lb/>They talked at large of base and upright men,

<pb n="34"/>            

<lb/>But with the day the village-chief arrived,
<lb/>And said to that old man: <q>O brave of luck!<note>"O vaillant Rouzbeh." Mohl.</note>
<lb/>Good fortune visited thy couch last night!
<lb/>The verdant branches of thy tree bear fruit.
<lb/>One looked, beheld the merriment and fire,
<lb/>And, having turned his horse about, drew near;
<lb/>So now thy daughters have become his wives,
<lb/>And rest securely in his women’s house.
<lb/>By giving them such faces, hair, and carriage
<lb/>Thou didst prepare them for the Shah! Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, is now thy son-in-law!
<lb/>Henceforth thou wilt be famous through the realm.
<lb/>He hath bestowed upon thee all this province
<lb/>And march, so sorrow not, for thou hast 'scaped
<lb/>From cares and fears. Command. 'Tis thine to bid.
<lb/>We all of us are thralls and bound to thee;
<lb/>We all of us are subject to thee now,
<lb/>Are subject! Rather we are all thy slaves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller and his wife in their amaze
<lb/>Invoked God’s name. The village-chieftain said:
<lb/><q>Such locks as those and countenances too
<lb/>Would bring the sun from his fourth heaven to woo.</q>
</p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 10 How Bahram found the Treasures of Jamshid and bestowed them upon the Poor</head>
<p>
<lb/>Another week he went forth to the chase
<lb/>With favourites from the host and archimages.
<lb/>Swift as the wind there came a loyal liege
<lb/>With spade in hand and asking of the troops
<lb/>Where was Bahram, the Shah, amid the throng?
<lb/>An archimage replied: <q>What wilt thou? Speak.
<pb n="35"/>  
<lb/>Thou canst not see the monarch of the world.</q><note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The man said: <q>Since I may see not his face
<lb/>I will speak not before his followers.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>They brought before the Shah that seeker—one
<lb/>Both learned and eloquent—who seeing him
<lb/>Said: <q>I have words to speak to thee in private.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur turned his horse’s head aside,
<lb/>And rode some distance from his followers’ sight.
<lb/>Then said the man: <q>O world-possessing Shah!
<lb/>Thou must observe my words. A countryman
<lb/>Am I, and landlord here. I own the soil,
<lb/>The homestead, and the crops. I was engaged
<lb/>In making water-courses on my land
<lb/>To benefit my property, and when
<lb/>There was much water, and the stream ran strong,
<lb/>In one place there was formed an orifice,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1508"/>
<lb/>A wondrous clamour reached mine ears, and I
<lb/>Came crying out in terror of my life.
<lb/>The clash of cymbals issued from the stream—
<lb/>A sound denoting treasure.</q><note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>Bahram Gur weal and saw a plain all verdure,
<lb/>And watered, bade bring labourers with spades
<lb/>From far, and lighted from his steed. They pitched
<lb/>His tent among the crops. Night came. The warriors
<lb/>Lit lamps and everywhere enkindled fires.
<lb/>Now when the sun set up above the deep
<lb/>Its banner, burnishing the violet air,
<lb/>The workmen mustered from all sides, as though
<lb/>A mighty army, and began to dig.
<lb/>That portion of the plain was excavate,
<lb/>And, as the workers wearied, there appeared
<lb/>Out of the dust a mount-like place—a mansion
<lb/>Of mortar and burnt brick—like Paradise.
<lb/>They plied their picks; far down a doorway showed.
</p>        
<pb n="36"/>
<p>
<lb/>An archmage, seeing, entered by the door,
<lb/>He and another uninvited guest.
<lb/>They found a single chamber long and wide,
<lb/>And many cubits high. Within it stood
<lb/>Two buffaloes of gold and, fronting them,
<lb/>A golden laver strewn with emeralds
<lb/>And rubies mixed. They seemed two Signs of Taurus,
<lb/>Were hollow, and were filled up with pomegranates,
<lb/>With apples, and with quinces that contained
<lb/>Fine-watered pearls, each like a water-drop.
<lb/>The buffaloes had jewel-eyes, and heads
<lb/>Decayed with age. Ranked round them there were
<lb/>lions
<lb/>And onagers, some having ruby eyes,
<lb/>And others crystal. There were golden pheasants
<lb/>And peacocks, with their breasts and eyes all gems.
<lb/>The minister, whose wisdom was a crown
<lb/>Upon the moon, on seeing that spectacle,
<lb/>Went to the Shah and cried excitedly:—
<lb/><q>Arise. Enough to dower thy treasuries
<lb/>Is here! A chamber filled with precious stones
<lb/>Is manifest, whose key high heaven hath kept!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>His lord said: <q>One of counsel and of might
<lb/>Would write his name upon his treasures. See
<lb/>Whose name is there and when they were amassed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On hearing this the high priest went and saw
<lb/>The impress of the signet of Jamshid
<lb/>Upon the buffaloes, and notified
<lb/>The monarch of the world: <q>I have beheld,
<lb/>And 'Shah Jamshid' is on the buffaloes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1509"/>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>O high priest in all regards
<lb/>More learned than sages! wherefore make mine own
<lb/>The treasures that Jamshid laid up of yore?
<lb/>May nothing e’er be added to my wealth
<lb/>Unless by justice and the scimitar.
<lb/>Bestow the whole upon the poor. God grant
<pb n="37"/>
<lb/>That no mishap befall us. For my troops
<lb/>No share is requisite, our valour openeth
<lb/>The earth to us. As is the use of kings
<lb/>'Tis needful that we count up all this wealth,
<lb/>Sell all the gems for cash, and then assemble
<lb/>From desert and from settlement the widows,
<lb/>The orphans, and the impoverished men of name—
<lb/>Those lost to aspiration, fame, and ease—
<lb/>Then take the sum of such, including those
<lb/>That, troubled by their debts, should have a share,
<lb/>And give to them the money and the goods
<lb/>To assoil Jamshid the world-lord’s soul, but I
<lb/>Am youthful still, and sound in wind and limb;
<lb/>Why should I seek his treasures? Let one tenth
<lb/>Be for the finder, who sought out the Shah,
<lb/>But never let him hope for joy hereafter
<lb/>That beareth off the cerecloth from Jamshid.
<lb/>To compass toil in consort with my troops,
<lb/>And treasure and renown from Rum and Chin,
<lb/>That is for me and for my steed, Shabdiz,
<lb/>And for my trenchant scimitar. No shifts,
<lb/>Or shirks, for me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He went back to the treasure
<lb/>Won by his sweat and toil, assembled all
<lb/>The warriors of the realm, and gave his troops
<lb/>A whole year’s pay. He held a feast that spring,
<lb/>Adorned his hall of jewelled tracery,
<lb/>And, when the red wine shone in crystal cups,
<lb/>And he himself was jocund and right glad,
<lb/>He thus harangued his friends: <q/> Exalted ones,
<lb/>Who know the token of the throne of kings!
<lb/>Down from Hushang as far as famed Naudar,
<lb/>Who was a memory of Faridin,
<lb/>And on again right up to Kai Kubad,
<lb/>Who placed the crown of greatness on his head,
<lb/>See who of all these mighty men is left,
<pb n="38"/>
<lb/>And who remaineth to applaud their justice ?
<lb/>Now, since the circle of their years is cut,
<lb/>Their reputation is their monument,
<lb/>Which saith that this had spirit, that had not,
<lb/>And one doth blame them, and another praise.
<lb/>We all shall pass in turn, and not to walk
<milestone unit="calced" n="1510"/>
<lb/>The world for ill is well. Why should I need
<lb/>The treasure of those gone ? Why should my heart
<lb/>Expand toward dinars ? I will not set it
<lb/>Upon this Wayside Inn, or make my boast
<lb/>Of crown, or clutch at treasure. If the days
<lb/>Pass in delight why should the wise eat grief ?
<lb/>Whene’er a liege of mine, a countryman
<lb/>Or courtier, shall complain of mine oppression
<lb/>Then may my head and crown and treasure perish.<q/>
<lb/>There was an ancient man, hight Mahiyar,
<lb/>Whose years had reached eight score and four. He
<lb/>On hearing this, and spake thus: <q/> O just lord !
<lb/>Tales have we heard of Faridun, Jamshid,
<lb/>And others more or less renowned, but none
<lb/>Hath heard of Shah like thee—the lowly’s hope,
<lb/>The Glory of the great—and were the sea
<lb/>Large as thy heart ’twould rise in waves of gems,
<lb/>For from thy soul the radiance of Surush
<lb/>Proceedeth, dwarfing all a wise man’s wit.
<lb/>Thou hast so lavished treasure in the world
<lb/>That no one great or small hath seen the like.
<lb/>When men spake of the era of Jamshid,
<lb/>And of the treasure of the buffaloes,
<lb/>None wotted where it was—beneath the dust,
<lb/>Or in the dragon’s breath—but having found it
<lb/>Thou didst not look thereon, for thou didst scorn
<lb/>This Wayside Hostelry. Good sooth! no king
<lb/>Hath seen, nor will a hundred see, such jewels
<lb/>As these in any sea, yet these and all
<pb n="39"/>
<lb/>The buffaloes and onagers thou gavest
<lb/>Without exception to the poor! May crown
<lb/>And girdle never lack thee. Health be thine,
<lb/>Be victor thou and fortune’s favourite.
<lb/>The ink would blacken many a royal roll
<lb/>To tell this tale and yet not reach the end.
<lb/>Thou being gone thy name will live in praise
<lb/>When folk recount the story of thy days.<q/></p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 11 How Bahram, returning from Hunting, went to the House of a Merchant and departed displeased</head>

<p>
<lb/>One day, another week, he went to hunt,
<lb/>When indisposed, and took his bow and arrows.
<lb/>The plain grew sultry with the blazing sun.
<lb/>He came back from his hunting leisurely,
<lb/>And reached a merchant’s house, to whom he said,
<lb/>On looking round and seeing none beside :
<lb/>“Canst give us lodging since thou wilt not find us
<lb/>A trouble ? ”
<milestone unit="calced" n="1511"/>
<lb/>Having helped him to dismount
<lb/>The merchant found a place for him. The Shah,
<lb/>Complaining of the colic, gave the merchant
<lb/>Some drachms, and said: “ Toast some old cheese
<lb/>with almonds.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The merchant did not do as he was asked,
<lb/>Not having almonds by him, but, at night-fall
<lb/>And at his leisure, got a hot roast fowl,
<lb/>And served it to Bahram upon a tray,
<lb/>Who said : “ I asked thee for old cheese, besought thee
<lb/>To bring it, and thou hast not brought it me
<lb/>Although I gave thee drachms and had complained
<lb/>Of colic.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said the merchant : “ Foolish fellow !
<pb n="40"/>
<lb/>Thy soul is starving through thy lack of wit.
<lb/>Since I have brought to thee this hot roast fowl
<lb/>Mere shame should stay thee asking aught beside.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram thereat ceased longing for old cheese.
<lb/>Grieved at his words he ate, referring not
<lb/>To what had passed. When it was sleeping-time
<lb/>He slept and said naught further to the merchant.
<lb/>Now when the sun rose o’er the heaving deep,
<lb/>And when the Cloak pitch-hued had disappeared,
<lb/>The wealthy merchant said to his apprentice :—
<lb/>“O simpleton ! why didst thou buy a fowl
<lb/>Not worth a drachm for more and wrong me 50 ?
<lb/>Had’t been a proper fowl then he and I
<lb/>Had fallen not out last night, or hadst thou spent
<lb/>A quarter of a drachm in buying cheese
<lb/>He would have been to me like milk and water
<lb/>To-day.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The apprentice answered : <q>Tis all one.
<lb/>Know that the fowl is at my charge. Be thou
<lb/>And he my guests, so quarrel not with me
<lb/>About the bird.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram arose
<lb/>From pleasant sleep he sought his docile steed
<lb/>To saddle it and go back to his palace,
<lb/>And from his palace raise his crown to Saturn.
<lb/>The apprentice, seeing him, said to Bahram :—
<lb/><q>Give to thy slave thy company to-day.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah returned, sat down again, and marvelled
<lb/>At fortune. Then the youth went out and fetched
<lb/>Two hundred almonds and addressed his master :—
<lb/><q>Bestir thee, sir ! and have these almonds toasted,
<lb/>Make ready too some cheese and some new bread,
<lb/>For such the cavalier asked yesterday,
<lb/>Bring food and spread the board.</q>
<lb/>He went before
<pb n="41"/>
<lb/>Bahram and said: “O cavalier! I bring thee
<milestone unit="calced" n="1512"/>
<lb/>All hot what yesterday thou didst require,
<lb/>And there is more to follow in due course.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus saying he set off to the bazar,
<lb/>A different sort of purchaser. He bought
<lb/>More almonds, sugar, fowl, and lamb to make
<lb/>An ample meal, wine, saffron, musk, rose-water,
<lb/>And hurried home. He brought the board all spread
<lb/>With dainty meats. A sprightly youth was he
<lb/>And well disposed. The eating done, he brought
<lb/>Forth cups of wine, first serving king Bahram,
<lb/>And thus, till blithe and jocund, they proceeded
<lb/>From eating to the cup. The Shah addressed
<lb/>His entertainer thus: <q> Bahram will be
<lb/>Inquiring for me, but do ye drink on,
<lb/>Grow drunk, and budge not till ye prove yourselves
<lb/>Wine-worshippers.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then rubbing down and saddling
<lb/>Shabdiz he started, blithe with wine, for court,
<lb/>First saying to the merchant : <q/> Toil not so
<lb/>In quest of gain, O thou that sellest dear !
<lb/>‘Thou wouldst have sold me for a quarter drachm
<lb/>Yestreen, sewn up the eyes of thine apprentice
<lb/>Because he bought a fowl above the price,
<lb/>And have put me within the dragon’s maw.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake and sped back to his royal seat.
<lb/>Now when the sun displayed its crown in heaven
<lb/>The guardian of the world sat on his throne
<lb/>Of ivory and bade the chamberlain
<lb/>Seek out the merchant and conduct him thither
<lb/>With his apprentice. One of them was glad,
<lb/>The other glum. Bahram, on seeing the apprentice,
<lb/>Made much of him and seated him rejoicing
<lb/>Among the lords. They brought to him a purse,
<lb/>And made his awe-gloomed spirit like the moon.
<lb/>Then to the merchant said Bahram : <q> Know this:
<pb n="42"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1513"/>
<lb/>Thou shalt be slave for life to thine apprentice,
<lb/>And, further, pay him twice in every month
<lb/>Three score drachms from thy savings. With thy goods
<lb/>He shall be entertainer and make laugh
<lb/>The hearts of noble men.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then to the high priest :—
<lb/><q>The king that disregardeth this world’s doings,
<lb/>How can he know what man is truly great,
<lb/>Or how discern the evil from the good?</q>
<lb/>So now, O sage that seekest wisdom’s way,
<lb/>If thou must have a saw hear what I say :—
<lb/>Avoid all avarice if man thou be,
<lb/>Or be indeed below humanity.<q/>
</p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 12 How Bahram slew a Dragon and went to a Yokel’s House</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram abode a season with his lords,
<lb/>With sparkling wine, with cup, and minstrelsy.
<lb/>Spring came, the ground seemed Paradise, the air
<lb/>Sowed tulips on earth’s face, all tracts grew full
<lb/>Of game, and in the brooks the waters seemed
<lb/>Like wine and milk. The deer and onager
<lb/>Paced in the dales or clustered on the sward,
<lb/>The blackbirds haunted all the river-banks,
<lb/>And all around them bent pomegranate-blooms.
<lb/>‘Tis long, the nobles said to Shah Bahram Gar,
<lb/>Since we have hunted onager.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered :—
<lb/><q>Choose we a thousand horsemen from the host,
<lb/>And let them bring the cheetahs and the hawks,

<pb n="43"/>
<lb/>The falcons and the noble peregrines,
<lb/>Go to Turan and pass a month in hunting.</q></p>    


<p>
<lb/>The royal hunter went. He found the world
<lb/>All hues and scent. His gallant chieftains swept it
<lb/>For onager, gazelle, and mountain-sheep—
<lb/>A labour that extended o’er two days—
<lb/>What while Bahram had wine in hand; the third,
<lb/>When Sol illumed its crown, when earth grew golden,
<lb/>And hill and stream became as ivory,
<lb/>The valiant Shah went to the chase and saw
<lb/>A dragon like a lion. From its head
<lb/>Hair hung down to the ground, and it had breasts
<lb/>Like those of women. Then Bahram Gar strung
<lb/>His bow and shot forthwith a poplar arrow
<lb/>Against the dragon’s chest. He shot another
<lb/>Straight at its head, and gore and venom flowed
<lb/>Adown its front. The king dismounted, drew
<lb/>His sword, and carved up all the dragon’s breast.
<lb/>It had gulped down a youth and frozen him
<lb/>In blood and bane. Bahram bewailed him sorely
<lb/>What while the venom blinded his own eyes.
<lb/>He took the corpse out of the dragon’s maw,
<lb/>Ne’er may its head and breast unite again.
<lb/>He rode off dizzied, suffering, and longing
<lb/>For sleep and water, reached a settlement,
<lb/>Arriving at a house-door from the waste,
<lb/>And saw a woman shouldering a pitcher.
<lb/>She veiled her face from him. He said to her :—
<lb/>“Can I lodge here or must I toil on still ?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She said: “Brave horseman! treat this house as thine.”
<lb/>On hearing this he rode his courser in.
<lb/>His hostess called her husband. “Bring a wisp,”
<lb/>She said, “and rub his steed. At feeding-time
<lb/>Feed from the sack.”
<milestone unit="calced" n="1503"/>
<lb/>She went to her own chamber,
<pb n="44"/>
<lb/>Swept out the house and laid down mat and pillow,
<lb/>With blessings on Bahram, went to the cistern,
<lb/>Drew water, and berated to herself
<lb/>Her spouse the while: “The fool will ne’er bestir
<lb/>Himself on seeing some one in the house.
<lb/>This is not women’s work, but for my part
<lb/>I, soldier-like, can only grin and bear it!”
<lb/>She brought and spread the board with vinegar
<lb/>And salad, bread and curds. Went Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And bathed his face, for he had been o’erwrought
<lb/>In fighting with that dragon. So he ate
<lb/>A little, then lay down and groaned, his face
<lb/>Concealed beneath a kerchief made in Chin.
<lb/>The woman, when she woke, said to her spouse:—
<lb/>“O knave with unwashed face! thou shouldest slay
<lb/>A lamb because this cavalier is great,
<lb/>And of the royal seed, hath kingly bearing,
<lb/>And moon-like Grace, and he is like to none
<lb/>Save Shah Bahram.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Her mean spouse said to her:—
<lb/>“Why such to-do? Thou hast no salted meat,
<lb/>No fire-wood, and no bread, and spinnest not
<lb/>A-nights as others do. When thou hast killed
<lb/>A lamb, and he—this cavalier—hath eaten
<lb/>And gone, then go, buy, mingle with the throng;
<lb/>The winter, cold, and blast undoubtedly
<lb/>Will come on thee no less.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>So spake her spouse.
<lb/>She hearkened not, for she was good and wise,
<lb/>And in the end her husband slew a lamb
<lb/>At her entreaty for the cavalier.
<lb/>When it was slain she made a pot of broth,
<lb/>And lit a fire with half-burnt sticks, then brought
<lb/>The tray with eggs thereon and water-cresses,
<lb/>A roasted leg of lamb and everything
<lb/>That she had cooked. Bahram, when he had washed
<pb n="45"/>
<lb/>His hands, his dinner done, felt indisposed
<lb/>For slumber and still ailed. Now when the night
<lb/>Foregathered with the sun the woman fetched
<lb/>Wine and a harp. “O woman of few words!”
<lb/>The Shah said, “tell to me some old-world tale
<lb/>That while thou art reciting I may quaff
<lb/>To chase away my pain and cares. I give thee
<lb/>Free speech about the Shah for praise or blame.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That woman of few words said: <q/>Yea, 'tis well,
<lb/>For he is first and last in everything.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram responded: <q/>He is so indeed,
<lb/>But he is just and good to nobody.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That dame of spirit said: <q/>O honest man!
<lb/>This place hath many folk and many homes,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1515"/>
<lb/>And always cavaliers are passing through
<lb/>From public offices and ministers.
<lb/>If one of them shall call a man a thief
<lb/>The accused will have much trouble afterward.
<lb/>The cavalier to compass some few drachms
<lb/>Will make the poor man's life a misery,
<lb/>Or one may smirch some honest woman's fame,
<lb/>And make her fall to folly. This is loss,
<lb/>Because the treasury is none the richer.
<lb/>This is our trouble with our Shah, the world-lord.<q/>
<lb/>The king grew full of thought at that account—
<lb/>How those in power were wronging his good name—
<lb/>And then the pious Shah thought with himself:—
<lb/>No one doth praise the just. Henceforward I
<lb/>Will play the tyrant for a while that love
<lb/>And justice may grow manifest from ill.<q/>
<lb/>Vexed by dark thoughts he passed a sleepless night,
<lb/>His heart allied to tyranny the while.
<lb/>Now when Sol rent its musky-scented veil,
<lb/>And showed its face in heaven, the woman left
<lb/>The house and bade her spouse: <q/>Bring pot and fire,
<lb/>And in the water put all kinds of grain
<pb n="46"/>

<lb/>Before the sun shall see it. Mind it well
<lb/>While I go milk the cow.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She brought the cow
<lb/>From pasture, got much grass, and threw it down
<lb/>Before her; then she tried the udders, crying:—
<lb/>In God's name who hath neither mate nor peer!<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She found the udder milkless, and the heart
<lb/>Of that young hostess aged. She told her husband:—
<lb/>Good man! our monarch's heart hath changed in purpose,
<lb/>The world's king hath become tyrannical!
<lb/>A secret change came o'er his heart last night.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: <q/>What words are these? Why go and croak?<q/>
<lb/>She thus replied: <q/>My dear one! what I say
<lb/>Is sober truth, for when the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Hath grown unjust the moon may shine not forth
<lb/>In heaven, the udders are dry, the musk-bags lose
<lb/>Their scent, adultery and guile are rampant,
<lb/>The tender heart becometh flinty, wolves
<lb/>Devour folk on the waste, the sage doth flee
<lb/>The fool, and eggs are addled 'neath the hens
<lb/>What time the Shah becometh tyrannous.
<lb/>The pasture of this cow had minished not,
<lb/>Her watering-place supplied her as before,
<lb/>Yet is her udder dry, her lowing changed.<q/>
<lb/>On hearing this the Shah forthwith repented,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1516"/>
<lb/>And prayed to God: <q/>O Thou who art supreme,
<lb/>Almighty, and the Arbiter of fortune!
<lb/>If e'er my heart shall turn away from justice
<lb/>Then be the throne of kings no longer mine.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That blesséd dame, who worshipped holy God,
<lb/>Tried with her hand the udder once again,
<lb/>She tried it in the Lord's name, saying thus:—
<lb/>Cause Thou the milk to flow.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The milk flowed forth.
<pb n="47"/>
<lb/>The good wife cried: <q/>O God, our Succourer!
<lb/>Thou hast recalled to justice the unjust,
<lb/>For, if not so, this virtue were not his.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then said she to the master of the house:—
<lb/>The justice of the unjust is restored.
<lb/>Laugh and rejoice; this is the Maker's boon
<lb/>To us.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the porridge had been cooked,
<lb/>And man and wife had done that chare, the good dame,
<lb/>And after her the master of the house,
<lb/>Who bare the tray, went to their guest. Upon it
<lb/>There was a bowl of porridge, oh! how good
<lb/>Had it been but some broth! The Shah ate somewhat,
<lb/>Then spake thus to that kindly dame: <q/>Take thou
<lb/>This whip outside and hang it where folk pass.
<lb/>Choose out a proper bough because the wind
<lb/>Must harm it not, then note the passers by
<lb/>With one eye on the whip.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good-man went
<lb/>Forthwith, he hung the whip upon a tree,
<lb/>And kept his eye thereon a while. There came
<lb/>Innumerable troops along the road,
<lb/>And all that saw the whip there hailed Bahram.
<lb/>They lighted down before that lengthy whip,
<lb/>And passed saluting. <q/>'Tis the Shah, none else!<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good-man told his spouse. <q/>Naught but the throne
<lb/>Could fit a face like that!<q/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then full of awe
<lb/>Both ran to him and cried: <q>“O Shah! O great!
<pb n="47"/>
<lb/>O mighty one! O sage, high priest and world-lord!
<lb/>A humble woman and her gardener-spouse
<lb/>Have been thy poor hosts in this house. Withal
<lb/>They did not do their best. We ne’er suspected
<lb/>That ’twas the Shah, that such an one as he
<lb/>Would come to this place as a guest, would come
<lb/>To this poor home of ours.”</q>
<lb/>Bahram replied:—
<lb/><q>Good friend! I give to thee this march, the land,
<lb/>And village. Be thou ever hospitable;
<lb/>Be that, and give up garden-work.</q>
<lb/>He spoke,
<lb/>And laughing left the house, got on his steed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1517"/>
<lb/>Wind-footed, and from that poor village reached
<lb/>His jewelled halls. The nobles of Iran
<lb/>Went thither for the chase, three hundred strong,
<lb/>And each with thirty servants in his train
<lb/>Of Turkman, Raman, or of Persian strain.
</p>
<head>§ 13 How Bahram went to the Chase and espoused themDaughters of the Thane Barzin</head>

<p>
<lb/>The third day after this the Shah went forth
<lb/>With escort, the equipment for the chase,
<lb/>Ten camels all in housings of brocade
<lb/>With stirrups silver and with dossers gold,
<lb/>Ten camels with the Shah’s pavilion,
<lb/>And his brocaded seat. In front of these
<lb/>Were seven elephants which bare the throne
<lb/>Of turquoise dyed like Nile; its feet were all
<lb/>Of gold and crystal; ’twas the throne itself
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram Gur. Every swordsman there
<lb/>Had thirty pages who had golden belts
<lb/>And bridles, while a hundred camels served
<lb/>To bear the minstrels wearing massive crowns.
<lb/>The falconers had eight score hawks with them,
<lb/>And ten score noble peregrines and falcons.
<lb/>Among them there was one bird black of hue,
<pb n="49"/>
<lb/>More precious in the Shah’s eyes than the rest,
<lb/>With sable talons and with yellow beak,
<lb/>Like gold a-gleam on lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>They called it a tughral. Its eyes were like
<lb/>Two goblets full of blood. The Khan of Chin
<lb/>Had sent it with a throne and crown, with amber,
<lb/>A golden torque inlaid with emeralds,
<lb/>With two score armlets, and with thrice twelve earrings,
<lb/>Three hundred camel-loads of rarities
<lb/>Of Chin, and fifteen score of ruby signets.
<lb/>Behind the falconers they led eight score
<lb/>Of cheetahs for that Lustre of the world—
<lb/>The Shah—with jewelled torques and chains of gold.
<lb/>Thus came the king of kings upon the plain,
<lb/>And raised his crown o’er Jupiter. The sportsmen
<lb/>Made for the river whither used the Shah
<lb/>Auspiciously to fare each seventh year.
<lb/>As they drew near they found the river full
<lb/>Of water-fowl. He had the tabor beaten,
<lb/>And the tughral flew off. The imperious bird
<lb/>Was all impatience; in its claws a crane
<lb/>Was helpless quarry, and a pard had been
<milestone unit="calced" n="1518"/>
<lb/>Its proper prey. At length it soared from sight,
<lb/>And bound a crane, then soared again and flew
<lb/>Like shaft from bow, the falconer pursuing.
<lb/>The Shah was vexed that it had flown away,
<lb/>And followed by the tinkling of its bells.
<lb/>He came upon a spacious pleasure-ground,
<lb/>With mansion rising in a coign thereof,—
<lb/>And thither went with certain of his men,
<lb/>The rest remaining on the hunting-field.
<lb/>On entering Bahram Gur saw a garden
<lb/>As ’twere a mountain-skirt. Upon the ground
<lb/>Brocade was spread, and all the place was full
<lb/>Of slaves and wealth. A pool was in the centre
<lb/>Whereby an old man sat. Three girls like ivory
<pb n="50"/>
<lb/>Sat by him wearing turquoise crowns. Their cheeks
<lb/>Were like the spring, their statures tall, their eyebrows
<lb/>Arched, and their tresses lassos; each girl held
<lb/>A crystal goblet, and Bahram Gar saw them.
<lb/>His eyes were dazzled at the spectacle
<lb/>Just as his heart was gloomed for his tughral.
<lb/>On seeing him that wealthy thane grew pale
<lb/>As fenugreek with fear. A wise old man
<lb/>Was he, Barzin by name, but ill-affected
<lb/>Toward the Shah. As swift as wind he left

<lb/>The hauz,<note>1 See Vol. i. p. 208 note.</note> approached the Shah, and kissed the ground,
<lb/>Then said: <q>“O monarch of the sun-like face!
<lb/>May heaven revolve according to thy will.
<lb/>I do not dare to say to thee: ‘Abide
<lb/>With thy two hundred horsemen on my march.’
<lb/>Still, if the Shah take pleasure in my garden,
<lb/>The glory of Barzin hath reached the moon.”</q>
<lb/>“Today,” the world’s king answered, <q>“the tughral
<lb/>Escaped us. I am vexed about that fowler,
<lb/>Which hunted birds as leopards hunt their quarry.”</q>
<lb/>Barzin replied: <q>“I saw a sable bird
<lb/>Just now with golden bells and pitch-hued body,
<lb/>Its beak and talons turmeric in hue;
<lb/>It came and settled on yon walnut-tree:
<lb/>By thy good fortune it is come to hand.”</q>
<lb/>The Shah said to a servant: <q>“Go and look.”</q>
<lb/>He went like wind and cried: <q>“Glad ever be
<lb/>The world-lord! The tughral is on a bough;
<lb/>E’en now the falconer is taking it.”</q>
<lb/>The hawk thus found, the old man said: <q>“O Shah
<lb/>Without a mate or equal on the earth!
<lb/>Oh! may thine entertainer prove auspicious,
<lb/>And all the wearers of a crown thy slaves.”</q>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1519"/>
<lb/>Call for a wine-cup in our present joy,
<lb/>And, when thou art refreshed, ask what thou wilt.</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king of kings dismounted at the pool,
<lb/>And old Barzin grew glad. With that there came
<lb/>Bahram’s chief minister and therewithal
<lb/>The captains of the host and treasurer.
<lb/>Barzin brought forth a golden cup and first
<lb/>Drank to the monarch of the world, then brought
<lb/>And offered to the Shah a cup of crystal,
<lb/>Who seeing took and drained the proffered draught
<lb/>Below the inscription-line, whereat Barzin
<lb/>In high delight had wine-jars set about
<lb/>The place, and in his cups said to his daughters:—
<lb/><q>“My clever chicks! no chieftain of the host,
<lb/>But Shah Bahram hath visited this garden!
<lb/>So come, thou songstress! let us have a song,
<lb/>And thou, my moon-faced daughter! bring thy harp.”</q>
<lb/>All three drew near the Shah, and on their heads
<lb/>Were jewelled crowns. One danced, another played
<lb/>Upon the harp, the third possessed a sweet
<lb/>And soothing voice. While they made minstrelsy
<lb/>The king of kings in high contentment drained
<lb/>His goblet dry. He said thus to Barzin:—
<lb/><q>What girls are these who live with thee in joy?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Barzin thus answered him: <q>“O Shah! may none
<lb/>Behold the age without thee. Know that these
<lb/>Are mine own daughters and my heart’s delight.
<lb/>One is a caroler, another harpeth,
<lb/>The third observeth measure in the dance.
<lb/>I need not aught, O Shah! for I have money,
<lb/>Domain, and pleasure-ground, and my three daughters
<lb/>Are, as the Shah perceiveth, like glad spring.
<lb/>O moon-face!”</q> said he to the songstress, <q>“fear not,
<lb/>But sing a song about the Shah.”</q>
</p>
<p><lb/>The Idols
<pb n="52"/>
<lb/>Took heart to sing and play. The songstress sang:—
<lb/><q>O moon-faced king! the moon in heaven
<lb/>Alone is like to thee,
<lb/>The royal throne thine only seat.
<lb/>Thou with thy moon-like blee,
<lb/>And teak-like stature art the pride
<lb/>Of throne and crown. Oh! rare
<lb/>For those that see thy face at morn,
<lb/>For those that scent thy hair!
<lb/>Thy loins are tiger-like, thy limbs
<lb/>Are mighty, thy crown’s Grace
<lb/>Is as the cloud-rack high, and like
<lb/>Pomegranate-bloom thy face.
<lb/>For rapture of thy love hearts laugh,
<lb/>Like ocean is thine own;
<lb/>Like cloud thy hand. As thy fit prey
<lb/>I see the lion alone.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1520"/> Thou splittest with thy shaft a hair,
<lb/>And by thine equity
<lb/>Convertest water into milk.
<lb/>When hostile armies see
<lb/>Thy lasso and thy puissant arm
<lb/>Their hearts and brains are rent
<lb/>However mighty their array,
<lb/>Howe’er on battle bent.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, having heard the ditty, drained
<lb/>The massive crystal cup and thus addressed
<lb/>Barzin: <q>“O noble sir, experienced much
<lb/>Is this world’s heat and cold! thou wilt not find
<lb/>A better son-in-law than me who am
<lb/>"Mid kings a hero and the king of men.
<lb/>Bestow thy daughters on me—all the three—
<pb n="53"/>
<lb/>And I will raise thy coronet to Saturn.”</q>
<lb/><q>“O king!” Barzin replied, “may wine and bearer
<lb/>Find favour in thy sight. Who will dare say
<lb/>That he hath such a Venus in his house?
<lb/>If now thou wilt accept me as a slave
<lb/>To serve before the throne of king of kings
<lb/>Then will I pay my service to thy crown,
<lb/>Thy throne, thy Grace, thy fortune, and thy state;
<lb/>Moreover my three daughters are thy handmaids
<lb/>To stand before thee as thy slaves. The Shah
<lb/>Approved of them as such or ever he
<lb/>Saw these three Moons afar. As teaks are they
<lb/>In stature and as ivory in hue,
<lb/>Fit for the throne and to adorn the crown.
<lb/>Now will I tell the monarch of the world
<lb/>What fortune I possess for good and ill:
<lb/>Of clothes and carpets, stuffs and draperies,
<lb/>Good sooth have I stored up in mine abode
<lb/>Two hundred camel-loads or more as well
<lb/>As necklaces and bracelets, crowns and thrones,
<lb/>All for my daughters’ pleasure.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“Leave what thou hast in store,
<lb/>Where now it is, and seek mirth with the wine-cup.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The elder answered: <q>“My three moon-like daughters
<lb/>I give thee by the rites of Gayomart
<lb/>And of Hushang. Dust are they 'neath thy feet,
<lb/>And all the three live but to do thy will.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The eldest daughter’s name was Mah Afrid,
<lb/>The second’s Faranak, and the cadette’s
<lb/>Was Shambalid. Approving them at sight
<lb/>The Shah preferred them 'mongst his lawful wives,
<lb/>And bade a noble of his escort bring
<lb/>Four golden litters,<note>The fourth was for himself and needful. See below.</note> and, when all three Idols
<lb/>Were set therein, they were encircled there
<pb n="54"/>
<lb/>By forty Ruman slaves—their devotees—
<lb/>Who called down praises on them as they went,
<lb/>While they departed to their golden home
<lb/>The glorious Shah caroused. A servant hung
<lb/>His whip above the court-gate, for the escort,
<lb/>Save by the token of the whip, ne’er knew
<lb/>Where Shah and nobles were. When any one
<lb/>Beheld the handle and its lengthy thong
<lb/>He used to run thereto and do obeisance.
<lb/>Bahram drank on until he was bemused,
<lb/>Then gloriously took his seat within a litter,
<lb/>And went back to his women’s golden house—
<lb/>The house that was perfumed with ambergris.
<lb/>On his return he tarried for a week,
<lb/>And much he feasted, lavished, and held converse.
<lb/>The eighth day he went hunting with Ruzbih,
<lb/>And with a thousand cavaliers. He saw
<lb/>That all the plain was full of onager,
<lb/>Drew from its case his royal bow, and strung it,
<lb/>Invoking God who giveth victory.
<lb/>'Twas springtide and the onager were pairing.
<lb/>From all the world they met confronting there,
<lb/>And rent each other’s hides, the face of earth
<lb/>Was reddened with their blood. Bahram abode
<lb/>While two bucks fought together furiously,
<lb/>Then when the valiant buck that gained the day
<lb/>Was covering a doe he laughed to see
<lb/>The onagers, took hold upon his bow-string,
<lb/>Shot, piercing the buck’s flank so that the arrow
<lb/>Went home up to its plumes, and skewered buck
<lb/>And doe together, thrilling all his escort.
<lb/>All who beheld that shot acclaimed the Shah:—
<lb/><q>“Oh! be the evil eye far from thy Grace,
<lb/>And may thy whole life be a festival.
<lb/>Such might as thine the age ne’er saw till now;
<lb/>At once Shah, warrior, and king art thou.”</q>

<head>§ 14 How Bahram slew Lions, went to the House of a Jeweller, and married his Daughter</head>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, on urging thence his steed Shabrang,
<lb/>Came on a forest and beheld before it
<lb/>Two savage lions, strung and drew his bow.
<lb/>The arrow, striking on the lion’s breast,
<lb/>Was buried to the plumes. Forthwith Bahram
<lb/>Turned to the lioness and, shooting, pinned
<lb/>Her breast and loins together, but exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>“The shaft was featherless, the point was blunt,
<lb/>If point there were.”</q>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1522"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The escort praised him, saying:—
<lb/><q>O famous king of earth! none ever saw,
<lb/>Or will see, on the throne of king of kings
<lb/>A Shah like thee, who with unfeathered arrows
<lb/>O’erthrowest lions, and with plumed uprootest
<lb/>A mount of flint.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch with his meiny
<lb/>Rode on along the meadow-land and saw
<lb/>A forest full of sheep, their herds in flight
<lb/>For fear of harm. The chief herd, ne’er at ease
<lb/>For terror of wild beasts, perceived Bahram,
<lb/>Who said to him: <q>“What man is driving sheep
<lb/>To this unlikely spot?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The head man answered:—
<lb/><q>“Great sir! none cometh to this pasturage
<lb/>Except myself. They are a jeweller’s:
<lb/>I drove them from the mountains yesterday.
<lb/>The owner is a wealthy man not troubled
<lb/>By fear of loss. He owneth gems by ass-loads,
<lb/>Gold, silver, trinketry. He hath withal
<lb/>One only daughter, skilful on the harp.
<lb/>Her tresses cluster on her head in curls.
<pb n="56"/>

<lb/>He will take wine from her hand only. None
<lb/>Hath seen an old man like him. How could he
<lb/>Have kept his property but by the justice
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram? The great king of the world
<lb/>Is not concerned for gold, and his archmages
<lb/>Are not unjust; but say who slew these beasts,
<lb/>For may the Ruler of the world uphold him?”</q>

</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“This pair of lions fell
<lb/>Beneath the arrows of a valiant man,
<lb/>Who, having slain these gallant beasts, departed
<lb/>With seven other gallant cavaliers.
<lb/>Where is the jeweller’s mansion? Point the way,
<lb/>And hide it not from us.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The chief hind said:—
<lb/><q>“Proceed and thou wilt reach a brand-new seat.
<lb/>The jeweller thence fareth to the city,
<lb/>To Shah Bahram’s own palace, but, what time
<lb/>The sun doth don its Sable Silk, returneth
<lb/>To banquet. Revelling and sound of lyre
<lb/>Will reach thine ears if thou wilt bide a while.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram, on hearing this, called for his steed,
<lb/>And for apparel suited to a king,
<lb/>Then parted from his minister and escort.
<lb/>Good sooth! but he was full of eagerness!
<lb/>Ruzbih said to the chiefs: <q>“So now the Shah
<lb/>Is going to the village, there to knock
<lb/>Upon the portal of the jeweller!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1523"/>
<lb/>And, mark my words! will ask of him his daughter,
<lb/>And crown her doubtless with a crown of gold,
<lb/>Will take her to his ladies’ golden house,
<lb/>And send that other three back to Barzin!
<lb/>He never hath enough of chambering;
<lb/>His consort flitteth ere the night is over!
<lb/>He hath above a hundred ladies’ bowers!
<lb/>'Tis ill to have a king of kings like this.”</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Just now a eunuch reckoned up nine hundred
<lb/>And thirty damsels wearing jewelled crowns
<lb/>Within the palace, all provided for!
<lb/>The Shah demandeth tribute from all lands,
<lb/>And Rum will be exhausted in a year.
<lb/>Alack! for shoulders, breast, and height like his,
<lb/>And face that brightened all the company!
<lb/>None will behold his like in strength and stature,
<lb/>Who pinneth with one shaft two onagers;
<lb/>But dalliance with women marreth him,
<lb/>He soon will be as feeble as a ghost!
<lb/>His eyes will darken and his looks grow wan,
<lb/>His body slacken and his cheeks turn blue.
<lb/>To sniff at women maketh hoary heads,
<lb/>And hoary heads have naught to hope on earth.
<lb/>As polo-playing maketh stoop the upright,
<lb/>So womanizing causeth every ill.
<lb/>Once in a month is intercourse enough,
<lb/>While more is waste of blood. A wise youth too
<lb/>Should husband vigour for his children’s sake.
<lb/>In this excess there is excess of loss,
<lb/>And slackness is afflictive to a man.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They went back to the palace, talking still,
<lb/>And one remarked: <q>The Sun hath lost his way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, with one slave to mind his horse,
<lb/>Fared through the gloom of night and, when he neared
<lb/>The jeweller’s abode, heard sounds of harping,
<lb/>Whereto he urged Gulgun, his steed, forthwith
<lb/>Toward the merchant’s house. He knocked and asked
<lb/>Admittance, all the while invoking Him
<lb/>Who made the sun. A kindly handmaid said:—
<lb/><q>Who's there? Why knock thus at this time of night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>This morning as the Shah
<lb/>Was coming from the hunting-ground my horse
<lb/>Went lame, and I perforce got left behind.

<pb n="58"/>
<lb/>Here in this thoroughfare the folk will steal
<lb/>A steed like this and my gold harness too,
<lb/>So I need help.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The handmaid went and told
<lb/>Her lord: <q>“A man requesteth shelter, saying:
<lb/>'My steed with its gold harness will be stolen,
<lb/>And I shall go away undone.'”</q>
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/><q>“Then ope the door. Hast never seen a guest
<lb/>Come here before?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1524"/>
<lb/>The maid made haste to open,
<lb/>And said: <q>“Come in, my son!”</q>
<lb/>The Shah on entering,
<lb/>And seeing such a place and such attendance,
<lb/>Said to himself: <q>“O just and only God!
<lb/>Thou art Thy servant’s Guide to what is good.
<lb/>Ne’er may I be but just in conduct, never
<lb/>Be covetous and arrogance my creed,
<lb/>Let every act and deed of mine be just,
<lb/>And let my subjects’ hearts rejoice in me:
<lb/>Then, if my knowledge and my justice wax,
<lb/>My memory will shine when I am dead.
<lb/>May all my subjects, like this jeweller,
<lb/>Enjoy the sound of harp and revelry.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On entering the lofty hall he saw
<lb/>The jeweller’s famed daughter from the door.
<lb/>The thane, on seeing him, arose and came
<lb/>With bows profound, and said: <q>“Good ev’n to thee.
<lb/>May all thy foemen’s hearts be rooted out.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The host spread out a mat and laid thereon
<lb/>A cushion, gazing at his guest with joy.
<lb/>One brought a sumptuous board with viands hot
<lb/>And cold thereon. One came—a faithful liege—
<lb/>And was instructed to secure the steed.
<lb/>Elsewhere they lodged and fed Bahram Gar’s servant.
<lb/>They set a low seat for the host himself,
<pb n="59"/>
<lb/>Who took his place close to his guest the Shah,
<lb/>And then began to offer his excuse,
<lb/>Thus saying to Bahram: <q>“Brave paladin!
<lb/>Since thou art entertained within my house
<lb/>Conform thyself to my rough usages.
<lb/>When we have eaten we must drink and then
<lb/>Rest sweetly. ‘Tis dark night, the wine is royal;
<lb/>When thou hast drunk thy quantum thou shalt sleep,
<lb/>And, when thou wakest at the break of day,
<lb/>Must haste back to the service of the Shah.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“Night dark when one alighteth
<lb/>On cheery host like thee! We must not prove
<lb/>Ingrate to God; the hearts of thankless men
<lb/>Are full of fear.”</q>
<lb/>The handmaid, who was all
<lb/>Astonied at the aspect of the guest,
<lb/>Brought water, bowl, and napkin. Hands were washed,
<lb/>Then came the wine-cup’s turn, and with the wine
<lb/>Came mirth, contentment, and tranquillity.
<lb/>The handmaid brought a flagon and strong drink,
<lb/>Red wine, a cup, and flowers of fenugreek.
<lb/>The thane first reached out for the cup and drank,
<lb/>Then washed it out with musk and with rose-water,
<lb/>And gave the cup that cheereth to Bahram.
<lb/>“What,” said he, “is my boon-companion’s name?
<lb/>Now will I make a covenant with thee,
<lb/>And I will take Bahram, the Shah, as surety.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king laughed heartily thereat and said:—
<lb/><q>“Gushasp, the cavalier, am I, and hither
<lb/>Came I attracted by the sound of harp,
<lb/>And not to drink or while away the time.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“This girl of mine,” his host replied, <q>“exalteth
<lb/>My head to heaven and is at once my harper,
<lb/>And my cup-bearer, and withal she singeth,
<lb/>And dissipateth care. My Heart’s Delight
<lb/>Is named Arzi—my heart’s delight and server.”</q>

<pb n="60"/>

<lb/>He said to that tall Cypress: <q>“Bring thy harp,
<lb/>Come in thy loveliness before Gushasp.”</q>
<lb/>The harpist, tall as a pomegranate-tree,
<lb/>Moved stately to the king of kings and said:—
<lb/><q>“O chosen cavalier who hast in all
<lb/>The semblance of a king! know that this house
<lb/>Of feasting is thine own, my sire thy host
<lb/>And treasurer. May thy dark nights be joyous,
<lb/>And be thy head exalted o’er the rain-clouds.”</q>
<lb/>He said to her: <q>“Sit down, take up thy harp,
<lb/>And let us have a song immediately.
<lb/>To-night old Mahiyar shall be a youth,
<lb/>And pledge his soul as hostage for his guest.”</q>
<lb/>The harpist clasped her harp and first she played
<lb/>The Magians’ chant, and as the silken chords
<lb/>Rang out an odour as of jasmine filled
<lb/>The room. She sang to Mahiyar, her sire,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>“How plaintive is her harp!”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“Thou art as a cypress
<lb/>That lippeth a stream,
<lb/>And white locks encircle
<lb/>Thy cheeks’ rosy gleam.
<lb/>Thy tongue is warm-spoken,
<lb/>Thy heart loveth peace,
<lb/>Oh! ne’er may thy foemen
<lb/>Of ill have surcease.
<lb/>Thy soul’s food be wisdom.
<lb/>Thy bent is as great
<lb/>As Faridun’s. On thee
<lb/>As handmaid I wait.
<lb/>Arzi am I titled,
<lb/>I joy in our guest,
<lb/>Like monarch whose troops are
<lb/>With victory blest.”
</p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p>
<lb/>This ditty done, toward the guest she turned,
<lb/>Turned toward him with a song and plaintive chords:—
<lb/><q>Sincere and brave, high-starred and king-like one!
<lb/>They that ne’er saw Bahram, the cavalier,
<lb/>The well approved, to every bosom dear,
<lb/>Should look upon thy face, and all is done.
<lb/>His only semblance in the host thou art,
<lb/>Tall as a cypress with a reed-like waist,
<lb/>A cypress with a pheasant’s carriage graced,
<lb/>An elephant in bulk with lion’s heart.
<lb/>Two miles in fight thou flingest forth thy spear,
<lb/>Thy cheeks as though pomegranate-blossoms shine
<lb/>(Who was it washed, say’st thou, those blooms in wine?)
<lb/>And as a camel’s thighs thine arms appear.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1526"/>

<lb/>Thou tramplest Mount Bistan. Heaven toiled to mould
<lb/>A man like thee. None see I to compete
<lb/>In strife with thee. As dust beneath thy feet
<lb/>Oh! may Arzi’s form be while life shall hold.”</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The girl’s proficiency with song and harp,
<lb/>Her looks, her stature, and accomplishments,
<lb/>So wrought the world-lord that thou wouldst have said:—
<lb/><q>“His heart hath grown a magazine of woes,”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>And at the time when Mahiyar grew drunk
<lb/>Before him he addressed his host, thus saying:—
<lb/><q>“Give me thy daughter as my lawful wife
<lb/>If thou wouldst be commended for just dealing.”</q>
<lb/><q>“Wilt thou accept,”</q> said Mahiyar to her,
<lb/><q>“The presents of this lion-hearted man?
<lb/>See if he pleaseth thee, and if ’tis well
<lb/>For thee to go with him.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Arzi replied:—

<pb n="62"/>
<lb/><q>Good, noble father!<note>Reading with P.</note> if thou wouldst bestow me
<lb/>On any then my partner is Gushasp,
<lb/>The cavalier. One that doth look upon
<lb/>A man like this will bid Bahram ‘Avaunt!’</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>His daughter’s words misliked him and he said
<lb/>Thus to Bahram: <q>“O horseman of the fray!
<lb/>Regard her carefully from head to foot,
<lb/>Her industry, her knowledge, and discretion;
<lb/>See if she be approved of thee at heart;
<lb/>Report of her is better than assumption.
<lb/>She is at once accomplished and no beggar;
<lb/>I do not specify exact amounts,
<lb/>But shouldst thou count the gems of Mahiyar
<lb/>They would exceed those in the royal coffers.
<lb/>Be not precipitate, take rest to-night,
<lb/>And, if needs must, another cup of wine,
<lb/>For great men make no compacts in their cups
<lb/>Especially about their lady-loves.
<lb/>Wait therefore till the sun shall rise on high,
<lb/>And till the nobles’ heads have roused from sleep,
<lb/>Then will we call far-seeing elders—
<lb/>Disinterested men and scholarly.
<lb/>At night ’tis out of order and ignoreth
<lb/>The precedents of Faridun, the Shah.
<lb/>Ill-omened ’tis to marry in one’s cups
<lb/>Or handsel any business.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram:—
<lb/><q>“Absurd! ’Tis ill to draw, or go by, omens.
<lb/>This harpist pleaseth me to-night, so strive
<lb/>To deem the matter an auspicious one.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The sire said to his daughter: <q>“O Arza!
<lb/>Dost thou approve him as to looks and manners?”</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>“Yea, I approved of him when I
<lb/>Far off beheld him with such head and eyes.

<pb n="63"/>
<lb/>Complete the work and leave the rest to God:
<lb/>The sky is not at feud with Mahiyar.”</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Her father answered: <q>“Thou art now his wife.
<lb/>Know this that thou art under coverture.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1527"/>
<lb/>He gave her to Bahram Gur who espoused her;
<lb/>By dawn the matter had been consummate.
<lb/>The Shah’s attendant hung the royal whip
<lb/>Upon the door of Mahiyar, Arzi
<lb/>Went to her chamber while on every side
<lb/>Folk still were sleeping. Mahiyar departed
<lb/>To make all ready for the cavalier,
<lb/>Gushasp, and told a servant: <q>“Shut the doors,
<lb/>And send off someone to the flock in haste.
<lb/>They must not serve the board without a lamb,
<lb/>And one well fattened too. Wait on Gushasp,
<lb/>And, when he waketh, bring him ice and sherbet,<note>Fakké’. See Vol. i. p. 43 note.</note>
<lb/>Take too a bowl of camphor and rose-water
<lb/>To scent his chamber. As for me, my cups
<lb/>Have left me just as I was yesterday;
<lb/>Old jewellers shirk not their wine.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake,
<lb/>And, drawing up his cloak about his head,
<lb/>Wooed rest and sleep.
<lb/>When bright Sol showed its crown,
<lb/>And earth became like shining ivory,
<lb/>Troops armed with shields and double-headed darts
<lb/>Went to seek traces of the royal whip.
<lb/>The escort gathered round the door as though
<lb/>The Shah’s own court, and all that recognised
<lb/>The whip came forward and saluted it.
<lb/>The porter, seeing that great gathering,
<lb/>The throng of swordsmen and of javelin-men,
<lb/>Went, roused his sleeping lord, and sobered him,
<lb/>Thus saying to him: <q>“Rise, bestir thyself;
<lb/>This is no time to sleep or place to sit,
<lb/>Because the world’s king is thy guest within
<lb/>This sorry house of thine!”</q>
<pb n="64"/>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1528"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The jeweller’s heart
<lb/>Throbbed wildly at the words. He cried: <q>“What say'st thou?
<lb/>How tracest thou the footsteps of the king?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then fully realising what was said
<lb/>He sprang up from the bed-clothes with a shout,
<lb/>Enraged against the porter, <q>“These,”</q> he cried,
<lb/><q>“Are not the words of wisdom and of age.”</q>
<lb/><q>“Experienced man!”</q> the slave said, <q>“who on earth
<lb/>Made thee the monarch of Iran? So vast
<lb/>A host is at thy gate that, wouldst thou pass,
<lb/>There is scant room, and every Jack of them,
<lb/>On coming up, saluteth our old curtain!<note>The felt curtain at the door-way. Cf. p. 69.</note>
<lb/>At dawn, before the sun began to shine,
<lb/>The cavalier’s attendant came and hung
<lb/>A whip all gold and jewels o’er our entry,
<lb/>Where we pass through it, and round that long whip
<milestone unit="calced" n="1528"/>
<lb/>There is a world of folk from hill and dale.
<lb/>So now be up and doing, be not slack,
<lb/>And let not wine affect thee.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this,
<lb/>The shrewd old man was troubled: <q>“Why did I
<lb/>Get drunk last night before the king of kings,
<lb/>And let my daughter share the wine with us?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then going to the chamber of Arzi
<lb/>He said: <q>“My gracious Moon! it was Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, that last night visited
<lb/>The jeweller! On coming from the chase
<lb/>He hither turned his steed. Now up and don
<lb/>Brocade of Rum and set upon thy head
<lb/>Thy last night’s crown. Make him an offering
<lb/>Of jewels worthy of a king—three rubies
<lb/>Of royal worth—and, when thou shalt behold
<pb n="65"/>
<lb/>His sun-like face, enfold thine arms before him,
<lb/>Keep thine eyes fixed on him and think of him
<lb/>As thine own soul and body. Answer meekly
<lb/>When he shall question thee, and let thy words
<lb/>Be modest and discreet. I shall not come
<lb/>Unless he calleth me and giveth me
<lb/>A place among his followers. I sat
<lb/>At table with him like his peer! Oh! would
<lb/>That I had no bones in me! Furthermore
<lb/>I cottoned with the Shah when in my cups!
<lb/>Wine maketh old and young to misdemean.”</q>
<lb/>Just then a slave came hurrying and said:
<lb/><q>“The Shah, that ardent spirit, is awake.”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the Shah woke safe and sound, he went
<lb/>To bathe him in the garden, went to pray
<lb/>Before the sun, confiding all to God.
<lb/>Returning thence to the reception-room
<lb/>He bade a server bring a cup of wine,
<lb/>Heard that his retinue had come, dismissed it,
<lb/>And called Arzi on whom his heart was set.<note>Arzu means ‘Desire,’ and there is a double use of the word in the
<lb/>original: "Because he had a desire for Desire.”</note>
<lb/>Arzi appeared with wine and offerings—
<lb/>A handmaid with her necklace and her earrings—
<lb/>And with a lowly reverence kissed the ground.
<lb/>The Shah smiled on her greatly pleased and said:—
<lb/><q>“Whence such behaviour—first to make me drunk,
<lb/>Then run away? Thy song and harp suffice
<lb/>For me, a woman’s presents are for others.
<lb/>Come sing to me thy ditties of the chase,
<lb/>Of spearhead-blows, and royal combatings.”</q>
<lb/>Anon he said: <q>“Where is the jeweller,
<lb/>For we got drunk together yesternight?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The daughter, when she heard this, called her father,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1529"/>
<lb/>Mazed at the Shah’s good-nature. Came her sire
<lb/>With folded arms before the sun-like king





<pb n="66"/>
<lb/>Of kings, and said: <q>“O Shah! O chief! O wise!
<lb/>O great! O mighty one! O warrior!
<lb/>O archimage! may this world ever be
<lb/>At thy dispose and everywhere thy name
<lb/>Associate with the crown. The man that quaffeth
<lb/>The draught of foolishness should hold his tongue.
<lb/>My fault was due to ignorance. Methinks
<lb/>That thou must deem me mad. Vouchsafe to pardon
<lb/>My fault and make my face and faring bright.
<lb/>I stand—a foolish slave—before thy door;
<lb/>The king of kings will deem me less than man.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“The wise man never taketh
<lb/>The drunkard seriously; one should not eye
<lb/>Or savour wine if it make sad the face.
<lb/>I saw thee not ill-tempered in thy cups.
<lb/>Now listen to the singing of Arzu,
<lb/>And proffer as thine own apology
<lb/>The tulips and the jasmine of her song.
<lb/>Let her descant what while we quaff, not counting
<lb/>The ill of days not come.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He kissed the ground,
<lb/>Did Mahiyar, then brought and spread the board,
<lb/>And, good man that he was, he fetched withal
<lb/>The nobles that were stationed at the gate;
<lb/>Howbeit Arzi went off to her own bower,
<lb/>Her visage puckered at those stranger-guests,
<lb/>And stayed till heaven grew sombre, and the stars
<lb/>Came out around the moon. The eating done,
<lb/>Arzi was called and set upon a seat
<lb/>Of golden work. The Shah bade her to take
<lb/>Her harp and sing to him the song that he
<lb/>Had asked of her already. Thus she sang:—
<lb/><q>“O monarch undaunted! the lion in shame
<lb/>Will slink from the wood at the bruit of thy name.
<lb/>Shah, victor, host-breaker art thou. In thy mien
<pb n="67"/>
<lb/>The tints of the tulip on jasmine are seen.
<lb/>In stature no ruler on earth is thy peer,
<lb/>In looks thou transcendest the moon in her sphere.
<lb/>A host on the war-stead, beholding in fight
<lb/>Thy helmet, will rive, heart and brain, with affright,
<lb/>And longer discern not the depth from the height.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When they were blithe with wine and, eating done,
<lb/>Were quaffing draught on draught, Ruzbih appeared
<lb/>Before the Shah. They lodged him in the village.
<lb/>Ruzbih had brought a litter and withal
<lb/>Two score of eunuchs, all moon-faced and charming.
<lb/>Those Roman’s faces seemed brocade of Rum,
<lb/>And freshened all the country round. Arzi,
<lb/>A crown of jewels set upon her head,
<lb/>Toward the bower of Shah Bahram Gur sped.
</p>



<head>§ 15</head>
<lb/>How Bahram went to the Chase and passed the Night at the House of Farshidward
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1530"/>
<lb/>The king of kings, attended by Ruzbih,
<lb/>Went from the chief’s house with a gladsome heart.
<lb/>He passed the night and went at dawn to hunt.
<lb/>Troops fared o’er all the roads and trackless wastes,
<lb/>And thus abode a month. They pitched the tents
<lb/>And camp-enclosure, and swept all the field
<lb/>Of game. None slumbered there, it was all wine,
<lb/>Game, flesh, and harp, and lyre. They kindled fires
<lb/>About the plain and burned wood green and dry.
<lb/>There came a swarm of dealers from the city,
<lb/>Who tarried at the camp for trafficking:
<lb/>The crowd made bright the waste. At quarter price
<lb/>They bought one onager or ten gazelles,
<lb/>And whosoever was in want of meat,
<lb/>For cooking for his guests or for his children,
<pb n="68"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1531"/>
<lb/>Might carry home ground-game and water-fowl
<lb/>By ass-loads.
<lb/>When a month had passed Bahram
<lb/>Grew eager for his wives’ society,
<lb/>And led his people from the hunting-ground.
<lb/>Folk could not see the way, the cavaliers
<lb/>Raised such a dust! but swift as dust they sped
<lb/>Till day’s cheeks turned to Lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>The Shah observed a town in front of him
<lb/>With groups of houses, roadways, and bazaars,
<lb/>And ordered that his escort with the baggage
<lb/>Should push on, leaving not a soul behind.
<lb/>He asked: <q>“Where is the chief man of the place?”</q>
<lb/>And then made thither straightway. He beheld
<lb/>A shattered entry broad and deep. The owner
<lb/>Came and saluted him. The Shah inquired:—
<lb/><q>“Whose ruin is this and wherefore in such plight
<lb/>Amidst the town?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The master said: <q>“'Tis mine,
<lb/>And ill luck is my guide. I have not here
<lb/>Kine, raiment, victuals, manhood, understanding,
<lb/>No feet, no wings. Me thou hast seen, now view
<lb/>My house—one fitter for a curse than blessing.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The aspiring Shah alighted, scanned the house,
<lb/>And hands and feet both failed him, for the place
<lb/>Was all sheep's droppings though both great and vaulted!
<lb/><q>“Bring me,”</q> he said, <q>“thou hospitable man!
<lb/>Somewhat whereon to sit.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The other answered:—
<lb/><q>“Why mock thy host so wantonly, O marchlord!
<lb/>Had I some draperies my guest would praise me,
<lb/>But I have none, no clothing, food, or carpets.
<lb/>Pray lodge thee somewhere else; here all is poor.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>“Fetch a cushion then that I
<lb/>May sit awhile.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“The place is ill,” he answered.
<pb n="69"/>
<lb/><q>“Good sooth! wouldst thou have bird’s milk?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram:—
<lb/><q>“Bring fresh milk and new bread if thou canst get it.”</q>
<lb/><q>“Imagine,”</q> said the other, <q>“that thou hast
<lb/>Partaken and gone off with ‘Fare thee well.’
<lb/>I should not be so lifeless had I bread,
<lb/>Though life were better far than bread to me.”</q>
<lb/>Bahram said: <q>“If thou hast no sheep how come
<lb/>These droppings here?”</q>
<lb/>“'Tis night,” the other answered.
<lb/><q>“My head is all a muddle with thy talk.
<lb/>Select some mansion with a curtained entrance;
<lb/>The master of it will commend thy choice.
<lb/>Why shouldst thou be with an unfortunate,
<lb/>Who maketh leaves his pillow for the night?
<lb/>Thou hast a golden sword and stirrups, thou
<lb/>Shouldst sojourn not where there is fear of thieves,
<lb/>For thieves and lions haunt old hulks like this.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>“If a thief should rob me now
<lb/>Thou wouldst not be responsible, but give me
<lb/>A lodging for the night, 'tis all I need.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“Then need it not,” the owner made reply;
<lb/><q>“None lodgeth in my house.”</q>
<lb/>“O wise old man!
<lb/>Why art thou,” said the Shah, <q>“so short with me?
<lb/>Still thou wilt give me, I presume, cold water,
<lb/>O noble one!”</q>
<lb/>“Didst thou not see,” rejoined
<lb/>The householder, <q>“more than two bow-shots long<note>Or "hence. So Mohl.</note>
<lb/>The pool? There drink and take whate’er thou wilt.
<lb/>Why seek for aught in this impoverished house?
<lb/>Good sooth! hast never seen a poor man barred
<lb/>From working by decrepitude?”</q>
</p>
<lb/>Bahram
<lb/>Rejoined: <q>“Thou art not one of the first water,
<note n="1">Or “hence.” So Mohl.</note>
<pb n="70"/>
<lb/>Chief though thou be; so strive not with a soldier.
<lb/>What is thy name?”</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>“Farshidward,
<lb/>A man without land, raiment, sleep, and food.”</q>
<lb/>Bahram asked: <q>“Why endeavour not for provand
<lb/>And comfort?”</q>
<lb/>Said the master of the house:—
<lb/><q>“He that bestoweth all may end my days.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1532"/>

<lb/>If only I can see my desolation
<lb/>Relieved of thee I will make prayer to Him.
<lb/>Why cam’st thou to an empty house that never
<lb/>Saw good condition and a high estate?”</q>
<lb/>When he had spoken thus he wept so sorely
<lb/>That Shah Bahram fled from his cries. He laughed
<lb/>At that old man and took the road again,
<lb/>While all his escort followed in his train.

<lb/>How a Bramble-grubber revealed the Case of Farshidward, and
<lb/>how Bahram bestowed that Householder’s Wealth upon the
<lb/>Poor
<p>
<lb/>Bahram, on quitting that famed township, came
<lb/>Upon a bramble-brake. A man, who held
<lb/>A mattock in his hand, was grubbing there.
<lb/>The monarch left his retinue, drew near him,
<lb/>And said; <q>“O enemy of brambles! whom
<lb/>Know’st thou of most account in yonder town?”</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>“Farshidward—a man of greed
<lb/>That doth not suffer him to sleep or eat.
<lb/>He hath, may be, a hundred thousand sheep,
<lb/>More camels, steeds, and asses. Earth is full
<lb/>Of his amassed dinars, but would that he
<lb/>Had neither skin nor marrow to his body!
<pb n="71"/>
<lb/>- A famished paunch and nakedness are his;
<lb/>He hath no child, no kin, no friends, no goods.
<lb/>A captive in the hands of Greed and Need
<lb/>His person is all misery and wasted
<lb/>Through eating not, but if he were to sell
<lb/>For gold his tilth ’twould purchase gems enough
<lb/>To fill a house! His shepherds swill down flesh
<lb/>With milk, but he himself hath millet-bread
<lb/>Without e’en cheese! He never saw two coats
<lb/>At once; he is a tyrant to himself.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said to the grubber: <q>“Thou dost know
<lb/>The number of his sheep, but knowest thou
<lb/>Where those flocks are and likewise where his steeds
<lb/>And camels are at large?”</q>
<lb/>The grubber said:—
<lb/><q>“O thou! it is not far from here to where
<lb/>His camels and his sheep are, but my heart
<lb/>Is troubled at the ill that he may do me.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur gave the grubber some dinars,
<lb/>And said: <q>“This day shall gentle thy condition.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He bade one of his escort come to him,
<lb/>A man that knew his way about, by name
<lb/>Bihruz, a horseman brave and popular,
<lb/>And sent with him a hundred cavaliers,
<lb/>Selected men well suited to the work.
<lb/>He chose withal a scribe, an honest man
<milestone unit="calced" n="1533"/>
<lb/>And skilled accountant. <q>“Go,”</q> he told the grubber,
<lb/><q>“Thou didst grub brambles, now reap gold. One hundredth
<lb/>Of all that wealth is thine. Show to these men
<lb/>The way.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The grubber’s name was Dilafruz,
<lb/>A man of stately mien and stalwart form.
<lb/>Bahram bestowed on him a noble steed,
<lb/>And said: <q>“Thou must companion with the wind.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He was the Light of hearts but he became
<pb n="72"/>
<lb/>The Lustre of the world<note>He was, i.e. his name was, Dilafruz, but he became Gitiafruz.</note> and carried out
<lb/>His task triumphantly. He led the troop
<lb/>O’er hill and plain past countless flocks of sheep.
<lb/>Upon the mountains were ten caravans
<lb/>Of camels, each with its own caravaneer.
<lb/>The scribe wrote down of draught and of milch cattle
<lb/>Twelve thousand, and the number of the camels
<lb/>And steeds as twice ten thousand. All the waste
<lb/>Was dinted with their hoofs. Beside the stream
<lb/>There were three hundred thousand camel-loads
<lb/>Of potted butter and curds fresh and dried.<note>For winter use.</note>
<lb/>Height, waste, and level were one mighty cache,
<lb/>But none had heard thereof. Bihruz, the son
<lb/>Of Har, reported to the king of kings,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, praising first almighty God,
<lb/>The All-victorious and All-nourisher,
<lb/>And next the king of kings who had released
<lb/>Men’s hands from toil, and then proceeded thus:—
<lb/><q>“O monarch of the world! thou art the joy
<lb/>Of all folk great and small because thy justice
<lb/>Surpasseth bounds. Our treasury hath suffered
<lb/>Through silence as to this man’s wealth. ‘Tis well
<lb/>That all things in the world should have their bounds,
<lb/>Well that the Shah be boundlessly rejoiced.
<lb/>A wretch there is named Farshidward, unknown
<lb/>In feast and fight to great and small alike
<lb/>Throughout the world, not fearing God or Shah,
<lb/>And thankless in respect of what he hath.
<lb/>While thus he streweth o’er the world his wealth
<lb/>He is a lack-all, wretched, secretive,
<lb/>Who is as unjust as the Shah is just.
<lb/>Blame not my words and counsel. Let this wealth
<lb/>Inaugurate a treasury; ‘twill need




<pb n="73"/>
<lb/>Three years to order it. I have invoked
<lb/>To mine assistance certain other scribes,
<lb/>And settled them upon this fertile mount,
<lb/>But, though the writers’ backs are bent, not yet
<lb/>Is manifest the sum of this man’s treasure;
<lb/>Moreover he possesseth, so folk say,
<lb/>Still greater buried hoards of gold and jewels.
<lb/>Here in the mountain am I with both eyes
<lb/>Upon the road to know the Shah’s commands.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1534"/>
<lb/>My salutation to him. May he live
<lb/>What while his name is all in all to all.</q><note>Lit. "is (both) warp and woof."</note>
<lb/>He sent a cameleer post haste to bear
<lb/>The letter to the Shah. Whenas Bahram Gur
<lb/>Had read it he was troubled in his heart,
<lb/>Grew downcast, wept, and bent his warrior-brows.
<lb/>He called for Raman pens and silk of Chin,
<lb/>And bade a scribe approach. He first gave thanks
<lb/>To God almighty, the omniscient Guide,
<lb/>“The Lord of knowledge and of Grace, the Lord
<lb/>Of diadem and kingship,” then wrote thus:—
<lb/><q>“'T should by rights attach this man. He hath not
<lb/>Amassed these hoards by thievery and bloodshed,
<lb/>Hath not incited others to do wrong,
<lb/>But he hath been ungrateful and not had
<lb/>The fear of God within him, hath kept ward
<lb/>O’er all this treasure to the detriment,
<lb/>By such amassing, both of heart and soul.
<lb/>Wolf is as good as sheep upon yon plain
<lb/>Since neither yieldeth profit or return.
<lb/>A buried gem is nothing but a stone,
<lb/>Affording no one either food or raiment.
<lb/>We shall not found a treasury on his toils,
<lb/>Or fix our heart upon this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>Evanished from the world are Faridin,
<lb/>Iraj withal, Tar, and, amidst the mighty,
<pb n="74"/>
<lb/>Sam, Shah Kaus, and Kai Kubad, besides
<lb/>The other potentates whose names we cherish,
<lb/>And mine own sire who filled my heart with pain
<lb/>As being neither just nor generous.
<lb/>None of these great men is in evidence;
<lb/>Herein there is no striving with the Lord.
<lb/>Collect this treasure and distribute it,
<lb/>But touch not thou one hair. To every one
<lb/>That hideth his necessities and looketh
<lb/>Long vainly for remission from his ills;
<lb/>To old men past their work and despicable
<lb/>In rich men’s eyes; to those that have spent all,
<lb/>And now in trouble breathe forth chilling sighs;
<lb/>To those that have renown but not dinars;
<lb/>To traders reft of friends; to little ones
<lb/>Whom thou beholdest orphans, their sires dead,
<lb/>And they themselves in want of gold and silver;
<lb/>To women that have neither spouse nor raiment,
<lb/>That know no handicraft and no employment,
<lb/>Give all these treasures and irradiate
<lb/>The lives of those poor souls. This done, neglect not
<lb/>The hidden treasures, but bestow the hoards
<lb/>Of Farshidward upon the mendicants
<milestone unit="calced" n="1535"/>
<lb/>For their relief. Dinars and gems are dust
<lb/>To him since he must needs go bury them.
<lb/>May turning heaven be thy companion,
<lb/>All justice mayst thou be and self-restraint.”</q>
<lb/>They set the Shah’s seal on the document,
<lb/>And thereupon the courier turned and went.
</p>

<head>§ 17 How Bahram went to the Chase and slew Lions</head>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram bade slaves set up the imperial throne
<lb/>Within the pleasance, then in spring-tide beauty.
<pb n="75"/>
<lb/>They brought the turquoise throne at his command,
<lb/>And set it ‘neath a blossom-shedding tree,
<lb/>They brought forth wine and cups, and minstrels went
<lb/>Toward the pleasance with the chiefs. The king
<lb/>Said to his counsellors: <q>“This is the time
<lb/>Of jollity for men. We all must couch;
<lb/>Death treadeth under foot the rolls of fame,
<lb/>The hall and palace. We shall have enough
<lb/>Of our own company within the charnel,
<lb/>Men both of mien and stature though we be.
<lb/>The king and beggar carry when they die
<lb/>Naught but their good and ill away with them.
<lb/>What toil soe’er men bear is only loss,
<lb/>For, when they perish, that will perish too.
<lb/>That praise of us remaineth is enough,
<lb/>For crown and girdle are another’s share.
<lb/>Thou needest innocence and uprightness
<lb/>That thine enjoyments prove not scath to thee.
<lb/>My years exceed already eight and thirty,
<lb/>And many a day hath fleeted in delight,
<lb/>But, after two score years, grief for the day
<lb/>Of death is instant with us. If one hair
<lb/>Turn white upon our heads we must forgo
<lb/>All hope of joy; when musk becometh camphor
<lb/>‘Tis ruined; camphor suiteth not the crown.
<lb/>Two years more will I spend in feast and sport,
<lb/>Then, when my strength is somewhat broken, go
<lb/>Before God’s presence, don the woollen robe,
<lb/>And be not thankless for His mercies to me,
<lb/>For I have passed my days in joy and had
<lb/>My share of royal crown. Now for the rose,
<lb/>The apple, the pomegranate, and the quince!
<lb/>Let not the golden goblet fail of wine!


<note>1 The Emperor Babar (A.D. 1483-1530) in his diary made similar
good resolutions, which he did not keep: <quote>As I intend, when forty
years old, to abstain from wine ; and as I now want somewhat less than
one year of being forty, I drink wine most copiously.</quote> EHI, iv. 226.</note>
<pb n="76"/>


<lb/>But when I see the apples amber-cheeked,
<lb/>The heavens dappled like a leopard’s back,
<lb/>The fragrant camomile producing seed,
<lb/>And wine as ruddy as the reveller,
<lb/>When air is pleasant, neither hot nor cold,
<lb/>Earth fresh and water blue, what time we don
<lb/>Our autumn furs, I must to Jaz to hunt,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1536"/>
<lb/>And hold a hunting-bout upon that plain
<lb/>To make me a memorial in the world.
<lb/>Meanwhile the onager will grow plump-necked,
<lb/>And compass lion’s heart and tiger’s strength.
<lb/>We must take dogs and cheetahs, hawks and falcons,<note n="1">Two sorts of falcons are mentioned in the text—the charkh and
<lb/>the shéhin (falco sacer and falco peregrinator?).</note>
<lb/>For that far faring since it is the spot
<lb/>For onager and archery, and there
<lb/>No moment will we rest from chevying.
<lb/>The plain that I have set mine eyes upon
<lb/>Is lower Jaz. There tamarisks are tall
<lb/>As spear-shafts, there too we shall find the lion,
<lb/>And have a hunting if we bide our time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He waited till the clouds of Shahrivar
<lb/>Arose, then all the world was filled with troops.
<lb/>From every clime an army keen for strife
<lb/>Set face toward the monarch of Iran,
<lb/>Who chose among them chiefs of note as hunters,
<lb/>And carried with him to the chase a force
<lb/>Of thirty thousand mounted Scimitars.
<lb/>They took with them pavilions, tent-enclosures,
<lb/>Tents, beasts, and shielings, while the underlings
<lb/>Went on before Bahram Gar to dig wells,
<lb/>To furnish them withal with wheel and bucket,
<lb/>And run the water into troughs. The Shah
<lb/>Came later with his meiny to the chase.
<lb/>He saw the plain well stocked with onager,
<lb/>The woods alive with lions, and thus said:—

<pb n="77"/>

<lb/><q>Wine is our quarry to-night, for on the sand
<lb/>Are many lion-tracks, and we must have
<lb/>A lion-hunt to-morrow. Rest ye then
<lb/>In health of body and in merry pin,
<lb/>And let us drink till daybreak, till the sun—
<lb/>The lustre of the world—is bright again.
<lb/>Our scimitars shall fell the lions first,
<lb/>Shall fell those valiant dragons. When the woods
<lb/>Are cleared of lions then the onager
<lb/>Shall yield himself a servant to my shafts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He stayed that night and, when the morning dawned,
<lb/>Approached the forest with his men, whereat
<lb/>A lion, lusty-grown with battening
<lb/>On onagers, rushed forth, and brave Bahram
<lb/>Said to his friends: "Though I have bow and arrows,
<lb/>And mastery therewith, I will assail
<lb/>Yon lion with the scimitar that none
<lb/>May call me coward."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Donning a shrunk vest
<lb/>Of wool he mounted on his battle-steed.
<lb/>Now when that dragon of a lion saw him
<lb/>It reared, brought down its claws, and sought to strike
<lb/>The charger on the head.<note n="1">Blanford describes a lioness attacking his horse much in this way,
<lb/>and remarks that Persian sporting pictures generally represent the lion
<lb/>as leaping, not rearing. EP, ii. 32.</note> The warrior heeled
<lb/>His steed and with his trenchant scimitar,
<lb/>What while the lioness made off apace,

<milestone unit="calced" n="1537"/>
<lb/>Struck at the lion’s head and clave the beast
<lb/>Down to its middle, filling lions’ hearts
<lb/>With fear; yet gallantly another one
<lb/>Came roaring, one whose mate was suckling cubs.
<lb/>He smote that lion’s neck and parted head
<lb/>From trunk. One said to him: "O sun-faced Shah!
<lb/>Hast thou not any mercy on thyself?
<lb/>The wood is full of lions and their young—

<pb n="78"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Cubs that are sucklings. Let the lions be,
<lb/>For in the autumn-time they breed. This forest
<lb/>Is three leagues deep, and if thou wert to spend
<lb/>A year in taking lions wouldst not clear it;
<lb/>So why impose such labour on thyself?
<lb/>The Shah, when first he sat upon the throne,
<lb/>Fought lions only as the compact was.<note n="1">See Vol. vi. p. 405 seq.</note>
<lb/>Now thou art Shah, the world is thine, so why
<lb/>Fight with them still? Thou came’st for onager."
<lb/>"Old sage," the Shah said, "let to-morrow dawn,
<lb/>And heigh for onager and shaft and me!
<lb/>But cavaliers and nobles now alive
<lb/>Can rival me in archery, so when
<lb/>We give its due to manhood we must take
<lb/>Account of iron mace and scimitar."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage said: "Hadst thou ten horsemen with thee,
<lb/>And like thee in the fight, then Rum and Chin
<lb/>Would have no crown and throne, and men of wisdom
<lb/>Would ship their goods off. Be the evil eye
<lb/>Far from thy Grace, and be it thine to feast
<lb/>Among the roses."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then with archimages,
<lb/>And captains of the host, the Shah departed
<lb/>Toward his tent-enclosure from the wood
<lb/>What while the troops acclaimed him, saying thus:—
<lb/>"Ne’er may the crown and signet-ring lack thee."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That paladin then entered his pavilion,
<lb/>His escort quitting him, and washed his hands
<lb/>Of sweat. He had with him a trusty steward,
<lb/>Who draped a fresh tent for him. There they set
<lb/>Musk, camphor, and rose-water, and spread musk
<lb/>Withal upon the sleeping-place. Each tent
<lb/>Had golden tables laid with services
<lb/>Of ware of Chin where lamb and other meats

<pb n="79"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Were served by the chief server. Shah Bahram Gur,
<lb/>The eating done, called for a mighty cup
<lb/>Of crystal, which a fairy-faced cup-bearer
<lb/>Brought and consigned it to the just king’s hands,
<lb/>Who said: <q>“Ardshir, the great king, he whose fortune
<lb/>Made old folk young, was founder of our house,
<lb/>And we are underlings if we be worthy
<lb/>E’en of that title. Both in fight and feast,
<lb/>At counsel and at board, give none but him
<lb/>The title of world’s lord. What time Sikandar
<milestone unit="calced" n="1538"/>
<lb/>Came to Iran from Rum and wrecked the land,
<lb/>Since he was both ungenerous and harsh,
<lb/>And slew kings six and thirty, monarchs’ lips
<lb/>Are full of curses, and earth’s surface full
<lb/>Of vengeance, on him. Faridan they praise,
<lb/>And he is cursed by stirrers up of strife.
<lb/>Throughout the world may only good proceed
<lb/>From me to small and great. Bring me a herald,”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He added, <q>“one of goodly voice and leading,
<lb/>Let him go round the host and thus proclaim
<lb/>O’er way and waste alike: 'Whoe’er shall lay
<lb/>Within the region of Barkth and Jaz
<lb/>Unlawful hands on aught, from jewels, gold,
<lb/>Dinars, and furs to mean and worthless chaff,
<lb/>Him will I horse face tail-wards and will have
<lb/>Two of the soldiery to lead him hence.
<lb/>His feet shall be made fast beneath his steed,
<lb/>And to the temple of Azargashasp
<lb/>Will I dispatch him there to supplicate
<lb/>All-holy God and worship in the dust
<lb/>Before the Fire. I will bestow his goods
<lb/>On those whom he hath robbed and wronged withal.
<lb/>If any horse shall injure growing crops,
<lb/>Or harm fruit-bearing trees, the horse’s owner,
<pb n="80"/>
<lb/>Be he a noble or of no account,
<lb/>Shall not escape a year’s imprisonment.
<lb/>My work is but to carry from the desert
<lb/>My portion, then go home again rejoicing.'”</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The more part of the traffickers of Jaz,
<lb/>And of Barkth, went out upon the plain,
<lb/><lb/>And with their various packs produced a scene
About the host like a bazar in Chin.

</p>

<head>§ 18</head>
<p>
<lb/>How Bahram went to hunt the Onager, showed his Skill before
<lb/>the Princes, and returned to Baghdad and Istakhr
<lb/>Whenas the sun next day displayed its crown
<lb/>The world-lord went to hunt the onager;
<lb/>The soldiers strung their bows, the Shah himself
<lb/>Rode in the rear. He said: <q>“If one should take
<lb/>His bow to shoot at any beast the arrow
<lb/>Should strike the buttocks and come through the breast.”</q>
<lb/>A paladin replied: <q>“O king! consider
<lb/>Who in this noble host can shoot like that
<lb/>Among thy friends or foes unless indeed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1539"/>

<lb/>Thou shoot in person. May thy head and crown
<lb/>For ever live. When thou tak’st mace and arrow,
<lb/>And scimitar, thy warriors are awe-struck
<lb/>At thy commanding height and royal Grace,
<lb/>While other archers’ hands lose all their strength.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>"'Tis of God. If He withdraw it,
<lb/>What strength hath then Bahram?"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He urged Shabdiz,
<lb/>And, nearing a buck onager, let fly
<lb/>His arrow, when the moment came, and skewered
<lb/>Together chest and buttock. As it died
<pb n="81"/>
<lb/>The nobles of the golden belt came up;
<lb/>They marvelled at his shot, and all applauded,
<lb/>They could not see the arrow’s point and feathers,
<lb/>For they were hidden in the onager.
<lb/>The warlike cavaliers and soldiers bent
<lb/>With faces to the ground before Bahram,
<lb/>What while a paladin exclaimed: <q>"O king!
<lb/>Ne’er may thine eye behold the ill of fortune.
<lb/>Thou art a horseman but all we ride asses,
<lb/>And are but ill at that!"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah replied:—
<lb/><q>"Not mine the arrow, for the All-conqueror
<lb/>Assisteth me. None in the world is viler
<lb/>Than one whose prop and helper God is not."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He urged his charger onward, thou hadst said:—
<lb/><q>"Yon courser is an eagle in its flight!"</q>
<lb/>A gallant onager appeared. Forthwith
<lb/>The Lion reached out for his scimitar,
<lb/>And with a sword-stroke clave the beast asunder
<lb/>In equal halves. Chiefs, nobles, and attendants
<lb/>Armed with the scimitar, came up to him,
<lb/>And, when they saw that stroke, a sage exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>"What swordsmanship and might are here! Oh! may
<lb/>The evil eye ne’er look upon this Shah.
<lb/>He hath no semblance save the moon in heaven,"</q>
<note n="1">"il ne laissera peut-être pas la lune dans le ciel." Mohl.</note>
<lb/>Beneath him are the heads of this world’s chiefs,
<lb/>While heaven is lower than his scimitar,
<lb/>And arrow-point."
<lb/>The troops that followed him
<lb/>Cleared all the plain of onager. He bade
<lb/>Make rings of gold and grave his name thereon.
<lb/>He ringed the creatures’ ears and let them go;
<lb/>Six hundred too he branded in a batch,
<lb/>Then freed them for the honour of his name,
<lb/>And for his will and pleasure, while a man
<pb n="82"/>
<lb/>Went round the host proclaiming thus: <q>"Let none
<lb/>Sell to the merchants any onagers
<lb/>On this broad plain but give them as a gift."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They brought him from Barkah and from the chiefs
<lb/>Of Jaz abundance of brocade and furs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1540"/>
<lb/>These he accepted and then bade remit
<lb/>Those countries’ tax and toll though both could pay.
<lb/>Their poor and those that earned their bread grew rich
<lb/>By reason of his bounty. Many too
<lb/>Had thrones and crowns. He went home from the chase,
<lb/>And passed a week in mirth among his men.
<lb/>It was his wont to hold an open court
<lb/>Upon the riding-ground, and thither used
<lb/>To fare the troops, the men of eloquence,
<lb/>The wise, the needy, and the suppliants.
<lb/><q>"O ye that seek your rights!"</q> he used to say,
<lb/><q>"Take shelter from your enemies with God,
<lb/>While ye that have not slept through toil for me,
<lb/>And yet have had no portion of my wealth,
<lb/>Come to the king upon the riding-ground,
<lb/>And haply he will make your fortunes new.
<lb/>If any one is old, past work, and weak,
<lb/>Or, being young, is crippled by disease;
<lb/>If any of the people be in debt,
<lb/>And worried by the stress of creditors;
<lb/>If any children are left fatherless,
<lb/>And yet ask not of those possessed of wealth;
<lb/>Or if the children’s mothers are in want
<lb/>In secret and conceal their poverty;
<lb/>Or if, again, a wealthy man hath died,
<lb/>And left behind young children in this land,
<lb/>Whom an executor, devoid of fear
<lb/>And reverence for God, is plundering,
<lb/>Keep nothing of this kind concealed from me;
<lb/>I want not people that conceal their wants.
<pb n="83"/>
<lb/>I will enrich the poor, I will restore
<lb/>The souls of misbelievers to the Faith;
<lb/>I will defray the debts of those who have
<lb/>No money and whose hearts are sad, and open
<lb/>My treasury’s door to modest indigence.
<lb/>If wrong befall from officers of mine
<lb/>Defrauding children that have lost their sires,
<lb/>Those doers of injustice will I gibbet
<lb/>Alive for wronging one of noble race."</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>The Shah, advanced in wisdom and glad-hearted,
<lb/>Went from the hunting-field toward Baghdad,<note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 254.</note>
<lb/>And to his presence came the haughty chiefs,
<lb/>Both alien and those akin to him.
<lb/>He bade his retinue disperse and sought
<lb/>His own delightsome palace. They adorned
<lb/>The bower of Barzin, the handmaids there
<lb/>Were clamorous for musk and wine, the Idols
<lb/>Got ready song and harp, the hall was cleared
<lb/>Of strangers. What with harp and wine and pipe,
<lb/>And sound of song, the vaulted heaven seemed
<lb/>To greet the air. All night from every chamber
<lb/>They brought forth bands of dancers that the Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1541"/>
<lb/>Might be not sad of heart. He spent two weeks
<lb/>In mirth, and oped his treasury day and night,
<lb/>Gave largess, and departed for Istakhr,
<lb/>Placed on his head the glorious, royal crown,
<lb/>Unlocked the bower of Kharrad, and furnished
<lb/>The Idols there with treasure and with drachms.
<lb/>If any in that golden women’s house
<lb/>Had not a crown aloft an ivory throne
<lb/>The monarch of Iran growled mightily,
<lb/>Bit at Razbih his lip in indignation,
<lb/>And said: <q>"The tribute from Khazar and Ram
<lb/>I give, when paid, to these, but for the nonce
<lb/>Now requisition ass-loads of dinars,
<pb n="84"/>
<lb/>And treasure-loads from Ispahan and Rai.
<lb/>A women’s house when in such case as this
<lb/>Will grow all desolate and not befit
<lb/>The fortunes of the monarch of Iran."</q>
<lb/>They spread brocade upon the floor, and caused
<lb/>Fresh tribute to be paid in every land.
<lb/>The world thus passed awhile an easy life—
<lb/>No war, no toil, no conflict, and no strife.
</p>

<head>§ 19 How the Khan of Chin led forth a Host to war with Bahram, and how the Iranians asked Quarter of the Khan and submitted to him</head>
<p>

<lb/>Anon news came to Hind, Rum, Turkistan,
<lb/>Chin, and all parts inhabited: <q>"The heart
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram is given up to sport,
<lb/>He taketh no account of any one,
<lb/>He hath no outposts, no men are on guard,
<lb/>And on the marches are no paladins.
<lb/>For love of sport he suffereth all to drift,
<lb/>And knoweth nothing of the world’s affairs."</q>
<lb/>Now when the Khan of Chin heard this he levied
<lb/>Troops from Khutan and Chin, paid them, and set
<lb/>His face toward Iran. No one took thought
<lb/>About Bahram while Caesar for his part
<lb/>Marched forth in force from Rum. When tidings reached
<lb/>Iran from Rum and Hind, from Chin and all
<lb/>The settled regions: <q>"Caesar hath assembled
<lb/>And led an army forth while troops are seen
<lb/>Advancing from Khutan and Chin,"</q> the chieftains,
<lb/>The warriors old and young within Iran,
<lb/>All came before Bahram Gur, full of wrath,
<lb/>Of rage, and bitterness, and bluntly said:—
<pb n="85"/>
<lb/><q>"Thy glorious fortune hath displayed its back.
<lb/>The heads of kings should be intent on fighting,
<lb/>But thy heart is intent on sport and feasting;
<lb/>The crown and throne are worthless in thine eyes,
<lb/>So are Iran, the treasure, and the host.”</q></p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1542"/>    


<p>
<lb/>The Shah, the ruler of the world, thus answered
<lb/>Those archimages, his admonishers:—
<lb/><q>"My helper is the Master of the world,
<lb/>One who is wiser than the wisest sages.
<lb/>I by the conquering virtue of great kings
<lb/>Will guard Iran against the claws of Wolves;
<lb/>By fortune, host, wealth, scimitar will I
<lb/>Avert this pain and travail from the realm."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He toyed on just the same, his nobles’ eyes
<lb/>Were full of blood through him, and all folk said:—
<lb/><q>"This Shah will alienate all good men’s hearts."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Yet Shah Bahram’s heart was awake and full
<lb/>Of trouble at the tidings. Secretly
<lb/>He organised the host while folk at large
<lb/>Knew not his privy purpose. All Iran
<lb/>Was in dismay at what they saw of him;
<lb/>Their hearts were riven by anxiety;
<lb/>They all were in despair about the king,
<lb/>And held his rule and person in contempt.
<lb/>Now when the Khan was drawing nigh Iran,
<lb/>News of him reached the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>Who called to him the aspiring Gustaham,
<lb/>And spake much of the Khan and of his host.
<lb/>This Gustaham was paladin in chief,
<lb/>And minister, and fight came as a feast
<lb/>To him. The Shah called Mihr Piruz withal,
<lb/>Son of Bihzad, he called too Mahyar Barzin,
<lb/>Son of Kharrad, Bahram, son of Piruz,
<lb/>Son of Bahram, Ruhham and Kharzarwan,
<lb/>Which twain were of Sasanian lineage,
<lb/>One king of Rai, and of Gilan the other,
<pb n="86"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Who stood up stoutly on the day of battle,
<lb/>With Rad, son of Barzin, approved in fight,
<lb/>Who was the ruler of Zabulistan,
<lb/>Karan too and Burzin and Dara the grim,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, while of the Iranians
<lb/>He chose him out a hundred thousand men,
<lb/>Men of discretion, well beseen in war,
<lb/>Committing to a scion of the race
<lb/>In power—Narsi, the brother of the Shah
<lb/>So pure of Faith—those cavaliers and throne
<lb/>And crown that he might guard the treasury
<lb/>And realm. Narsi, that man of noble mien,
<lb/>Possessed of Grace and Faith and loving looks,
<lb/>Took up the charge, and thereupon the Shah
<lb/>Chose from the host twelve thousand cavaliers
<lb/>Fit for the day of battle—veterans
<lb/>With ox-head maces and in coats of mail—
<lb/>And marched thence to Azarabadagan;
<lb/>But, as he took from Pars so small a host,
<lb/>The mighty and the common folk alike
<lb/>Thought: "Shah Bahram is fleeing from the fight,
<lb/>And making off toward Azargashasp."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>What time Bahram set face toward the Fire
<lb/>From Caesar came an envoy swift as wind.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1543"/>
<lb/>Narsi received and lodged him fittingly
<lb/>Within the palace.
<lb/>Now the host approached
<lb/>The high priest to get knowledge of Bahram,
<lb/>And said: "Why scattereth he his treasures thus
<lb/>Instead of heaping them like other Shahs?
<lb/>He squandereth gold everywhere because
<lb/>He knoweth not its worth. Both citizens
<lb/>And soldiers are dispersed, and all have sought
<lb/>Some course of betterment."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>At length, when words
<lb/>Had waxen old, all folk agreed to send
<pb n="87"/>
<lb/>A man of reputation to the Khan
<lb/>Of Chin, <q>"Because,"</q> said they, <q>"'ere evils come
<lb/>With war and pillage we must try all means
<lb/>To save Iran: the master of the house
<lb/>Is lost."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Narsi replied: <q>"This is not well;
<lb/>The world hath not a bed for such a stream.
<lb/>Shall I ask quarter of the king of Chin?
<lb/>I will clothe earth with men and elephants.
<lb/>There are arms, treasure, and courageous men,
<lb/>Whose swords would send dust out of fire itself.
<lb/>Why this despair concerning Shah Bahram
<lb/>Because he started with a little band?
<lb/>Why have your thoughts turned evil thus? If ye
<lb/>Think ill then ill will come."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Iranians heard,
<lb/>And answered him perversely, saying: <q>"Bahram,
<lb/>Departing hence, took not a host with him,
<lb/>And must we not resign our hearts to grief,
<lb/>For when the Khan shall come to fight Iran
<lb/>Our land will lose both scent and hue? The foe
<lb/>Will trample on us shamefully, Narsi
<lb/>And all the host will be o’erthrown. All means
<lb/>Will we endeavour to maintain our place
<lb/>And standing here."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>There was an archimage,
<lb/>A skilful, learned, single-hearted man,
<lb/>Humai by name, and him the Iranians chose
<lb/>To gird his loins and undertake their cause,
<lb/>Then wrote the Khan upon their own behalf
<lb/>A cringing letter which began: <q>"Thy slaves
<lb/>Are we and bow down to thy will and pleasure.
<lb/>We send thee of the produce of Iran
<lb/>Together with our homage and excuses,
<lb/>With gifts too, toll and tribute, for we have
<lb/>No power to stand against the king in war."</q>
<pb n="88"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So from Iran the blest Humai arrived
<lb/>With certain nobles—men of honest counsels—
<lb/>And gave the Khan the message of the chiefs,
<lb/>Whereat his heart rejoiced. Humai withal
<lb/>Spake of the swift remove of Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And of his hasty flight without a host,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1544"/>
<lb/>Before the noble Khan whose heart and soul
<lb/>Expanded like a rose. He told the Turkmans: <q>"Now we have saddled the revolving sky!
<lb/>Who ever took Iran without a fight
<lb/>As we have by our counsel, wit, and patience?"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave great presents to the messenger,
<lb/>Drachms and no few dinars, and wrote this answer: <q>"May wisdom company the pure of soul.
<lb/>I do agree to what hath been proposed
<lb/>By this ambassador of honest men.
<lb/>When with my host I reach Marv I will make
<lb/>The clime like pheasant's plumes,"</q><note>Because <foreign>tadarv</foreign>, <gloss>pheasant</gloss>, rhymes with <foreign>Marv</foreign>."</note> <q>"and streams run
<lb/>milk"</q><note>Reading with P. and T.</note><q>"By justice, prudence, and magnificence.
<lb/>I will await the tribute from Iran—
<lb/>The Lions' gifts and taxes. I shall come
<lb/>To Marv, or rather I shall pass it by,
<lb/>Not wishing to cause damage by my troops."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The messenger returned in haste and told
<lb/>His converse with the Khan who led his host
<lb/>To Marv, the world was black with horsemen's dust.
<lb/>When he had rested he concerned himself
<lb/>With feasting; no one thought about Bahram.
<lb/>At Marv there was no rest or sleep for sound
<lb/>Of harp and lyre, the troops were all abroad.
<lb/>There was no watch, no prospect of a shock,
<lb/>But all was sport, wine, parties, twang of lyre,
<lb/>And feeling night and day secure from war.
<pb n="89"/>
<lb/>The Khan was looking for the Iranians' tribute.
<lb/>Wroth that it came so late. Bahram for his part
<lb/>Slept not but guarded well his host from foes,
<lb/>Kept his spies busy both by night and day,
<lb/>And threw in feast and wine no time away.
</p>


<head>§ 20 How Bahram attacked the Host of the Khan and took him</head>

<p>
<lb/>As soon as tidings came to Shah Bahram:
<lb/><q>"The Khan and his great host are all at Marv,"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He led his soldiers from Azargashasp,
<lb/>Each with two horses but no baggage-train.
<lb/>With Ruman helmet, morion, and cuirass
<lb/>He hurried on like wind by day and night,
<lb/>His soldiers rushing like a mountain-stream,
<lb/>And reached Amul by way of Ardabil.
<lb/>Departing thence he marched on to Gurgan,
<lb/>Enduring all the chieftains’ toil and pain,
<lb/>And thence came to the city of Nisa;
<lb/>One from Bisa preceded him as guide.
<lb/>O’er mount and waterless and wayless tracts,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1545"/>
<lb/>At times unwonted, through the night till morn,
<lb/>He marched and had the watch out night and day.
<lb/>Thus swifter than a pheasant<note>See p. 88, note.</note> in its flight
<lb/>He drew toward Marv. A runner from his scouts
<lb/>Arrived and told: <q>"The Khan attendeth not
<lb/>To state-affairs but followeth the chase
<lb/>At Kashmihan with wicked Ahriman
<lb/>As minister."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram rejoiced to hear it;
<lb/>His travail seemed but wind. There for a day
<lb/>He rested and, when steed and Shah and troops

<pb n="90"/>

<lb/>Were all refreshed, reached Kashmihan. At dawn,
<lb/>What time the Lustre of the world arose
<lb/>Above the hills, all ears were filled with blast
<lb/>Of trumpet and all eyes with glint of flag-tops,
<lb/>The din of battle went up from the chase,
<lb/>And filled the ears of Shah and troops. The clamour
<lb/>Split mighty lions’ ears. Thou wouldst have said:
<lb/><q>'The clouds are hailing," wouldst have said: "The moon
<lb/>Is raining blood,"</q> so sanguine was the dust
<lb/>Upon that battlefield! The Khan, aroused
<lb/>And dazed, was ta’en by Khazarwén. Withal
<lb/>Three hundred of the noblemen of Chin
<lb/>Were captured and fast bound on saddle-back.
<lb/>The Shah advanced on Marv from Kashmihan,
<lb/>Thin as a reed with riding for so long.
<lb/>The few of Chin that yet remained at Marv
<lb/>They slew. He followed up the fugitives
<lb/>For thirty leagues; behind him was Karan
<lb/>Of Pars. Returning to the hunting-ground
<lb/>He gave the booty to the troops. When thus
<lb/>He raised his head in triumph over Chin
<lb/>He recognised in all the power of God,
<lb/>Who to his other good had given the boon
<lb/>Of might, and is the Lord of sun and moon.
</p>

<head>§ 21 How Bahram took a Pledge from the Turanians, how he set up
a Pillar to delimit the Realm, and placed Shahra upon the
Throne of Turan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur stayed to rest at Marv and when
<lb/>Both Shah and war-steed were refreshed he chose
<lb/>Bukhara for the next attack, for he
<pb n="91"/>
<lb/>Had changed from gentleness to bitterness.
<lb/>He reached Amwi<note>Probably the modern Charjui.</note> in one day and one night,
<lb/>Intent on conquest not on chase and sport.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1546"/>
<lb/>He reached it in the night’s first watch and crossed
<lb/>The river<note>The Oxus.</note> and the desert of Farab.
<lb/>Whenas the air was golden with the sun,
<lb/>And doffed its skirt of lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>The world was like a falcon’s wing with dust
<lb/>What time the world-lord passed by Mai and Margh.
<lb/>He smote the Turkman host and set on fire
<lb/>Their fields and fells, the stars concealed themselves
<lb/>Behind the moon’s skirts while the fathers made
<lb/>Their way across the bodies of their sons.
<lb/>All of the Turkmans that were leading men,
<lb/>Both veteran and youthful swordsmen, came
<lb/>Afoot in evil case before Bahram,
<lb/>With full hearts abjectly, and said: <q>"O Shah!
<lb/>O mighty one! O favourite of the stars!
<lb/>O chief of all the nobles of the world!
<lb/>Since now the Khan is captive that broke faith
<lb/>Shed not the blood of those that did no wrong,
<lb/>For tyranny becometh not the great.
<lb/>If thou demandest tribute it is well,
<lb/>But why behead the guiltless? All of us,
<lb/>Both men and women, are thy slaves and are
<lb/>Thy vanquished in the fight."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah’s heart burned
<lb/>For them. He sewed up with the hand of wisdom
<lb/>The eye of his displeasure. In concern
<lb/>That man of God restrained his warriors’ hands
<lb/>From shedding blood. His favour thus secured,
<lb/>The man of wrath appeased, the leading chiefs
<lb/>Agreed to pay a heavy tribute yearly.
<lb/>The Shah was well content; he took the tribute,
<lb/>And further sums in lieu of pillaging.

<pb n="92"/>
<lb/>He turned and reached the city of Farab,
<lb/>His cheeks were flushed and smiles were on his lips.
<lb/>He paused, allowed his troops to rest a week,
<lb/>And called to him the potentates of Chin.
<lb/>He reared a column of cement and stone,
<lb/>Which none, save by the Shah’s command, might pass
<lb/>Out of Iran, Khalaj, and Turkistan.
<lb/>He made the line between them the Jihun.
<lb/>There was among the troops one Shahra hight,
<lb/>A man of wisdom, rank, success, and fame.
<lb/>Bahram made him the ruler of Turan,
<lb/>And made his throne the crown upon the moon.
<lb/>When Shahra sat upon the silver throne
<lb/>He girt his loins and opened wide his hands,
<lb/>Set too the golden crown upon his head,
<lb/>And through the land joy universal spread.
</p>

<head>§ 22 How Bahram wrote to announce his Victory to his Brother Narsi and returned to Iran</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1547"/>
<lb/>The business of Turan achieved, and when
<lb/>The Shah’s heart was released from care, he bade
<lb/>A scribe attend him, called for pen and ink
<lb/>And silk of Chin, and wrote Narsi a letter
<lb/>About the Turkman war and what his troops
<lb/>Had done. It thus began: <q>The nobles praise
<lb/>Through me—a slave—the Maker of the world—
<lb/>The Lord of victory and mastery,
<lb/>The Lord of Saturn, Mars, and Moon, the Lord
<lb/>Of lofty, circling heaven, the Lord of mean
<lb/>And miserable dust. The great and lowly
<lb/>Are underneath His governance, and all
<lb/>That is to be is subject to His word.
<pb n="93"/>
<lb/>I have indited from the coasts of Chin
<lb/>A letter to my brother in Iran,
<lb/>And this same letter, writ on painted silk,
<lb/>Is meant too for our chiefs and folk at large.
<lb/>Those that were not engaged against the Khan
<lb/>Must hear the tale from us who fought with him.
<lb/>His army was so vast that thou hadst said:
<lb/><q>'The dust thereof hath smeared the sky with pitch!'</q>
<lb/>The coasts became as ’twere a sea of blood,
<lb/>The unjust’s fortune drooped, and he was taken
<lb/>Because<note>Reading with P.</note> the turning sky was weary of him.
<lb/>Now have I brought him on a camel bound,
<lb/>With wounded liver and with blood-filled eyes.
<lb/>The necks of all the proud are bent, their tongues
<lb/>Are gentle, and their hearts are hot within them.
<lb/>Those now pay tribute who were enemies,
<lb/>And they that erred have come back to the way.
<lb/>I and my host, as my well-wishers would,
<lb/>Will follow this dispatch.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The wind-foot camels,
<lb/>Foam-scattering, parted like a thunder-clap,
<lb/>And when the letter reached Narsi the heart
<lb/>Of that prince throbbed with joy. The high priest came
<lb/>With all the heroes of the royal race
<lb/>Before Narsi, the palace rang with joy,
<lb/>And all gave ear to that report. The nobles
<lb/>Were pricked at heart for shame before the Shah
<lb/>By reason of their fault. Among the chiefs
<lb/>Six score and ten and more went to Narsi
<lb/>To proffer their excuses, saying thus:
<lb/><q>'Perverse suggestions and the Div’s behest
<lb/>Have led us to transgress the World-lord’s way.
<lb/>To such a host as that one would presume
<lb/>That God would ope Heaven’s gate. ’Tis marvellous,
<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1548"/>
<lb/>Surpassing thought and all the providence
<lb/>Of wise and learnéd men! In thy reply,
<lb/>’"Mongst matters fair and foul, vouchsafe to give
<lb/>A place to our excuse. Although the chiefs
<lb/>Have erred the illustrious Shah may pardon them.'</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Narsi agreed and said: <q>'So will I do
<lb/>As to release the Shah’s heart from revenge.'</q>
<lb/>He wrote at once an answer to the letter,
<lb/>Disclosing matters fair and foul, and said:
<lb/><q>'The Iranians in their pain and misery,
<lb/>And for the sake of country, children, treasure,
<lb/>Went for protection to the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Despairing of their own illustrious Shah;
<lb/>'Twas not through enmity, offence, or strife;
<lb/>No other Shah had gained their preference.
<lb/>Now if the conqueror, the king of kings,
<lb/>Will pardon he will make their dark night day.
<lb/>Me they selected as the advocate
<lb/>To urge their cause, and bade me: ‘Plead for us.’</q>
<lb/>An archimage, by name Burzmihr, agreed
<lb/>To go upon that embassage, approached
<lb/>The monarch of the world, and told him all.
<lb/>The Shah was well contented by the words,
<lb/>The fire of his fierce anger ceased to fume.
<lb/>Then from Chaghan, Khatlan, Balkh, and Bukhara
<lb/>The chieftains went with tribute, and the archmages
<lb/>From the Gharchis with sacred twigs, and pleaded
<lb/>Before the worshippers of Fire, and thus
<lb/>From year to year all those that had the means
<lb/>Went to the court with taxes and with tribute.
<lb/>When the Fire-fane was ready and the place
<lb/>To hold the feasts of New Year and of Sada
<lb/>The Shah approached Azar Abadagan,
<lb/>He and his nobles and his men of name;
<lb/>They went to make their prayers before the Fire,
<lb/>And all the archmages offered reverence.

<lb/>The Shah gave largess to the worshippers,
<lb/>And passing thence proceeded to Istakhr,
<lb/>Which was the glory of the king of kings.
<lb/>From ox-hides and from sheep-skins, borne before him
<lb/>Upon the backs of elephants, were scattered
<lb/>A thousand quintals and eight score of largess;
<lb/>Part was in drachms, the rest in gold dinars—
<lb/>Coin that an archimage of Pars would call
<lb/>In ancient Persian “paidawasis.”<note>The <foreign>paidawasi</foreign> was a silver coin=to five dinars.</note> Then
<lb/>He brought his scented leather bags of coin,
<lb/>And lavished gold and silver. If he saw
<lb/>Upon a journey any broken bridge,
<lb/>Or heard of any hostelry in ruins
<lb/>From his officials, he would give command
<lb/>For their repair out of his treasury
<lb/>Without forced labour. On the poor withal,
<lb/>And those that toiled to earn their daily bread,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1549"/>
<lb/>He lavished drachms, for bounty never irked him,
<lb/>While, thirdly, on the honest folk, the widows,
<lb/>And infant orphans, he showered silver.
<lb/>Fourthly, on those too old for work or warfare,
<lb/>And, fifthly, on all those of noble birth
<lb/>That were despised by wealthy folk, and sixthly
<lb/>On folk that coming from a lengthy journey
<lb/>Paraded not their poverty, he lavished
<lb/>A treasure, and looked round him to do good.
<lb/>All booty he made over to his troops,
<lb/>And had no notion of amassing wealth.
<lb/>He bade a pious archimage to bring him
<lb/>The crown worn by the Khan of Chin. They took
<lb/>The jewels out and used them and the gold
<lb/>To grace a Fire-fane’s walls and decorate
<lb/>The throne-top of Azar. Thence he departed
<lb/>To Taisafan where dwelt Narsi with those
<lb/>Archmages that advised him. All the chiefs,
<pb n="95"/>
<lb/>The great men of Iran, and governors,
<lb/>Came forth to meet the Shah, and when Narsi
<lb/>Beheld that royal head and crown, the flags
<lb/>Resplendent, and that mighty host, he lighted,
<lb/>With all the great men and august archmages,
<lb/>And did obeisance to Bahram who bade him
<lb/>To mount again, and grasped him by the hand,
<lb/>Then went up to the golden throne and sat
<lb/>What while the chiefs stood girded in his presence.
<lb/>He lavished treasure on the indigent,
<lb/>They opened wide the prison’s narrow doors,
<lb/>The age was filled with jollity and justice,
<lb/>The hearts of all were strangers to distress.
<lb/>He banished toil and grief from every clime,
<lb/>He made a banquet for the great, and all
<lb/>That hasted to attend the royal board
<lb/>Received a present worthy of a lord.
</p>

<head>§ 23 How Bahram wrote a Letter of Directions to his Officials</head>
<p>
<lb/>The third day at a feast made for the nobles
<lb/>A scribe was brought and set before the Shah,
<lb/>Who, when his visage was relaxed with wine,
<lb/>Wrote, joying in his lovingkindliness,
<lb/>A letter which began with praise of one
<lb/>That hath with knowledge laved his soul, made wisdom
<lb/>The jewel of his heart, won opulence
<lb/>By his own toil and hardihood, acknowledged
<lb/>That all good is from God, hath sought for wisdom,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1550"/>
<lb/>Made friends of sages, knoweth that from justice
<lb/>Naught will proceed but good, and knocketh not
<lb/>Upon the portal of malignity:—
<pb n="97"/>
<lb/><q>If one complaineth of mine officers,
<lb/>My noble chieftains or my men of war,
<lb/>They have no prospect but the cell or gibbet,
<lb/>And, if slain, vile committal to the dust.
<lb/>Endeavour to make others’ travail small,
<lb/>Give joy and happiness to mourners’ hearts,
<lb/>Because the world hath stayed, will stay, with none;
<lb/>Be just and inoffensive, that sufficeth.
<lb/>I am exemplary of what I say,
<lb/>And an incentive to all righteousness,
<lb/>For what a multitude of troops assailed
<lb/>Me and this noble company, while I
<lb/>Departed with a little host, and those
<lb/>Who were mine enemies are now my friends!
<lb/>One noble personage—the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>A world-lord having signet, crown, and throne—
<lb/>I captured, and the Turkmans’ fortunes fell.
<lb/>All-holy God made me victorious,
<lb/>My foemen’s heads have come to dust. Be service
<lb/>My sole employ, mine every thought be right.
<lb/>I will impose no tax for seven years
<lb/>On subject or compeer. I write this letter
<lb/>In our old tongue to chiefs and to officials
<lb/>That they may treat my subjects in accord
<lb/>To righteous precedent and take no thought
<lb/>Of doing wrong. Dispatch to me the names
<lb/>Of those that are in want within your towns,
<lb/>And in their portion have no day of joy,
<lb/>And well will I content them. Furthermore,
<lb/>If there be any men of noble birth,
<lb/>Who can recall to memory better days,
<lb/>Them also with my treasures set past need,
<lb/>And magnify the wise. The folk in debt,
<lb/>And empty-handed, who are everywhere
<lb/>Looked down upon and scorned, them too relieve
<lb/>Of debt and write their names upon the roll.
<pb n="98"/>
<lb/>Pray ye to God to keep our heart thus true
<lb/>To custom and the Faith, joy in this precept,
<lb/>And well entreat the underlings. Moreover,
<lb/>Despise not your own slaves, for they, like you,
<lb/>Are God’s. Let one of wealth, and fit therefor,
<lb/>Entrust to learnéd men his children. Make
<lb/>Their spirits rich in knowledge and encrown
<lb/>Their heads with wisdom. Keep your hands afar
<lb/>From others’ wealth, be ye without offence,
<lb/>And worshippers of God. Be diligent,
<lb/>Break not our fealty, and eradicate
<lb/>The stumps, the suckers, and the roots of evil.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1551"/>
<lb/>Seek not to do your neighbours injury,
<lb/>Especially the magnates and the rich;
<lb/>Make God your refuge, keep His ordinance,
<lb/>And your souls pledges of your love for Him.
<lb/>Whoever hath grown great from nothingness,
<lb/>And raised himself to independency,
<lb/>Call him not great, such greatness dwindleth soon.
<lb/>Be just, be worshippers of God, and wash
<lb/>Perverseness and injustice from your hands.
<lb/>All ye that have! withhold not from the poor;
<lb/>Incline to holiness and act aright;
<lb/>Break not the hearts and backs of suppliants;
<lb/>Mishap is nigh to all things done amiss.
<lb/>God’s favour be upon the soul of him
<lb/>To whom humanity is warp and woof.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When they had written thus on lustrous silk
<lb/>The scribe dipped into musk his pen and wrote
<lb/>The heading thus: <q>The monarch of the world,
<lb/>The heart of justice, knowing good and ill,
<lb/>The lord of pardon, Grace, and puissance,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, the all-bounteous king of kings,
<lb/>To his marchlords and those beneath his rule—
<lb/>The wise and understanding, warlike chiefs.</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="99"/>
<lb/>Then runners, cavaliers, and cameleers
<lb/>Went with the letter everywhere with guides,
<lb/>And when it came to all the provinces,
<lb/>To every nobleman and chief, all said :-
<lb/><q>Thanks be to God, the world-lord is devout.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thereat the women, men, and children went
<lb/>In all lands from their houses to the plain,
<lb/>And all invoked a blessing silently
<lb/>Upon that upright monarch of the world,
<lb/>Then set themselves to feast and called for wine,
<lb/>And harp and minstrelsy. They feasted half
<lb/>The day, the other half they toiled.
<lb/>At springtide
<lb/>It was proclaimed before the court at dawn :
<lb/><q>Let those of substance eat and give away.
<lb/>Let them thank us for that which they enjoy,
<lb/>And let the poor come to the treasury,
<lb/>And carry thence five drachms of proper weight,
<lb/>Together with three mans<note>Cf. Vol. i. p. 290 note.</note> of bright, old wine
<lb/>Hued like pomegranate-blossom or like gold.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The world disposed itself to merriment,
<lb/>The shouts of revellers filled town and hamlet
<lb/>Until they bought a coronal of roses
<lb/>For two dinars and gave without complaint
<lb/>A drachm for a narcissus-spike. The old
<lb/>Grew young of heart with joy, the streams ran milk.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1552"/>
<lb/>The Shah thanked God on seeing all the world
<lb/>Thus glad.
<lb/>One day he thus addressed Narsi :
<lb/><q>Depart hence with the signet and the crown.
<lb/>I have bestowed upon thee Khurasan;
<lb/>Cause it to flourish; joy our subjects’ hearts;
<lb/>Be nothing if not just; stint not thy hand
<lb/>Within this Place of Passage.<note><cit><quote>n’interromps jamais le passage a travers ce pays.</quote> <bibl>Mohl</bibl></cit></note> If our father
<pb n="100"/>
<lb/>Sought ill he quaked therefor like naked men
<lb/>Beneath an autumn-blast.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He bade prepare
<lb/>A robe of honour for Narsi, thus voiding
<lb/>An opulent treasury, and said to him :
<lb/><q>God shelter thee, and be the sun’s throne thine.</q>
<lb/>The journey took two se’nnights, then Narsi
<lb/>Assumed in peace the rule of Khurasan.
<lb/>When he had gone one week the Shah, whose heart
<lb/>Was freed from care, bade, and the high priest went
<lb/>Before him, bringing certain of the nobles.
<lb/>The Shah addressed him, saying: <q>Ceasar’s business
<lb/>Is dragging on, and his ambassador
<lb/>Is waiting long for his dismission.
<lb/>What sort of man is he, and from the standpoint
<lb/>Of wisdom where is he, for wisdom straighteneth
<lb/>The soul?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The high priest answered: <q>Blest be thou,
<lb/>Lord of the world, and dowered with Grace divine.
<lb/>He is advanced in years, discreet, and modest,
<lb/>A man of goodly speech and gentle voice,
<lb/>A pupil of the school of Falatun,<note>Plato.</note>
<lb/>A man of wisdom, learned, and nobly born.
<lb/>He left Rum, full of energy, but now,
<lb/>Since he hath been here, he hath grown depressed,
<lb/>And torpid like a snake in winter-time,<note>Literally, "in the month of Dai."</note>
<lb/>With weak frame and with cheeks of reed-like hue.
<lb/>His servitors are all like sheep before
<lb/>A hunting cheetah, but regard not us;
<lb/>Such are their manhood and their valiancy
<lb/>They think none in this land a man at all.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur answered thus the high priest: <q>God
<lb/>Bestoweth Grace and diadem and might.
<lb/>If He hath given me victory, and turned
<lb/>My fortune’s night to day, still Caesar too

<pb n="101"/>
<lb/>Is of imperial race, is great, is sprung
<lb/>From Salm whose head was crowned by Faridan,
<lb/>And can recount his lineage sire by sire.
<lb/>He acteth in a manly, prudent way,
<lb/>And hath not turned to madness like the Khan.
<lb/>At audience we will call the envoy in,
<lb/>To see if what he saith be to the point,
<lb/>And then I will dismiss him graciously,
<lb/>For men are useful to me in this world;
<lb/>One is for war and bringeth troops, another
<lb/>For feasting and doth bring a golden crown.
<lb/>I must maintain the honour of Iran,
<lb/>The man that treateth with great men is great.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The high priest praised him lovingly and said:-
<lb/><q>Live happily so long as heaven revolveth.
<lb/>He shall not speak save to exalt thy fame:
<lb/>Mayst thou be chief among the men of name.</q>
</p>

<head>§ 24
How Bahram called before him the Envoy of Caesar, and how
the Envoy questioned and answered the Archmages</head>
<p>
<lb/>The next day when the sun displayed its crown,
<lb/>And rays proceeded from the vaulted sky,
<lb/>The monarch of the world sat on his throne,
<lb/>And called the envoy in before his lords.
<lb/>That old man sage, experienced, eloquent,
<lb/>Of understanding and retentive mind,
<lb/>Approaching with dejected head and arms
<lb/>Enfolded, kneeled before the monarch’s throne.
<lb/>Bahram both greeted and made much of him,
<lb/>Set him upon the turquoise throne and said :—
<lb/>“Here thou hast sojourned long; art thou not weary
<lb/>Of looking on this land? War with the Khan,
<pb n="102"/>
<lb/>Which closely partnered me, withheld me from thee;
<lb/>Now all our case is altered, and thy sojourn
<lb/>Exceedeth bounds. To that which thou shalt say
<lb/>We will reply, deriving from thy words
<lb/>Good rede.”’
<lb/>The ancient envoy praised him, saying :—
<lb/>"May time and earth ne’er lose thee. Every king
<lb/>Possessed of wisdom joyeth in the words
<lb/>Of sages; sages are more nigh to God;
<lb/>Those that think evil have the darker day.
<lb/>Midst this world’s chieftains thou art chief, who art
<lb/>At once Shah, chief, and best. Thy tongue’s a balance,
<lb/>Thy words are jewels, and who e’er will see
<lb/>Gems weighed ’gainst gold? Thou art possessed of knowledge,
<lb/>Of counsel, sense, and Grace, and all the methods
<lb/>Of conquering kings; thou art possessed of wisdom
<lb/>And holy rede, and master of the wise.
<lb/>Though Caesar’s envoy I am thy slave’s slave.
<lb/>I carry Caesar’s greeting to the Shah :—
<lb/>‘May this head, throne, and crown forever be.’
<lb/>And furthermore I have it in command
<lb/>To ask seven questions of thy men of lore.”</p>

<p>The Shah replied : ‘Proceed; the highest honours
<lb/>Await the eloquent.” 
<lb/>He bade the high priest
<lb/>Come to his presence with the famous sages,
<lb/>But sighs were on his lips the while in view
<lb/>Of what the man might ask. ‘“What are,” he thought, —
<milestone unit="calced" n="1554"/>
<lb/>“The seven mysterious things whereof this Roman
<lb/>Would question us?”’
<lb/>The high priest with the learned,
<lb/>Men mighty in all lore, came, and the spokesman
<lb/>Revealed the secret, telling to the high priest
<lb/>The words of Caesar: “‘What is ‘the within’
<lb/>In thy nomenclature, what ‘the without,’
<pb n="103"/>
<lb/>O guide, who hast no other name therefor?
<lb/>What is ‘the above,’ my lord, what ‘the beneath’?
<lb/>What is ‘the infinite’ and what ‘the vile’?
<lb/>What hath most names and ruleth everywhere?”’
<lb/>‘Haste not,” the high priest answered thus the sage,
<lb/>‘And turn not from the path of understanding.”</p>

<p>He then proceeded : ‘O thou man of wisdom!
<lb/>Give ear to each reply that I shall make:
<lb/>There is one answer only to thy words.
<lb/>As to thy question touching ‘the without,’
<lb/>And ‘the within,’ it is an easy one:
<lb/>The heaven is ‘the without,’ air ‘the within’;
<lb/>They are the Glory of the Omnipotent;
<lb/>God, touching this world, is ‘the infinite,’
<lb/>For lore to turn thee from Him is ‘the vile’;
<lb/>‘The above’ is Paradise, Hell ‘the beneath,’
<lb/>And he is wicked that doth fear not God.
<lb/>Next as to that with many names whose will
<lb/>Prevaileth everywhere: O ancient! wisdom
<lb/>Hath many names, and wisdom compasseth
<lb/>The will of kings. One man may call it love,
<lb/>Another faith, but in its absence all
<lb/>Is pain and tyranny. The eloquent
<lb/>Term it uprightness and the fortunate
<lb/>Astuteness; ‘tis at whiles long-suffering,
<lb/>At whiles trustworthiness, for speech therewith
<lb/>Is safe. So divers are the names of wisdom
<lb/>That they exceed account. Allow that naught
<lb/>Surpasseth it; it is the chief of goods,
<lb/>And knoweth this world’s hoarded mysteries,
<lb/>Which mortal vision cannot penetrate.
<lb/>Again, the stars that glitter in the sky
<lb/>Are what the master can afford to slight
<lb/>For understanding of the Maker’s work.
<lb/>The eye that gazeth cannot reckon them,
<lb/>And heaven above is unattainable
<pb n="104"/>
<lb/>As being measureless, so thou mayst scorn
<lb/>Such reckonings and processes of Fate.
<lb/>One that can follow not an arrow’s course,
<lb/>Shrewd though he be, will marvel still thereat;
<lb/>Then what can be more futile, favoured sir!
<lb/>Than to compute heaven’s stars? This much I know,
<lb/>And if another replication be
<lb/>'Tis that the Maker’s mysteries are vast.”’
<milestone unit="calced" n="1555"/>
<lb/>When Caesar’s spokesman heard he kissed the ground,
<lb/>And offered praise. ‘‘World-ruling Shah,” he said,
<lb/>‘“Ask nothing more of God, for all the world
<lb/>Is thine to bid, the heads of all the great
<lb/>Are under thy control, the world hath not
<lb/>A king like thee in mind, thou praised by all
<lb/>The high-born nobles! while thy minister
<lb/>In knowledge passeth sage and archimage.
<lb/>All the philosophers are slaves to him,
<lb/>And at his wisdom hang their heads.”’
<lb/>Bahram,
<lb/>On hearing, showed his pleasure, his heart brightened.
<lb/>He bade a robe of honour be made ready
<lb/>Of things most valued in his treasury,
<lb/>And gave the archimage withal ten purses
<lb/>Of drachms with raiment, steed, and much besides,
<lb/>And then the envoy of illustrious Caesar
<lb/>Went from the royal presence to his lodging.
<lb/>When Sol displayed its hand upon the sky
<lb/>The king of kings sat on his golden throne,
<lb/>And Caesar’s envoy came to court, and with him
<lb/>The high priest wise and worshipful. They went
<lb/>With joy before the king of kings, conversing
<lb/>On many matters, and the Shah’s high priest
<lb/>Said to the envoy: “Matchless, peerless sage!
<lb/>What thing is so injurious that we
<lb/>Must weep at its occurrence? What know’st thou
<pb n="105"/>
<lb/>So useful to the world that men become
<lb/>Exalted when it chanceth?”</p>

<p>Said the envoy :—
<lb/>The wise aye will be great and powerful.
<lb/>The person of the foolish is more vile
<lb/>Than clay and undeserving of all good.
<lb/>Thou spakest of the unwise and of the wise,
<lb/>And hast received, maybe, the right response.”</p>

<p>The high priest said to him: “Consider well,
<lb/>Reflect, and put not fish upon the dry.”</p>

<p>The envoy said : “O man approved by all!
<lb/>One well may quote the sayings of the wise,
<lb/>But, if thou knowest another answer, speak,
<lb/>For knowledge giveth increment to fame.”’
<lb/>The high priest answered: “Think, for speech resulteth
<lb/>From thought and brain, and know thou that the death
<lb/>Of one least harmful is the greatest loss
<lb/>Of all, but thou mayst joy when bad men die,
<lb/>Albeit death is common to us all.
<lb/>This then is profit and the other loss:
<lb/>Let wisdom judge the answer of us both.”</p>

<p>The Roman gave assent to what he heard;
<lb/>Those words seemed excellent to him; he smiled,
<lb/>Did reverence to the Shah and said to him :—
<lb/>‘How happy is the country of Iran!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1556"/>
<lb/>For others look not on a king of kings
<lb/>Like thee, or on a high priest such as thine.
<lb/>Thou art the world’s high crown in understanding,
<lb/>In priests thou art the greatest of the great.
<lb/>Wouldst thou from Caesar tribute? Be it so,
<lb/>Because thy minister is sovereign
<lb/>In wisdom,” and his words rejoiced the king,
<lb/>Whose heart grew fresh as roses in the spring.</p>

<pb n="106"/>
<head>§ 25
How Bahram dismissed Caesar’s Envoy and charged his own Officials</head>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy left the presence of the Shah,
<lb/>The night came on, the Sable Banner rose,
<lb/>The men of lore were weary of discourse,
<lb/>The valiant monarch sought his ladies’ bower.
<lb/>The circling vault of heaven rested not,
<lb/>But roused the sleepers from their drowsihead,
<lb/>The fountain of the sun set up its flag,
<lb/>The world-Shah’s head woke lightly from repose,
<lb/>The chamberlain unlocked the audience-door,
<lb/>The king sat down upon the throne of gold.
<lb/>He bade a robe of honour be made ready,
<lb/>The envoy summoned. Indian scimitars
<lb/>With golden scabbards, noble steeds betrapped
<lb/>With gold, dinars, gems, musk, and spicery,
<lb/>Beyond that ancient man’s imaginings,
<lb/>The shrewd Shah gave the envoy, then was busied
<lb/>With his own folk’s affairs. By his command
<lb/>The high priest, who was counsellor withal,
<lb/>Approached him with a noble company,
<lb/>And he apportioned all the land among
<lb/>Those warlike paladins, gave drachms and steeds
<lb/>And signet-rings and casques, and, to the greatest,
<lb/>Thrones, crowns, and provinces. He filled the world
<lb/>With right, and small and great rejoiced in him.
<lb/>He banned the unjust with chilling words, unlargessed,
<lb/>And, after, thus harangued the archimages:—
<lb/>"Ye sages worshipful and pure of heart!
<lb/>The world for us hath many memories
<lb/>Of doings of the Shahs unjust and just,
<lb/>Whose hands oft-times were stretched for ill what while
<lb/>Their persons lurked mid ease and luxury.
<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<pb n="107"/>
<lb/>The world was frighted by these evil men,
<lb/>The hearts of all the good were rent in twain;
<lb/>All hands were occupied with evil-doing,
<lb/>And none was instant in the cause of God;
<lb/>The Div’s work everywhere prevailed; hearts ceased
<lb/>To fear the Master of the world. The head
<lb/>Of virtues and the hand of ill, the door
<lb/>Of understanding and the quest of wisdom,
<lb/>Are laid upon the Shah’s neck, and in him
<lb/>Especially are seen both right and wrong.
<lb/>My sire, who stretched his hand out to injustice,
<lb/>Was not a holy man, wise or devout.
<lb/>Hold not his actions strange, for rust attacked
<lb/>The bright steel of his heart. Consider too
<lb/>The experience of Jamshid and Shah Kaus
<lb/>For having sought the guidance of the Div.
<lb/>My father in like manner followed them,
<lb/>And washed not his dark soul in wisdom’s stream.
<lb/>His subjects writhed, and many lost their lives
<lb/>Through his severity. Now he hath gone,
<lb/>Hath left behind him but an evil name,
<lb/>And hath no praise from any, yet let us
<lb/>Give blessings to his soul, for God forbid
<lb/>That it should writhe through our vindictiveness;
<lb/>And now that I am seated on his throne
<lb/>His way will doubtless be to Paradise.
<lb/>I ask the world’s Lord to bestow upon me,
<lb/>Alike in public and in private, strength
<lb/>To treat my subjects with humanity,
<lb/>And make pure musk out of the darksome dust,
<lb/>That when therewith my body shall conjoin
<lb/>None wronged by me may pluck me by the skirt.
<lb/>Put ye too on the robe of uprightness,
<lb/>With hearts washed clean from wrong, for none is born
<lb/>Unless to die, be he of Persian, Arab,
<lb/>Or Roman race; death’s charge is lion-like,
<pb n="108"/>
<lb/>And from its claws none can withdraw the neck;
<lb/>It maketh quarry of the rending lion,
<lb/>The dragon’s body ’scapeth not its toils.
<lb/>Where are the heads and crowns of kings of kings!
<lb/>Where are the mighty and the glorious chiefs?
<lb/>Where are the cavaliers and haughty ones?
<lb/>I see no trace of them within the world.
<lb/>Where are its fair who joyed those chieftains’ souls?
<lb/>Know thou that all whose cheeks are ‘neath the shroud
<lb/>Are wedded to the dust. Let all of us
<lb/>Have hands both clean and good, and not commit
<lb/>The world to evil ways. I swear by God,
<lb/>The Lord of all, who gave to me the Grace,
<lb/>With crown and throne, high birth and quality,
<lb/>That if an officer of mine shall wrong
<lb/>The mean or mighty by a pinch of dust
<lb/>I will consume his body in the fire,
<lb/>Or hang him to a gibbet by the neck.
<lb/>If in the watches of the night a thief
<lb/>Shall steal a poor man’s quilt I will make good
<lb/>His loss from mine own treasury with brocade,
<lb/>And wash the hearts of mourners from their woe;
<lb/>While if a sheep be taken from the flock
<lb/>In dark night or in snow-storm I will give
<lb/>Instead thereof a steed of noble race,
<lb/>And God forbid that I should ask for thanks.
<lb/>If in a war against mine enemies
<lb/>A cavalier is wounded in the fight
<lb/>I will assign him yearly maintenance,
<lb/>I will not leave his children in distress.
<lb/>Praise ye the Judge that knoweth what is good
<lb/>Throughout eternity. Let none lay hand
<lb/>On water or on fire except the priests
<lb/>That are fire-worshippers. Slay not draught-oxen,
<lb/>For they are of avail in husbandry,
<lb/>Unless past work and worthless to their owner.
<pb n="109"/>
<lb/>Pack-oxen too must not be slain, the land
<lb/>Else will grow void of grace. Deliberate
<lb/>In all things with the men of lore and break not
<lb/>The hearts of children that are fatherless.
<lb/>Be alien from the promptings of the Div,
<lb/>In fight ensue not feast. If I require
<lb/>My subjects to pay taxes I abjure
<lb/>God, throne, and crown. Since Yazdagird, my father,
<lb/>Did evil, to redress that wrong have I
<lb/>Disseminated justice. Let your hearts
<lb/>All joy to do it and in gratitude
<lb/>Observe the Cult of Fire. God may forgive him,
<lb/>And guide him out of Hell to Paradise.
<lb/>Give pleasure to the young, break not the hearts
<lb/>Of lieges, keep from drunkenness in age,
<lb/>For ’tis unseemly in the old to tope;
<lb/>Sin ye not therefore, for in age ’tis well
<lb/>To make your preparations to depart.
<lb/>If God, the righteous Judge, approveth us
<lb/>Let not the future trouble you to-day;
<lb/>Let there be pleasure in my subjects’ hearts,
<lb/>And let the nobles’ heads be free from grief.”
<lb/>The chiefs, on hearing and considering well
<lb/>His words, all wept that such an one was theirs,
<lb/>A Shah so wise and shrewd, acclaimed his worth,
<lb/>And hailed him as the great king of the earth.</p>


<head>§ 26
How Bahram went with his own Letter to Shangul, King of Hind</head>
<p>
<lb/>A wise wazir rose to his feet and said:—
<lb/>"O judge of what is just and right! the world
<lb/>Hath ceased to fear malignants, toil and stress
<lb/>Have left our coasts. Howbeit famed Shangul
<pb n="110"/>
<lb/>Among the folk of Hind is still perverse;
<lb/>His bands of plunderers infest the earth
<lb/>From Hindustan up to the coasts of Chin.
<lb/>He will lay hands for ill upon Iran,
<lb/>And thou shouldst apprehend this. Thou art Shah;
<lb/>Shangul but wardeth Hind, so why should he
<lb/>Take toll of Sind and Chin? Consider this,
<lb/>And note his plans, for ill must not ensue."
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing this, was full of thought,
<lb/>The world before him seemed a tangled brake,
<lb/>And thus he answered: "I will deal herewith
<lb/>In secret, not consulting any one.
<lb/>I will myself alone observe his troops,
<lb/>The conduct of his kingship and his throne,
<lb/>Approaching him as an ambassador,
<lb/>And not acquaint the Iranians and the lords.
<lb/>O holy archimage! write to Shangul
<lb/>A firm but courteous letter."
</p>

<p>Thereupon
<lb/>His pious minister went with a scribe,
<lb/>And others that were indispensable,
<lb/>And canvassed all the case, brought paper, ink,
<lb/>And pen, and wrote a letter full of counsel,
<lb/>Instruction, knowledge, and the praise of God.
<lb/>It thus began: "From God be praise on those
<lb/>That seek His praise who is the Lord of all
<lb/>That is and is not. All things have their peers,
<lb/>But God is One. Of all that He bestoweth
<lb/>Upon His slaves, on sovereign and subject,
<lb/>Naught is more great than wisdom which illumeth
<lb/>Both. He whom wisdom gladdeneth will walk not
<lb/>The world for ill, and he that chooseth right
<lb/>Ne'er will repent thereof; he cannot savour
<lb/>Ill from the stream of knowledge. Wisdom looseth
<lb/>Man from mishap; may none be wrung therewith.
<lb/>Wisdom’s first token is that one should dread
<pb n="111"/>
<lb/>Ill-doing all one’s years and know oneself;
<lb/>Then must he search the world with wisdom’s eye,
<lb/>For wisdom is the diadem of kings,
<lb/>And jewel of the men of name withal.
<lb/>Thou know'st not thine own measure but dost plunge
<lb/>Thy soul in blood. Now, seeing that I am
<lb/>The monarch of the age, both good and ill
<lb/>Are laid to me. Do thou so reign that right
<lb/>May be preserved, for ill is manifest
<lb/>On all sides. 'Tis not kingly to make raids,
<lb/>And cotton with the ill-disposed. Thy grandsire
<lb/>Was vassal to us and thy sire a slave
<lb/>Before our Shahs, and none of us allowed
<lb/>Arrears in tribute out of Hindustan.
<lb/>Now mark the fortune of the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Who came thence 'gainst Iran. He gave to spoil
<lb/>All that he brought, and writhed for his ill deeds.
<lb/>I see thee also thus disposed, the same
<lb/>Perversity, same Glory, and same Faith.
<lb/>Now I have arms and treasures for the war,
<lb/>My soldiers are devoted and arrayed;
<lb/>Thou canst not stand against my gallant men,
<lb/>And there is not a general in Hind.
<lb/>Thou art conceited of thy might, preferring
<lb/>Thine own rill to the river. Now behold!
<lb/>I have dispatched an envoy to thee, one
<lb/>Of knowledge, eloquence, and high degree.
<lb/>Send tribute or make war and fortify
<lb/>The passes. Be our blessing on his soul
<lb/>Whose warp and woof are equity and wisdom."
</p>

<p>Whenas air’s breath had made the writing dry
<lb/>The writer of the letter folded it,
<lb/>And then the scribe addressed it on this wise:—
<lb/>'From this world’s king, the monarch shrewd of wit,
<lb/>The lord of government, the lord of might,
<lb/>The world’s possessor, generous Bahram Gir,
<pb n="112"/>
<lb/>Who on the day of Ard in month Khurdad
<lb/>Received from Yazdagird the royal crown,
<lb/>Chief of the marches, guardian of the realm,
<lb/>To whom Saklab and Rum are tributary,
<lb/>This to Shangul, who ruleth over Hind
<lb/>From Sind up to the river of Kannuj.'
<note n="1">The Ganges is meant.</note>
<lb/>The monarch sealed the letter with his signet,
<lb/>And then made ready for the chase, but none
<lb/>Of all the host knew of his purposes
<lb/>Except the nobles of his company.
<lb/>Thus he drew nigh to Hindustan and crossed
<lb/>The river of magician-land.
<note n="2">Hindustan. Cf. Vol. i. p. 163.</note> On nearing
<lb/>The palace of Shangul he gazed upon
<lb/>The hall of audience with its gate and curtain.
<lb/>It rose aloft in air, and at the gate
<lb/>There was no lack of arms and equipage,
<lb/>For there stood cavaliers and elephants
<lb/>Amid a din of gongs and Indian bells.
<lb/>He stood there all amazed and lost in thought,
<lb/>Then on this wise addressed the curtain-keepers,
<lb/>The servants and officials of the gate:—
<lb/>"An envoy to this court am I, deputed
<lb/>By conquering Shah Bahram."
</p>

<p>The chamberlain
<lb/>Went to the royal presence from the curtain.
<lb/>They raised it by the king’s command and brought
<lb/>The envoy in with all respect. Bahram Gir
<lb/>Advanced with stately step, and saw a chamber
<lb/>With crystal roof. On drawing near Shangul
<lb/>Bahram beheld him seated on his throne
<lb/>Of majesty, and crowned. The steps that led
<lb/>Up to that golden throne were all of crystal.
<lb/>There sat the king in all his Grace and might,
<pb n="113"/>
<lb/>Arrayed in silver broidered with gold thread
<lb/>Beset with many a gem. Bahram beheld
<lb/>The monarch’s brother on an ante-throne,
<lb/>And wearing on his head a jewelled crown.
<lb/>The minister sat by; the monarch’s son
<lb/>Stood there before the throne. The Shah drew nigh
<lb/>Thereto, did reverence, and paused awhile,
<lb/>Then quickly loosed his tongue. "I have," he said,
<lb/>"A letter written in our tongue on silk,
<lb/>Sent to the king of Hind by Shah Bahram—
<lb/>The world’s lord who possesseth crown and throne."
<lb/>The king, on hearing what Bahram said, bade
<lb/>To bring a golden ante-throne. They set him
<lb/>Upon that seat of gold, and from the gate
<lb/>Called in his comrades. Seated thus he said:—
<lb/>"Exalted king! I will unloose my lips
<lb/>When thou commandest. May both good and greatness
<lb/>Be ever thine."
</p>

<p>Shangul replied: "Proceed,
<lb/>For heaven’s blessing is on those who speak."
<lb/>Bahram rejoined: "That Shah of royal race,
<lb/>Whose like no mother in the world hath borne,
<lb/>The exalted prince, the glory of the state,
<lb/>Whose justice turneth bane to antidote,
<lb/>To whom all potentates are tributary,
<lb/>Whose prey is lions in the chase, and who,
<lb/>On taking up the scimitar in fight,
<lb/>Converteth deserts into seas of blood,
<lb/>In generosity like clouds in spring,
<lb/>In whose sight treasures and dinars are vile,
<lb/>Hath sent the king of Hind an embassy,
<lb/>And letter writ on silk in Pahlavi."
</p>

<head>§ 27
How Shangul received the Letter from Bahram and made Reply</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king, on hearing this, asked for the letter,
<lb/>And marvelled at that chief. A noble scribe
<lb/>Read it, whereat the monarch’s face became
<lb/>Like gall. He said: “O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Haste not to speak, and act not haughtily.
<lb/>Thy Shah displayeth his imperiousness,
<lb/>Witness thy journey hither. Should one ask
<lb/>For tribute out of Hindustan the wise
<lb/>Would disavow him. If thy master speaketh
<lb/>Of host and treasure, and of giving land
<lb/>And cities up to woe... well, other kings
<lb/>Are cranes, I am an eagle; they are dust,
<lb/>I am a sea. None fighteth with the stars,
<lb/>Or seeketh fame by warring with the sky.
<lb/>Worth is much better than the useless talk
<lb/>That maketh wise men hold thee in contempt.
<lb/>Ye have not manhood, knowledge, realm or city;
<lb/>Your share of sovereignty is only loss.
<lb/>My whole land is a hidden treasury
<lb/>Whereon mine ancestors have laid no hand,
<lb/>Beside my store of mail for man and steed,
<lb/>Which, if my treasurer should bring it forth,
<lb/>Would ask for elephants to bear the keys,
<lb/>If mighty elephants could carry them;
<lb/>And should I count my swords and coats of mail
<lb/>The stars would seem contemptible in sum
<lb/>To thee. The earth will not sustain my host,
<lb/>My throne, and mighty elephants. If thou
<lb/>Shouldst multiply a thousand thousand-fold
<lb/>'Twould be the sum of those that call me king.
<lb/>Mine are the jewels of the hills and seas,
<lb/>I am the present mainstay of the world.
<pb n="115"/>
<lb/>The founts of aloe, musk, and ambergris,
<lb/>The hoards of undried camphor and the drugs
<lb/>That cure the suffering, whoever shall ail
<lb/>Throughout the world, are plenteous in my realm,
<lb/>As well as silver, gold, and jewelry,
<lb/>While fourscore kings with crowns of gold up-gird
<lb/>Their loins at my behest. My land is full
<lb/>Of mountain, stream, and chasm; not e’en a div
<lb/>Would find his way across it. From Kannauj
<lb/>Up to the marches of Iran and thence
<lb/>Right to Saklab and Chin the chiefs are all
<lb/>My men and cannot choose but homage me.
<lb/>The watchmen of Khutan, of Hind, and Chin
<lb/>Use in their challenges no name but mine;
<lb/>All speak the praises of my crown and grow
<lb/>More serviceable. In my women’s bower
<lb/>The daughter of Faghfur of Chin invoketh
<lb/>God’s blessing on me—me of all the world.
<lb/>By her I have a lion-hearted son,
<lb/>Whose scimitar despoileth mountains’ hearts.
<lb/>No one since Kai Kaous and Kai Kobad
<lb/>E’er hath concerned himself about this land.
<lb/>Three hundred thousand warlike troops withal
<lb/>Acclaim me. Of allies I have twelve hundred,
<lb/>Who all are wholly in my confidence;
<lb/>All are my kith and kin by long descent,
<lb/>And stand before me here in Hind. Their war-cry
<lb/>Would make the lions of the jungle gnaw
<lb/>Their claws. If there were any precedent
<lb/>For chiefs to slay an envoy out of wrath
<lb/>Thy head and body would I part, and let
<lb/>Thy raiment wail for thee."
</p>

<p>Bahram replied:—
<lb/>"As thou art great, O king! sow not the seed
<lb/>Of wrath. My Shah said: ‘Say to him: "If thou
<lb/>Art wise choose not the pathway of perverseness."’
<lb/>Produce now from thy court two men of lore,
<lb/>Of fluent tongue, and happy in discourse,
<lb/>And if in rede and wisdom they excel
<lb/>One of these men with me then I have done
<lb/>With this thy land, for wise men spurn not words;
<lb/>Or else choose out among the warriors
<lb/>That wield in Hindustan the massive mace
<lb/>A hundred horsemen to fight one of us,
<lb/>And we, what time thy wit and worth shall stand
<lb/>Revealed, will ask not tribute from thy land."
</p>
<head>§ 27 How Shangul received the Letter from Bahram and made Reply</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king, on hearing this, asked for the letter,
<lb/>And marvelled at that chief. A noble scribe
<lb/>Read it, whereat the monarch’s face became
<lb/>Like gall. He said: “O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Haste not to speak, and act not haughtily.
<lb/>Thy Shah displayeth his imperiousness,
<lb/>Witness thy journey hither. Should one ask
<lb/>For tribute out of Hindustan the wise
<lb/>Would disavow him. If thy master speaketh
<lb/>Of host and treasure, and of giving land
<lb/>And cities up to woe... well, other kings
<lb/>Are cranes, I am an eagle; they are dust,
<lb/>I am a sea. None fighteth with the stars,
<lb/>Or seeketh fame by warring with the sky.
<lb/>Worth is much better than the useless talk
<lb/>That maketh wise men hold thee in contempt.
<lb/>Ye have not manhood, knowledge, realm or city;
<lb/>Your share of sovereignty is only loss.
<lb/>My whole land is a hidden treasury
<lb/>Whereon mine ancestors have laid no hand,
<lb/>Beside my store of mail for man and steed,
<lb/>Which, if my treasurer should bring it forth,
<lb/>Would ask for elephants to bear the keys,
<lb/>If mighty elephants could carry them;

<head>§ 28
How Shangul prepared a Feast for Bahram, and how
Bahram displayed his Prowess</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul, on hearing this, said to Bahram:—
<lb/>‘Thy counsel sorteth not with manliness.
<lb/>Abide a season and relax thyself,
<lb/>Why parley to no purpose?”’
<lb/>They made ready
<lb/>A splendid hall. Bahram reposed till noon,
<lb/>And when the Crown that lighteneth the world
<lb/>Had reached its height the feast was all prepared
<lb/>According to the bidding of the king,
<lb/>And zealous servants were about the hall.
<lb/>When they had spread the board before Shangul
<lb/>He bade a servant: “Summon to the feast
<lb/>The envoy of the Iranian king, the man
<lb/>Of fluent utterance and novel aims.
<lb/>Bring his companions too and seat them where
<lb/>Ambassadors are placed.”’
<lb/>Bahram came quickly,
<lb/>Sat at the board and oped his hand to bread,
<lb/>But shut his lips to speech. The eating done,
<pb n="117"/>
<lb/>They set themselves to quaff and called for harpists
<lb/>And wine. The scent of musk rose from the feast,
<lb/>The hall was spread with golden carpetings.
<lb/>Now when the lords were merry in their cups,
<lb/>And recked not of the future, king Shangul
<lb/>Bade two strong men attend, men fit to wrestle
<lb/>Against the Div. These noble athletes came,
<lb/>And girt their loincloths round them. Those two youths
<lb/>Contended lustily and strained and writhed
<lb/>Together. Now Bahram took up a cup
<lb/>Of crystal and the wine confused his brain.
<lb/>He spake thus to Shangul: “O king, bid me
<lb/>To gird me for a bout, for when I wrestle
<lb/>Against the strong I am away from harm
<lb/>And drunkenness.”’
<lb/>Shangul said smiling: “Rise,
<lb/>And, if thou shalt overcome them, shed their blood.”’
<lb/>Bahram, on hearing this, rose to his feet,
<lb/>And boldly bending down the upright form
<lb/>Of him whose waist he clutched (a lion so
<lb/>Might seize upon wild onager) he flung
<lb/>His foeman down so that his bones were broken,
<lb/>And all the colour left his cheeks. Shangul
<lb/>Was in amazement at the victor’s mien,
<lb/>His stature and his shoulders and his strength,
<lb/>Invoked God in the Indian tongue and deemed
<lb/>Bahram to be a match for forty men.
<lb/>When they were all bemused with pleasant wine
<lb/>They left the hall of jewelled tracery
<lb/>And, when the vault of heaven donned musk-hued silk,
<lb/>Both young and old slept after banqueting.
<lb/>Shangul went to his sleeping-place, the wine
<lb/>Had turned his looks and thoughts from king Bahram.
<lb/>Now when the musky-scented Veil was changed
<lb/>To gold, and in the sky the sun appeared,
<pb n="118"/>
<lb/>The king of Indians mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And went forth to the Ground with polo-stick
<lb/>In hand. His servants bore his bow and arrows,
<lb/>And for a while he rode to please himself,
<lb/>Then ordered Shah Bahram to mount and take
<lb/>His royal bow in hand. Bahram replied:—
<lb/>‘I have a number of Iranian horsemen
<lb/>With me, O king! and they are fain to ply
<lb/>The arrow and the polo-stick when bidden
<lb/>By the most noble king.”
</p>

<p>Shangul replied:—
<lb/>‘The arrows and the bow are doubtlessly
<lb/>The mainstays of the cavalier. Do thou,
<lb/>Who hast such limbs and neck and might of hand,
<lb/>String up thy bow and shoot.”
</p>

<p>Bahram Gur strung
<lb/>His bow and urged his steed with shouts. He took
<lb/>And shot an arrow that destroyed the mark.
<lb/>The sportsmen and the warriors ’gan to call
<lb/>Their blessings down upon him, one and all.
</p>

<head>§ 29
How Shangul suspected Bahram and kept him from Iran</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul, misdoubting of Bahram, thought thus:—
<lb/>“This stature, Grace, and skill in archery
<lb/>Resemble not a mere ambassador’s
<lb/>Of Hindustan, of Turkistan, or Persia,
<lb/>But, be he of the Shah’s race or a noble,
<lb/>‘Twere well I call him brother,” smiled and said
<lb/>Thus to Bahram: “Famed, high-born prince! thou art
<lb/>No doubt the Shah’s own brother, being dowered
<lb/>With vigour, strength, and skill in archery,
<lb/>Because the Grace of kings, the might of lions,
<lb/>Are thine. Art thou then but a gallant chief?”
</p>

<p>Bahram said: “King of Hind! discredit not
<lb/>Ambassadors. I am not of the seed
<lb/>Of Yazdagird or Shah. To call him brother
<lb/>Would be a crime in me. A stranger I,
<lb/>Come from Iran, no seeker after knowledge,
<lb/>No sage. Dismiss me for the way is long,
<lb/>And I must not incur the Shah’s displeasure.”
</p>

<p>Shangul replied: “Be not importunate,
<lb/>For I have somewhat still to say to thee.
<lb/>Thou must not be so eager to depart,
<lb/>For hasty going prospereth not. Abide
<lb/>With us and set thy heart at ease. If thou
<lb/>Wilt have not mellowed wine then take it crude.”
<note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>He said thereafter to his own adept:—
<lb/>“I have a secret for thee. If this man
<lb/>Be not sib to Bahram, or in degree
<lb/>Above his paladins, 'twill prove a marvel
<lb/>To wise men’s hearts. We must not trust his words.
<lb/>Address him courteously and say: ‘Abide;
<lb/>There is no cause for thee to leave Kannauj.’
<lb/>Sayst thou: ‘He will detect deceit herein?’
<lb/>If words of mine may terrify his heart
<lb/>It will be better far for thee to speak,
<lb/>And talk to him in convenable terms.
<lb/>Say thus to him: ‘Tis well for thee to gain
<lb/>More estimation with the king of Hind.
<lb/>Now if thou will abide with him, and further
<lb/>His subtle policy, thou shalt possess
<lb/>The goodliest march of Hind because the king
<lb/>Hath thee in high esteem. ’Twill be a land
<lb/>Of never-ending springtide where the streams
<lb/>Breathe of the rose. The fortunate ne’er quit
<lb/>Kannauj where twice a year the fruit-trees bear,
</p>

<p>Where there are treasures, gems, dinars, and drachms,
<lb/>And where drachms can be had hearts are not sad.
<lb/>The king is gracious and for love of thee
<lb/>He smileth when he looketh on thy face.’
<lb/>What time ye meet speak thou whate’er thou knowest
<lb/>To this effect and then inquire his name,
<lb/>For that will joy my heart. Should our land please him
<lb/>Our favours would surpass his excellence,
<lb/>We would appoint him captain of the host
<lb/>Anon, in favour highest in the land.”
</p>

<p>The king’s experienced minister departed,
<lb/>Informed Bahram, and pointed him his way,
<lb/>Then asked his name because without his name
<lb/>No answer would suffice. Bahram changed colour,
<lb/>On hearing this, perplexed for his reply.
<lb/>At length he said: “O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Make me not wan of visage in two realms.
<lb/>I will quit not the Shah for any treasure
<lb/>However much I may be pinched by want.
<lb/>The teachings of our Faith are otherwise,
<lb/>As are our estimations, wonts, and ways,
<lb/>And every one that turneth from his king
<lb/>Is lost by such revolt. No man of wisdom
<lb/>Is eager for addition; bad and good
<lb/>Are transient with us. Where is Faridun,
<lb/>The master of the crown, he that restored
<lb/>The age? Where are those chiefs of royal race,
<lb/>The world-lords Kai Khusrau and Kai Kobad?
<lb/>Thou hast withal some knowledge of Bahram,
<lb/>The young, ambitious, and imperious,
<lb/>Who, if I cross his purpose, will avail
<lb/>To bring the world in ruins on my head,
<lb/>Leave Hindustan not field or fell but bear
<lb/>Off to Iran the dust of Wizard-land.
<note n="2">Cf. p. 112 and note.</note>
<lb/>My better plan is to return to court,
<lb/>And to the purview of the conquering Shah.
<lb/>If thou wouldst have my name it is Barzu;
<lb/>My monarch and my parents call me so.
<lb/>Communicate mine answer to Shangul,
<lb/>For I have stayed long in an alien realm.”
</p>

<p>The minister, on hearing this reply,
<lb/>Told all that he had heard before the king,
<lb/>Who frowned and said: “He holdeth him aloof,
<lb/>But I will take such order that this Light
<lb/>Of hosts shall end his days.”
</p>

<p>There was a wolf
<note n="3">Perhaps for “gurg,” wolf, we ought to read "karg,” rhinoceros.
The word is spelt both with g and k in C. and is made to rhyme with
“aarg,” death, and “tagarg,” hail. Cf. NIN, p. 55, note.</note>
<lb/>Within the monarch’s coasts of bulk so vast
<lb/>That it withstood the wind. The lions fled
<lb/>The woods before it, and the swift-winged vultures
<lb/>The sky. Thereat all Hind was full of fear:
<lb/>Its howlings deafened those most keen of ear.
</p>

<head>§ 30
How Bahram fought with the Wolf at the Bidding of
Shangul and slew it</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul said to Bahram: “O man approved!
<lb/>All enterprises prosper in thy hands.
<lb/>A wood near by my city troubleth me.
<lb/>There is a wolf there like a crocodile,
<lb/>And rendeth lions’ hearts and leopards’ hides.
<lb/>Let it be thine to go against this wolf,
<lb/>And pierce its hide all over with thine arrows.
<lb/>The world may find rest then and by thy Grace,
<lb/>Victorious one! Thenceforth in mine esteem,
<lb/>And that of all this noble company,
<pb n="122"/>
<lb/>Thy station shall be such that evermore
<lb/>The folk of Hind and Chin all shall acclaim thee.”
<lb/>Bahram, the honest, said: “I need a guide;
<lb/>Then by God’s strength, when I behold the beast,
<lb/>Thou shalt perceive its garment soaked in blood.”
<note n="1">Garment for skin as in Job ali. 13.</note>
<lb/>Shangul provided him a guide that knew
<lb/>The creature’s lair and haunt, and then Bahram
<lb/>Went with his trusty guide toward the wood
<lb/>Of that blood-shedding wolf. Much spake the guide
<lb/>About its lair, its height and breadth and bulk,
<lb/>Showed where it was and went back while Bahram
<lb/>Approached apace. Iranians thronged behind him
<lb/>With loins girt for the fray, but when they saw
<lb/>Afar so vast a wood, the monster’s bulk,
<lb/>And lair that it had made, all said: “O Shah!
<lb/>Adventure not; thou wilt surpass the bounds
<lb/>Of hardihood because, however brave
<lb/>Thou art in fight, none hath fought rocks and mountains.
<lb/>Say to Shangul: ‘This may not be. I have
<lb/>No sanction for this combat from the Shah.
<lb/>I fight when I am bidden so that he,
<lb/>On hearing of it, may advance my rank.’”
<lb/>Bahram replied: “If holy God hath given
<lb/>My dust to Hindustan how can I die
<lb/>Elsewhere? That is beyond me.”
</p>

<p>That brave youth
<lb/>Strung up his bow, and thou hadst said: “He holdeth
<lb/>His own life cheap!”
<lb/>He sped toward the wolf
<lb/>With head all rage and heart resigned to death.
<lb/>He grasped his royal bow and, having drawn
<lb/>Some poplar arrows from his quiver, poured
<lb/>His shafts like hail till by that token anguish
<lb/>O’ercame the wolf. On seeing the beast’s end nigh,
<pb n="123"/>
<lb/>Bahram, exchanging bow for sword, smote off
<lb/>Its head, exclaiming: “In the name of God,
<lb/>Who hath not mate or peer and gave to me
<lb/>Such Grace and might! By His command the sun
<lb/>Is bright in heaven.”
<lb/>He bade bring wain and oxen
<lb/>To carry that wolf’s carcase from the wood.
<lb/>They bore it. When Shangul saw it afar
<lb/>He had his banquet-hall decked with brocade,
<lb/>And when the mighty king sat on his throne
<lb/>He set Bahram upon the seat of honour
<lb/>While all the chiefs of Hind, and cavaliers
<lb/>Of Chin, applauded him. The lords all came
<lb/>With offerings and spake thus to Bahram:—
<lb/>"None ever did a deed to equal thine;
<lb/>Its brilliancy is more than eyes can bear.”
</p>

<p>As for Shangul he was both glad and grieved,
<lb/>Appearing cheerful and depressed by turns.
<lb/>There was a dragon, an amphibious beast,
<lb/>Which haunted streams and sunned itself ashore;
<lb/>It, with its breath, could suck huge elephants
<lb/>Down, and raise waves upon the dark blue sea.
<lb/>Shangul spake thus to his companions,
<lb/>His clever confidants: “By turns this envoy,
<lb/>This lion-man, doth please and trouble me.
<lb/>If he remained he would be my support,
<lb/>The ruler of Kannauj and of my realm,
<lb/>But if he goeth from me to Iran
<lb/>Bahram will devastate Kannauj; with such
<lb/>A servitor to such a lord this land
<lb/>Will lose both hue and odour. All the night
<lb/>Have I been musing o’er his case and framing
<lb/>A fresh device—to send him to that dragon,
<lb/>Which surely he will 'scape not. Then shall I
<pb n="124"/>
<lb/>Be censured not on his account if he
<lb/>Will fight with dragons.”
<lb/>So he called Bahram,
<lb/>Told stories of the mighty men, and said:—
<lb/>“God, Author of the soul, hath led thee hither
<lb/>Out of the country of Iran to purge
<lb/>The ills of Hindustan as is the way
<lb/>Of men of name. A matter fraught with pain
<lb/>And travail is confronting us, of travail
<lb/>At first but treasure in the end. If thou
<lb/>Accomplish this depart on thy return
<lb/>With my good wishes home.”
</p>

<p>The Shah replied:—
<lb/>“I may not leave the way of thy behests,
<lb/>But will perform thy bidding faithfully
<lb/>Unless the heaven itself shall turn awry.”
</p>

<head>§ 31
How Bahram slew a Dragon</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul said to Bahram: 'Within my realm
<lb/>There is a dragon—an exceeding bale—
<lb/>Which fareth both by land and stream to hunt
<lb/>The lashing crocodile. Thou mayst devise
<lb/>A scheme to rid thereof the realm of Hind,
<lb/>Whose tribute thou shalt carry to Iran,
<lb/>For all the country will assent thereto,
<lb/>And likewise gifts therefrom of aloe-wood,
<lb/>Of swords, and goods of all kinds, with the tribute."
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: "Great king and sovereign,
<lb/>Whose word is law in Hind! by God, the Just
<lb/>And Holy One's, command I will cut off
<lb/>The footing of the dragon from the earth,
<lb/>But must be shown its lair whereof I know not."
<pb n="125"/>
<lb/>Shangul accordingly dispatched a guide
<lb/>To show it to Bahram who went his way
<lb/>With thirty horsemen, nobles of Iran
<lb/>And swordsmen. Hasting to the stream he saw
<lb/>The dragon mid the gloom, its form, its writhing,
<lb/>And furiousness, fire flashing from its eyes.
<lb/>The nobles of Iran with loud exclaims,
<lb/>And shrewdly troubled at that dragon, said:—
<lb/>"Hold not this dragon as thou didst the wolf,
<lb/>O king! the other day. By one mishap
<lb/>Give not Iran up to the wind, rejoice not
<lb/>Thy foemen here."
</p>

<p>The bold Bahram replied:—
<lb/>"'T must entrust my life to all-just God.
<lb/>If I am doomed to perish by this dragon
<lb/>My time will be not lengthened or decreased
<lb/>By hardihood."
<lb/>He strung his bow, he chose
<lb/>Shafts dipped in bane of milk, and 'gan to shower them
<lb/>Down on the dragon, wheeling all the while,
<lb/>Like horsemen in the fray, to left and right.
<lb/>He sewed up with steel points the dragon's mouth,
<lb/>Whose venom scorched the brambles, then he shot
<lb/>Four arrows at its head, and blood and poison
<lb/>Poured down its breast. The dragon's body failed
<lb/>By reason of those shafts, and all the ground
<lb/>Ran with its gore and bane. Then lightly drew
<lb/>Bahram his sword of watered steel and pierced
<lb/>The dragon’s heart right dourly, hacked its neck
<lb/>With sword and battle-ax, and flung to earth
<lb/>Its lifeless form. The dragon overthrown,
<lb/>He turned in duty to the Lord and said:—
<lb/>"O Judge who judgest righteously! 'tis Thou
<lb/>That slewest this great dragon, for who else
<pb n="126"/>
<lb/>Hath might enough? Thou art Thy servants’ refuge
<lb/>From every ill."
</p>

<p>He sought the king of Hind,
<lb/>The noble chieftain of the Sindian host,
<lb/>And said: "The king is freed from these attacks
<lb/>By His decree—the Judge and Nourisher's."
</p>

<p>Shangul grieved, hearing this, because Bahram
<lb/>Was in the saddle still. He bade that wains
<lb/>And oxen should convey the dragon's carcase
<lb/>To plain from forest, while all Hindustan
<lb/>Invoked upon Iran the All-Just's blessing:—
<lb/>"For there a cavalier like this was born
<lb/>To fight with dragons. One who hath such limbs,
<lb/>Such stature and such bearing cannot be
<lb/>But equal to the king in his degree."
</p>


<head>§ 32
How Shangul became troubled about Bahram and
gave a Daughter to him</head>
<p>
<lb/>All men rejoiced except Shangul whose heart
<lb/>Was pained, the matter made his visage wan,
<lb/>And when night came he summoned his wise men,
<lb/>Both those of his own kin and aliens,
<lb/>And thus he said: “This man of Shah Bahram’s,
<lb/>Who hath such might, such limbs, and mastery,
<lb/>Do what I may, is worsted by no toil!
<lb/>Now if he goeth from us to Iran,
<lb/>And cometh to the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>He will depreciate my host and say
<lb/>That here in Hindustan there is no horseman,
<lb/>And so my foemen may grow insolent.
<lb/>I will behead the envoy, will destroy him
<lb/>By stealth. What say ye? What do ye advise?”
<pb n="127"/>
<lb/>"Bring not thy heart, O king!” the wise men
answered,
<lb/>"To sorrow by such deeds. For thee to slay
<lb/>The ambassadors of kings would be an act
<lb/>Unwise and senseless. No one e’er conceived
<lb/>A thought on this wise. Compass no such plan.
<lb/>Thou wilt be execrated by the chiefs,
<lb/>And people should respect their sovereign.
<lb/>By putting this man’s head within the shears
<lb/>Thou wilt bring longsome trouble on thy land.
<lb/>Forthwith will come an army from Iran,
<lb/>And with a potentate like Shah Bahram;
<lb/>None of us in these regions will survive,
<lb/>And thou wilt have to wash thy hands of kingship.
<lb/>This man is our deliverer from the dragon,
<lb/>And slaying should compensate not his toils;
<lb/>Here hath he killed the dragon and the wolf;
<lb/>Give him more life, not death.”
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Shangul grew gloomy, for the sages’ words
<lb/>Perturbed him. Passing thus the night, at dawn
<lb/>He sent a messenger to Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And, when they were together privily
<lb/>Without a minister or counsellor,
<lb/>Said: “O thou Joy of hearts! thou hast prevailed.
<lb/>Attempt no greater feat. I will bestow
<lb/>My daughter on thee as thy wife, for thus
<lb/>Shall I be profited in word and deed.
<lb/>This done, abide with me, for thou wilt have
<lb/>No colour to depart. I will appoint thee
<lb/>The captain of the host and give thee kingship
<lb/>In Hindustan.”
<lb/>Bahram was in amaze,
<lb/>And mused upon his throne, his birth, and glory.
<lb/>"There is no remedy for one’s own acts,”
</p>

<p>He thought, “and this thing cannot bring reproach;
<lb/>Besides by this I may preserve my life,
<lb/>And look again upon Iranian soil,
<lb/>For, as the case is, we have tarried long;
<lb/>The lion is taken in the fox’s net!”
<lb/>Thus said he to Shangul: “I will obey
<lb/>Thy hest and make thy word my rule of life.
<lb/>However of thy daughters choose me one,
<lb/>Who, when I see her, may obtain my praise.”
<lb/>The king of Hind, on hearing this, rejoiced,
<lb/>And decked his halls with painted silk of Chin.
<lb/>Shangul’s three daughters came like jocund spring
<lb/>In all their bravery, their scents, their colours,
<lb/>And looks, and then he bade Bahram Gir: “Go,
<lb/>Prepare thy heart to see a novel sight.”
<lb/>Bahram Gir went immediately, beheld
<lb/>The hall, and of those moon-faced maids chose one
<lb/>Like jocund springtide, Sapinud by name,
<lb/>All grace and modesty, all wit and charm;
<lb/>On him Shangul bestowed her—one that seemed
<lb/>A straight-stemmed cypress and a smokeless lamp—
<lb/>Then chose the richest of his treasuries,
<lb/>Gave to the moon-faced maid the key thereof,
<lb/>Called for Bahram’s companions, cavaliers
<lb/>Of noble rank and masterful, and gave them
<lb/>Dinars and drachms and every kind of wealth,
<lb/>With camphor, aloe-wood, and ambergris,
<lb/>Steeds, golden trappings, girdles, and for those
<lb/>Of highest rank, gold crowns, while for Bahram
<lb/>He had a turquoise crown and glorious throne
<lb/>Of ivory prepared, and decked his palace
<lb/>Of jewelled tracery. All men of name
<lb/>Within Kannauj resorted to that place
<lb/>Of feasting, waiting on their king with joy.
<lb/>They spent a se’nnight thus with wine in hand,
<lb/>All glad and jocund in the banquet-hall,
<lb/>With Sapinud beside Bahram, the king,
<lb/>Like wine in crystal goblet glittering.

How Faghfur of Chin wrote to Bahram and how he replied</head>
<p>
<lb/>Intelligence came to Faghfur of Chin:—
<lb/>"A man of Grace and courage from Iran
<lb/>Hath reached Shangul as an ambassador,
<lb/>And verily is of heroic race.
<lb/>Great exploits have been wrought in Hind by
<lb/>The hand too of this valiant lion-man
<lb/>Through resolution and the might of fortune.
<lb/>Naught but the crown and throne befitteth him,
<lb/>And on him hath Shangul bestowed a daughter,
<lb/>So that his diadem might reach the moon."
</p>

<p>That mighty world-lord wrote to Shah Bahram
<lb/>A letter superscribed: "From him that is
<lb/>The monarch of the world, the head of nobles,
<lb/>And crown of chiefs, to that ambassador
<lb/>Of Persia who with thirty comrades reached
<lb/>Kannuj," and then proceeded: "I have had
<lb/>Accounts of thee, thou famed and glorious man!
<lb/>About thy wisdom, prudence, and advice,
<lb/>And how thou standest steadfast everywhere,
<lb/>So that the wolf and that notorious dragon
<lb/>Could 'scape not from thy shafts and scimitar.
<lb/>The lady given to thee is my kin,
<lb/>Her dust is worth the whole of Hindustan,
<lb/>And thou hast raised thy head on high by thus
<lb/>Affining with this mighty potentate,
<lb/>While in Iran 'twill magnify the Shah,
<lb/>Whose crown well may bediadem the moon,
<lb/>Because his envoy took fit comrades, reached
<lb/>Kannauj, and clasped a Moon upon his breast.
<lb/>Now bear the toil, come hither, and abide
<lb/>Within this land so long as thou mayst wish.
<lb/>I will illume mine eyes with seeing thee,
<pb n="130"/>
<lb/>And make thy rede the breastplate of my soul.
<lb/>Thou shalt go hence at will. I will not bid thee:
<lb/>'Abide awhile.' So with a robe of honour,
<lb/>And wealth, depart with joy—thou and thy chiefs,
<lb/>Well furnished. 'Tis no shame for thee to come
<lb/>To me; I have no quarrel with the Shah.
<lb/>On no wise be remiss in coming hither,
<lb/>And, when thou wouldst depart, then tarry not."
</p>

<p>This letter reached Bahram Gir and perturbed him.
<lb/>He called a scribe, wrote his reply, and planted
<lb/>A tree within the orchard of revenge.
<lb/>The letter thus began: "I have received
<lb/>Thy words. Thou canst have seen no land but Chin,
<lb/>For thou hast superscribed thy letter thus:
<lb/>'From him that is the monarch of the world,
<lb/>The most exalted of the glorious chiefs.'
<lb/>It is not so; new-fangled majesty
<lb/>Like thine I do not recognise. Bahram Gur
<lb/>Alone is king of kings; we know none other.
<lb/>No man remembereth any king like him
<lb/>In courage, knowledge, Grace, and lineage.
<lb/>Him I acknowledge, as victorious world-lord,
<lb/>And know him greater than all other kings.
<lb/>Again, for what thou saidst about my deeds,
<lb/>And of my toil endured in Hindustan,
<lb/>That too was all the star of Shah Bahram,
<lb/>Who hath Grace, throne, and fame. Accomplishment
<lb/>Is the franians' own, they hold fierce lions
<lb/>Of no account. They all are single-hearted;
<lb/>They worship God, and in their blest estate
<lb/>They fear no ill. Again, if king Shangul
<lb/>Bestowed his daughter on me I achieved
<lb/>That honour by my courage. He is great,
<lb/>By his own courage driveth wolf from sheep,
<lb/>And, thinking good to make affinity
<lb/>With me, bestowed on me his worthy child.
<pb n="131"/>
<lb/>Again, for what thou saidst: 'Arise and come,
<lb/>And I will guide thee unto every good,'
<lb/>'The Shah sent me to Hind, and shall I go
<lb/>To Chin for painted silk? If I propose
<lb/>A course like that he will approve it not.
<lb/>Thou sayest further: 'I will send thee home
<lb/>Enriched with treasures.' God hath set me past
<lb/>The need of clutching after others' goods.
<lb/>I praise Bahram for all his bounty to me,
<lb/>And offer up thanksgiving to my God
<lb/>Three watches of the day and of the night.
<lb/>And fourthly, all the praise that thou hast lavished
<lb/>Upon me in excess of my deserts,
<lb/>This I accept from thee, O king of Chin!
<lb/>And will report it to the Shah. May God
<lb/>Give thee so many blessings that the sky
<lb/>May not distinguish 'twixt their warp and woof."
</p>

<p>Bahram dispatched this letter to the king
<lb/>Of Chin when he had sealed it with his ring.
</p>

<head>§ 34
How Bahram fled from Hindustan to Iran with the
Daughter of Shangul</head>
<p>
<lb/>When with the daughter of Shangul Bahram
<lb/>Consorted she found out that he was Shah;
<lb/>By night and day she wept for love of him,
<lb/>And kept her eyes upon his face. Her father
<lb/>Heard of her love and ceased to doubt Bahram.
<lb/>One day the pair sat happily, discussing
<lb/>Things great and small, and Shah Bahram spake thus:—
<lb/>"I know that thou dost wish me well, so I
<lb/>Will tell to thee a secret; keep it close.
<lb/>I would quit Hindustan. Dost thou consent
<pb n="132"/>
<lb/>Thereto? I will take thee withal, but none
<lb/>Among this folk must know. Within Iran
<lb/>My state surpasseth this and, furthermore,
<lb/>The Almighty is mine aid. If thou wilt go
<lb/>Thy wise decision will promote thy weal,
<lb/>In every place thy title shall be ‘queen,’
<lb/>And thine own sire shall kneel before thy throne."
<lb/>She said: "Exalted one! seek what is good,
<lb/>And turn not from the way of understanding.
<lb/>The best of womankind is she through whom
<lb/>A smile is always on her husband's face.
<lb/>If my pure purposes are not conformed
<lb/>To thy command I joy not in thy life."
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: "Then frame a scheme but tell it
<lb/>To none."
<lb/>She said: "O worthy of the throne!
<lb/>I will, with fortune's aid. Not much removed
<lb/>There is a place where festivals are held,
<lb/>For in the forest there my father feasteth.
<lb/>It is a place that men deem fortunate,
<lb/>And thither gather idol-worshippers.
<lb/>Hence to the forest is a score of leagues,
<lb/>And one must weep before the idols there.
<lb/>That is a place for hunting onager,
<lb/>A place too for the worshippers of God.
<lb/>Both king and host will set forth to the feast;
<lb/>He will not leave a soldier in the city.
<lb/>Go then if thou art minded to depart:
<lb/>Let feasts grow old but be thou young forever.
<lb/>Wait for five days, then when the world’s Light shineth,
<lb/>And he shall quit the city, get thee ready
<lb/>To go thyself."
</p>

<p>His wife’s words pleased Bahram,
<lb/>Who slept not till the dawn for thought.
<lb/>Now when
<lb/>The sun displayed its hand upon the sky,
<pb n="133"/>
<lb/>And dark night packed, he mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And rode forth with his weapons to the chase.
<lb/>He told his wife: "Make ready and tell none;
<lb/>Let us prepare and set out on our way."
</p>

<p>Bahram departed, neared the stream, and saw
<lb/>The baggage of some merchants on the road.
<lb/>They recognised him, and he bit his lip,
<lb/>For they were of Iran—bold travellers
<lb/>O’er sea and land. He bade them offer him
<lb/>No reverence; not even had he told
<lb/>His comrades what he purposed. To the merchants
<lb/>He said: "Shut fast your lips; on that depend
<lb/>Our profit and our loss, for if in Hind
<lb/>This secret be divulged the Iranian soil
<lb/>Will be as seas of blood. Enlarged is he
<lb/>Whose lips are shut, the tongue must be confined,
<lb/>And both hands open. By a mighty oath
<lb/>Will I bind fast your tongues till I regain
<lb/>My throne. Say thus then: ‘May we turn away
<lb/>From God, the Holy and Supreme, and follow
<lb/>The Div if ever we desert the counsel
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram and contemplate ill-doing.’"
<lb/>When this oath had been taken and confirmed,
<lb/>So that the Shah’s heart was relieved from care,
<lb/>He said: "Guard well my secret, tendering it
<lb/>Like life itself, if ye desire to turn
<lb/>My bondage to a crown; but if the throne
<lb/>Be void of me armed hosts will come from all sides,
<lb/>And leave no merchants here, no Shah, no thane,
<lb/>No host, no throne, no crown."
<lb/>When they perceived
<lb/>The import of his words they came with cheeks
<lb/>All wet with weeping. "May the nobles’ lives
<lb/>Thy ransom be," they said, "and youth and kingship
<lb/>Thy habit. If the treasure of thy secret
<pb n="134"/>
<lb/>Should be revealed our country would resemble
<lb/>A sea of gore! Who dareth contemplate
<lb/>Such things and turn his wisdom to an ax,
<lb/>His counsel to a hatchet?"
</p>

<p>Hearing this,
<lb/>The Shah ’gan praise those honourable men
<lb/>Of Grace and Faith, and fared home ill at ease,
<lb/>Committing to God’s charge his soul and body.
<lb/>He tarried till the banquet-hall was decked,
<lb/>And till the nobles had departed thither,
<lb/>But when Shangul himself prepared to go
<lb/>Bahram’s wife said to him: "Barzu is sick,
<lb/>Would be excused, and saith: ‘Be not concerned
<lb/>For me, O king! The banquet-hall to one
<lb/>That aileth is distasteful, and the king
<lb/>Must know thus much.’"
<lb/>"Let none," Shangul replied,
<lb/>"That aileth think of banqueting."
</p>

<p>At dawn
<lb/>He left Kannauj and hurried to the place
<lb/>Of feasting. When 'twas night said Shah Bahram:
<lb/>"Tis time to go, good wife!"
<lb/>He seated her
<lb/>Upon her paltry and invoked God’s name
<lb/>O’er her in ancient Persian, donned his mail,
<lb/>And mounted too, his lasso in the straps,
<lb/>And mace in hand. He hurried to the river,
<lb/>And found the merchants sleeping. Rousing them
<lb/>He got a skiff in readiness wherein
<lb/>He seated Sapinud. With day begun
<lb/>They came to land, and brightly shone the sun.
<pb n="135"/>
</p>

<head>§ 35
How Shangul followed Bahram, learned who he was,
and was reconciled to him</head>
<p>
<lb/>A horseman from Kannauj sped with the tidings
<note n="1576"/>Of Shah Bahram’s departure, and Shangul,
<lb/>Who heard it from that loyal servant, quitted
<lb/>The chase as swift as fire. He hurried on
<lb/>Until he reached the river where he saw
<lb/>Both Sapinud and brave Bahram. He grieved,
<lb/>Crossed o’er in dudgeon, and upbraided thus
<lb/>His child: “O wicked wanton! thou hast passed,
<lb/>Bold as a lioness, across the river
<lb/>To go Iran-ward with this lusty knave,
<lb/>To desert waste from cultured paradise,
<lb/>Without my knowledge. Now thou shalt behold,
<lb/>Since thou hast left my pillow secretly,
<lb/>The impact of my double-headed dart.”
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: “O thou of evil mark!
<lb/>Why didst thou urge thy steed as madmen do?
<lb/>Thou hast had testimony that in war
<lb/>I am as with the cup and boon-companions.
<lb/>A hundred thousand men of Hindustan
<lb/>Before me would not equal, as thou knowest,
<lb/>One horseman like me and my thirty comrades,
<lb/>Famed, clad in mail, and wielding Persian swords.
<lb/>I will fulfil the Indians’ eyes with blood,
<lb/>And will not spare a soul.”
</p>

<p>Shangul was aware
<lb/>That he had spoken sooth because his prowess
<lb/>And valiancy could not be overlooked,
<lb/>But answered him: “I have foregone my children,
<lb/>My kindred, and allies, have held thee dearer
<lb/>Than mine own eyes, and as the diadem
<lb/>Upon my head, and given thee her whom thou
<lb/>Thyself didst choose. The right is on my side,
<pb n="136"/>
<lb/>The wrong on thine. Instead of good faith thou
<lb/>Hast chosen outrage. Ever hast thou heard
<lb/>Of good faith paid thereby? Shall I tell thee:—
<lb/>‘One of my kin and wise in mine esteem
<lb/>Hath gone off cavalierly, gone conceiving
<lb/>Himself a king?’ What hath a Persian’s heart
<lb/>In common with good faith? He sayeth ‘yea’
<lb/>And meaneth ‘nay’! Thou’rt such a lion’s whelp,
<lb/>In good sooth, as would bathe in their hearts’ blood
<lb/>Its nurses and, when fanged and sharp of claw,
<lb/>Would purpose combat with its fosterer!”
</p>

<p>Bahram made answer: “When thou knowest me
<lb/>How shalt thou call me ill in thought and deed?
<lb/>I shall be unreproached for having gone,
<lb/>Thou wilt not term my heart and conduct evil.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1577"/>
<lb/>The king of kings am I both of Iran
<lb/>And of Turan, the leader of the folk,
<lb/>The mainstay of the brave, and will requite
<lb/>Hereafter thy deservings and behead
<lb/>Thy foes, hold thee as father in Iran,
<lb/>And vex thee not with tribute for thy realm.
<lb/>Thy child shall be the Lustre of the West,
<lb/>And Crown of dames.”
</p>

<p>Astounded at his words
<lb/>Shangul took off his Indian turban, spurred
<lb/>His steed, and from the front of that great host
<lb/>Approached the Shah to make excuse, embraced
<lb/>The king of kings with joy, and sought to amend
<lb/>What had been said. He was rejoiced to see
<lb/>Bahram, prepared the board, and brought the cup.
<lb/>Bahram revealed the secret to Shangul,
<lb/>Discoursed of the concernments of Iran,
<lb/>And said: “Such circumstances and such thoughts
<lb/>Were those that guided me in this affair.”
<lb/>They both of them arose, the drinking done,
<lb/>And each asked pardon of the other one.

<head>§ 36
How Shangul went back to Hind and Bahram to Iran</head>
<p>
<lb/>These two kings—one a worshipper of God,
<lb/>The other an idolater—joined hands,
<lb/>And pledged themselves: "Henceforth we will not sever
<lb/>Our hearts from right, will raze each root of guile,
<lb/>Keep faith for aye, and listen to the words
<lb/>From sages’ lips."
</p>

<p>Shangul too bade farewell
<lb/>To Sapinud, he made his breast the warp
<lb/>And hers the woof. The two kings quickly turned
<lb/>Their backs on one another and flung down
<lb/>The rancour of their hearts upon the dust.
<lb/>One land-ward went, the other river-ward,
<lb/>Apace and glad.
<lb/>When tidings reached Iran:—
<lb/>"The Shah himself with those escorting him
<lb/>Hath come back from Kannauj," the people all,
<lb/>As they were minded, decked the roads and cities,
<lb/>And everywhere strewed money, musk, and saffron.
<lb/>When Yazdagird received the news he gathered
<lb/>The scattered troops. He and Narsi, the high priest,
<lb/>And all the sages, went to meet the Shah.
<lb/>When Yazdagird beheld his sire Bahram
<lb/>He lighted down and bent him to the dust.
<lb/>Narsi, the monarch’s brother, and withal
<lb/>The high priest had cheeks dust-stained but glad hearts.
<lb/>On such wise Shah Bahram came to his palace,
<lb/>Committing soul and body both to God.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He rested when the world grew dark and while 
<lb/>The moon was like a silvern shield, but when
<lb/>Day rent night’s raiment, and the world’s Light showed,
<pb n="138"/>
<lb/>The king of kings sat on his golden throne,
<lb/>Gave audience but refrained his lips from speech.
<lb/>Came all the nobles with the men of lore,
<lb/>And princes of the empire, then the world-lord
<lb/>Rose on his throne and spake words just and holy,
<lb/>First spake of the Creator, then discharged
<lb/>His debt<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> to wisdom, and thus said: "Revere
<lb/>The Almighty in whose ken the manifest
<lb/>And hidden are, Him praise, and unto Him
<lb/>Address thy supplications midst night’s gloom,
<lb/>For he hath given power and victory,
<lb/>And is the Lord of shining sun and moon.
<lb/>All ye that would gain Paradise abstain
<lb/>From evil and foul deeds. Where there is Justice
<lb/>With bounteousness and righteousness the heart
<lb/>Will turn from guile and loss. Let none henceforth
<lb/>Fear me though he possesseth hills of gold,
<lb/>And mines of silver. From your hearts expel
<lb/>All fear and seek addition of all good.
<lb/>The peasant and the thane are one to us
<lb/>When we are judge. When we gave crown and throne
<lb/>To any know that ‘twas from God and fortune.
<lb/>I will strive not to fill my treasury,
<lb/>I would drive not my people from their homes.
<lb/>One treasure only—justice—will I hoard
<lb/>That after death my spirit may rejoice.
<lb/>Thus too, God willing, will my heart grow bright,
<lb/>And fortune smile. Hereby I shall increase
<lb/>Our blessings and direct you to fair fortune.
<lb/>He who hath borne oppression from my troops,
<lb/>Officials, kin, and cavaliers of war,
<lb/>And doth acquaint me not, but keepeth hidden
<lb/>That knavery, is guilty of the crime;
<lb/>Will one so futile ever endeavour greatness?
<pb n="139"/>
<lb/>I call to God for justice on the man
<lb/>That hath concealed the moon behind a cloud;
<lb/>But if your will is other, for men’s motives
<lb/>Are diverse, tell me boldly; haply I
<lb/>May bring to pass your long-conceived desires.
<lb/>Attend to me, do what I bid, and find
<lb/>Your souls’ peace in my counsels."
</p>

<p>Thus he spake,
<lb/>Resumed his seat upon the throne, rejoicing,
<lb/>And set the crown of greatness on his head.
<lb/>The nobles praised him, saying: "May the crown
<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> And signet ne’er lack thee. Realm, crown, and throne
<lb/>All glory in a Shah that is both wise,
<lb/>And of victorious fortune, but with thee
<lb/>Thy hardihood, thy knowledge, and thy Grace
<lb/>Are greater than the throne of king of kings.
<lb/>A Shah like thee the world remembereth not
<lb/>For manliness, for treasure, and for justice.
<lb/>To bless thee is incumbent on us all,
<lb/>Both young and old, and we will glorify thee
<lb/>To God and in the presence of our folk.
<lb/>No Shah hath sat upon this throne of gold
<lb/>Like thee in justice, victory, and might.
<lb/>Thou raisest from the dust the dead by justice,
<lb/>By goodly speech, and by munificence.
<lb/>May God almighty be thine aid, and may
<lb/>The head of fortune’s star be in thy lap."
</p>

<p>The mighty men and sages prosperous
<lb/>Went from the monarch’s throne with songs of joy.
<lb/>Then mounting with his troops he drew anear
<lb/>The precincts of Azargashasp. He lavished
<lb/>His gold and jewels on the mendicants,
<lb/>On those especially that hid their want.
<lb/>The high priest of the Fire-fane of Zarduhsht
<lb/>Came muttering prayers with sacred twigs in hand.
<lb/>The Shah brought Sapinud to him, and he
<pb n="140"/>
<lb/>Instructed her in custom, Faith, and rite,
<lb/>In limpid water and the good religion
<lb/>Bathed her and banned from her dust, rust, and soil.<note n="3">la débarrassa de la poussière et de la rouille de l’idolâtrie. <bibl>Mohl</bibl></note>
<lb/>The Shah unlocked the prisons and began
<lb/>Bestowing gifts of drachms on every man.

How Shangul with seven Kings visited Bahram</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now from his child—the consort of the Shah—
<lb/>Shangul heard of the doings of her spouse,
<lb/>And was desirous to behold Iran—
<lb/>The dwelling of the noble monarch’s daughter.
<lb/>He sent an Indian eloquent and noble
<lb/>As envoy to request the Shah to grant
<lb/>Another treaty to be stored away
<lb/>For record, and the world’s lord had one drawn
<lb/>Like shining Sol in jocund Paradise.
<lb/>The envoy took withal a letter written
<lb/>In ancient Persian by the Shah’s own hand,
<lb/>And went his way.<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> Now when he reached Shangul,
<lb/>And when the monarch of Kannauj had seen
<lb/>Bahram Gur’s letter, he prepared to journey
<lb/>From Hindustan, but hid it from his kindred
<lb/>In Chin. Seven monarchs followed in his train,
<lb/>Escorting Raja Shangul upon his way—
<lb/>The monarch of Kabul, the king of Hind,
<lb/>The king of Sind with troops, the famous king
<milestone unit="calced" n="1580"/>
<lb/>Who ruled Sandal, the monarch of Jandal,
<lb/>A potent prince, the monarch of Kashmir,
<lb/>A man of mastery, and last of all
<lb/>The great and glorious monarch of Multan,
</p>
<p>
<lb/>All coveters of honour, all with crowns,
<lb/>All wearing torques and earrings, all with escorts
<lb/>And camp-equipment, all of them renowned,
<lb/>Of high estate and rank, all exquisite
<lb/>With silver, gold, and gems; their parasols
<lb/>Were all of peacocks’ plumes, their elephants
<lb/>Had housings of brocade, their escorts glittered
<lb/>O’er miles with offerings for the Shah and gifts,
<lb/>Such that dinars seemed worthless in his eyes.
<lb/>Thus king Shangul and those seven kings withal
<lb/>Proceeded stage by stage, and, when they neared
<lb/>Iran with all their precious equipage,
<lb/>The Shah, informed of their approach, arrayed
<lb/>A host to go to meet them while the chiefs
<lb/>Of every city went to welcome them.
<lb/>The king of kings in wisdom old, and wary
<lb/>Though young in years, advanced to Nahrawan.
<lb/>The two illustrious and exalted kings
<lb/>Drew near to one another, both of them
<lb/>Alighted from their steeds and, as they met,
<lb/>Both offering greetings and apologies,
<lb/>Embraced. Both retinues alighted too:
<lb/>The world was full of babble. Much talk passed
<lb/>On matters great and small when thus the kings
<lb/>Of these two kingdoms met. They both remounted,
<lb/>As did their worshipful and famous troops.
<lb/>Bahram Gur set him up within his halls
<lb/>A golden throne draped as the custom was,
<lb/>Set wine upon the board and furnished minstrels.
<lb/>The whole place rang with song. He spread a board,
<lb/>An arrow-flight in length, with roasted lambs<note n="2">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 238 and note.</note>
<lb/>And fowls. The eating done, he held a revel
<lb/>In royal wise—all colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The handmaids and the slave-boys stood around,
<lb/>Throne, hall, and palace were like Paradise,
</p>
<pb n="142"/>
<p>
<lb/>The wine-cups were all crystal, there were chargers
<lb/>All golden, musk, and scents. The revellers
<lb/>Wore jewelled crowns and shoes depict with gems.
<lb/>Shangul was in amazement at the palace,
<lb/>And as he drank he pondered: “Is Iran
<lb/>A paradise or garden where one’s friends
<lb/>Exhale the scent of musk?”
<lb/>Thus to the Shah
<lb/>Said he in private: “Let me see my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram bade eunuchs of the company
<lb/>Conduct him to that Moon. The noble king
<lb/>Went with them and beheld another palace
<lb/>Like spring. When he beheld her on her throne
<lb/>Of ivory, crowned with an amber crown,
<lb/>He came and kissed her on the head, and laid
<lb/>His cheek to hers and wept exceedingly
<lb/>For love of her as did the Fair o’er him.
<lb/>He stroked her hand and speaking of that hall,
<lb/>That palace, and reception-room, he said:—
<lb/>"Behold a paradise! Thou hast escaped
<lb/>A wretched palace and a foul abode.”
<lb/>The gifts that he had brought with him—the purses,
<lb/>The crowns, and slaves withal, the gems and raiment,
<lb/>Whose value none knew how to estimate,
<lb/>He gave to her. He gave great largess too,
<lb/>And that blithe home was like a garth in spring.
<lb/>Departing thence he went back to the Shah,
<lb/>Disposed for drinking by his happiness.
<lb/>Now when the lords were merry with the wine
<lb/>Shangul departed to his couch to sleep,
<lb/>And, when the Veil of musky hue appeared
<lb/>With stars to spot it like a leopard’s back,
<lb/>The revellers betook them to sweet slumber,
<lb/>While all the attendants stood with folded arms.
<lb/>Thus was it till that golden Cup appeared,
<pb n="143"/>
<lb/>Which thou wouldst call the sun, flung off the cloak
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli, and strewed the waste
<lb/>With topazes; then valiant Shah Bahram
<lb/>Went forth to hunt and took the Indian kings,
<lb/>Went to the chase with cheetahs, hawks, and falcons<note n="3">Cf. p. 76, note.</note>
<lb/>Imperious. For a while they did not irk
<lb/>Their hearts, not one of them felt pain and grief
<lb/>As for a month they hunted on the waste
<lb/>Gazelle and onager. Then they returned
<lb/>With instancy to wine and festival.
<lb/>Thus king Shangul, when hunting and when feasting,
<lb/>Ne’er was long absent from the world-lord’s side,
<lb/>Or at the riding-ground, at merrymake,
<lb/>At banquet and at polo, turned his face
<lb/>For one day from the Shah. A long while passed,
<lb/>The Indian king prepared to journey home.
<lb/>He sought his daughter with a loving heart,
<lb/>And stayed with her a while. He bade a slave-boy
<lb/>Bring pen and paper to him, then he sought
<lb/>For phrases scented with black, pounded musk,
<lb/>And wrote in Indian a righteous rescript,
<lb/>As it were ancient Persian. First he praised
<lb/>Him who had washed the world of its distress,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1582"/>
<lb/>Had spread abroad integrity and right,
<lb/>And flung black lies and loss upon the Div:—
<lb/>"I serve upon the way of use and Faith,
<lb/>Not that of anger or for vengeance sake.
<lb/>I have bestowed my daughter Sapinud
<lb/>As wife on Shah Bahram, that noble prince.
<lb/>May he live ever as the king of kings,
<lb/>And be the great ones of the world his slaves.
<lb/>As soon as I shall quit this Wayside Inn
<lb/>Let king Bahram become Rai of Kannauj.<note n="4">Cf. p. 140, note.</note>
<lb/>Transgress not the commandment of that king,
<lb/>And carry my dead body to the fire.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Give up my treasury to Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And therewithal crown, kingdom, throne, and casque.”
<lb/>This deed of gift in Indian characters
<lb/>On silk he gave to Sapinud as hers.

<head>§ 38
How Shangul returned to Hindustan, and how Bahram
remitted the Property-tax to the Landowners</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul abode for two months in Iran,
<lb/>And then dispatched a noble to the Shah
<lb/>To ask permission to depart, both he
<lb/>And his illustrious counsellors, for home.
<lb/>The king of kings consented that Shangul
<lb/>Should start on his return to Hindustan,
<lb/>And bade an archimage to choose among
<lb/>The treasures of Iran—dinars, gems, silver,
<lb/>Gold, thrones and crowns, swords, girdles and brocade,
<lb/>And stuffs uncut—unbounded, countless gifts
<lb/>To give Shangul while for his suite he furnished,
<lb/>To each in his degree, steeds and brocade
<lb/>Of Chin, dismissed them happy and content,
<lb/>And went three stages with Shangul. Besides
<lb/>The gifts he gave them provand to the coasts
<lb/>Of Hindustan.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When Shah Bahram returned
<lb/>He sat in peace upon the throne, but mused
<lb/>Of death and of ill fortune till his heart
<lb/>Ached and his face grew wan. He bade a scribe—
<lb/>A noble archmage who was his vizir—
<lb/>To come to him and bade him to inspect
<lb/>The treasury and reckon up the gold,
<lb/>The gems, and raiment, for astrologers
<lb/>Had told him, and the words had troubled him:

<pb n="145"/>
<lb/>“Thy life will last three score of years, the fourth score
<lb/>Will make thee weep at death,” and he had said:

<milestone unit="calced" n="1583"/>
<lb/>“The first score years will I devote to pleasure,
<lb/>Will set joy as a shoot within my soul,
<lb/>And in the next will justify the world
<lb/>By equity and liberality
<lb/>In public and in private. I will leave
<lb/>No corner waste and will provide for all.
<lb/>In the third score I will entreat the Lord;
<lb/>Perchance He will direct me on my way.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The astrologer said sixty years and three,
<lb/>But of the three the reckoning was not clear,
<lb/>And so the Shah desired sufficient treasure
<lb/>To meet the presage of the astrologer,
<lb/>Else would he have not self-reproach and travail?
<lb/>The treasurer went to the treasury,
<lb/>On hearing this, and laboured at the account.
<lb/>He toiled exceedingly till he had told
<lb/>The total to the monarch’s minister,
<lb/>Who thereupon went to the famous Shah,
<lb/>And said: “For three and twenty years to come
<lb/>In sooth thou wilt need naught. I have allowed
<lb/>For provand, largess, and thy famed troops’ pay,
<lb/>For envoys that arrive from other kings,
<lb/>And from thine own famed provinces, and thou
<lb/>Possessest for these years a treasury filled
<lb/>With silver, gold, and goods.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Bahram took thought, he was too wise to sorrow
<lb/>Beforehand, and replied: “My sway is ending.
<lb/>This world, if thou reflectest, hath three days.
<lb/>Since yesterday is over, and to-morrow
<lb/>Not come, to-day I stoop not under care.
<lb/>As I have means of largess and a throne
<lb/>Of ivory I will have no more tax.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He bade that no tax should be asked thenceforth

<pb n="146"/>
<lb/>From small and great. He set up in each city
<lb/>A man to rouse the drowsy and check strife
<lb/>Wherefrom proceedeth naught save evil deeds.
<lb/>He gave those wise archmages what was needful
<lb/>By way of provand, clothes, and draperies
<lb/>Out of his treasury, and said to them:
<lb/>“Ye must hide nothing good and bad from me.
<lb/>Be ye the arbitrators of disputes,
<lb/>Make no demands that make yourselves vexatious,
<lb/>Report both good and ill, and cut my fears
<lb/>Concerning evils short.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>This thing obtained
<lb/>Throughout the world, and nothing good and bad
<lb/>Remained concealed. Those sages ordered all,
<lb/>But still from every province letters came,
<lb/>Which said: “Through bounty, idleness, and wealth
<lb/>The brains of men are ceasing to be wise.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1584"/>
<lb/>There is such strife and bloodshed in the world
<lb/>That young men set no value on the great;
<lb/>The young men’s hearts are filled with many things,
<lb/>But not with thoughts of Shah and archimage.
<lb/>Their faces they have turned from gain to guile,
<lb/>They have grown troublesome and combative.
<lb/>The peasants, landowners, and unemployed,
<lb/>All give themselves to battle and contention.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When letters of this kind arrived the Shah
<lb/>Was heart-pierced at the bloodshed. In each province
<lb/>He chose officials, wise and understanding
<lb/>As was befitting, and provided them
<lb/>Out of his treasury with food and raiment,
<lb/>The means for largess, and its allocation,
<lb/>And for six months established offices,
<lb/>Requiring of his subjects drachms in payment,
<lb/>And stamping “tax” on silver thus received.
<lb/>The officers wore crowns and had great state.

<pb n="147"/>
<lb/>For six months he received, for six gave back
<lb/>To wretched mendicant and man of birth.
<lb/>He strove in this way to keep men of war
<lb/>From bloodshed and inaugurating ill.
<lb/>Again his agents wrote: “Munificence
<lb/>Hath robbed the world of its security,
<lb/>For they that have the money pay no tax,
<lb/>But only meditate more bickerings.
<lb/>Instead of being crass they have grown cruel,
<lb/>They are all troublesome and quarrelsome.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Gur had perused this letter
<lb/>His heart was troubled at such deeds. He bade:
<lb/>“Treat in accord to God's decree all those
<lb/>That shed blood or employ deceit, that all
<lb/>May find the means of livelihood.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He chose
<lb/>A marchlord full of justice and of knowledge
<lb/>For every province as was fit. He gave them
<lb/>A court-allowance for a year, invoking
<lb/>The Giver of all good. Much time passed by,
<lb/>And then the monarch had a letter sent
<lb/>To those truth-speaking men and correspondents,
<lb/>Whom he had scattered through the world, to ask:
<lb/>“What is there in the world unprofitable,
<lb/>And bringeth injury upon this realm?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They wrote in answer: “Through the monarch’s gifts
<lb/>No man observeth rule and precedent.
<lb/>There is no thought or care for tilth or toil
<lb/>Wherefrom man’s worth deriveth. We behold
<lb/>Draught-oxen straying and the herbage lush
<lb/>In tilth and springing crop.”
<lb/>The Shah rejoined:
<lb/>“Till midday, when the world-illuming sun

<pb n="148"/>
<lb/>Is at its height, the tiller of the soil
<lb/>Must rest not from his work. The other half
<lb/>Is for repose and sleep. If men are fools
<lb/>We can but weep for them. If any lacketh
<milestone unit="calced" n="1585"/>
<lb/>Fruits, seed, and oxen be not stern and harsh
<lb/>Toward him but kind and aid him from my treasures
<lb/>That none may be distressed by indigence.
<lb/>So likewise if the weather causeth loss,
<lb/>And nobody is sovereign o’er the weather,
<lb/>Or locusts anywhere conceal the earth,
<lb/>And eat the herbage to the naked soil,
<lb/>Give compensation from the treasury.
<lb/>Proclaim this edict in the provinces.
<lb/>If there are sterile routes or if the land
<lb/>Be but a waste and all uncultivate,
<lb/>And whether it be owned by rich or poor,
<lb/>From such as I describe demand not aught,
<lb/>And if a man, one of my servitors,
<lb/>Or mine own foster-sire, shall take one mite
<lb/>Him will I bury on the spot alive:
<lb/>God give him neither home nor dwelling-place.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They sealed the letter with the royal ring,
<lb/>And sent the camel-posts a-hurrying.
</p>

<head>§ 39
How Bahram summoned Gypsies from Hindustan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thereafter he sent letters to each archmage,
<lb/>Gave clothing to the mendicants, and asked:
<lb/>“In all the realm what folk are free from toil,
<lb/>And who are mendicants and destitute?
<lb/>Tell me how things are in the world, and lead
<lb/>My heart upon the pathway toward the light.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>An answer came from all the archimages,
<lb/>From all the nobles, and the men of lore:
<lb/>The face of earth appeareth prosperous,
<lb/>Continuous blessings are in every part,
<pb n="149"/>
<lb/>Save that the poor complain against the ills
<lb/>Of fortune and the Shah. ‘The rich,’ they say,
<lb/>‘Wear wreaths of roses in their drinking-bouts,
<lb/>And quaff to minstrelsy, but as for us
<lb/>They do not reckon us as men at all.
<lb/>The empty-handed drinketh with no rose
<lb/>Or harp.’ The king of kings should look to it.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah laughed heartily at this report,
<lb/>And sent a camel-post to king Shangul
<lb/>To say thus: “O thou monarch good at need!
<lb/>Select ten thousand of the Gypsy-tribe,
<lb/>Both male and female, skilful on the harp,
<lb/>And send them to me. I may gain mine end
<lb/>Through that notorious folk.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the letter
<lb/>Came to Shangul he raised his head in pride
<milestone unit="calced" n="1586"/>
<lb/>Over Saturn’s orbit and made choice of Gypsies,
<lb/>As bidden by the Shah who, when they came,
<lb/>Accorded them an audience and gave each
<lb/>An ox and ass, for he proposed to make
<lb/>The Gypsies husbandmen, while his officials
<lb/>Gave them a thousand asses’ loads of wheat,
<lb/>That they might have the ox and ass for work,
<lb/>Employ the wheat as seed for raising crops,
<lb/>And should besides make music for the poor,
<lb/>And render them the service free of cost.
<lb/>The Gypsies went and ate the wheat and oxen,
<lb/>Then at a year’s end came with pallid cheeks.
<lb/>The Shah said: “Was it not your task to plough,
<lb/>To sow, and reap? Your asses yet remain,
<lb/>So load them up, prepare your harps, and stretch
<lb/>The silken chords.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And so the Gypsies now,
<lb/>According to Bahram’s just ordinance,
<lb/>Live by their wits; they have for company
<lb/>The dog and wolf, and tramp unceasingly.
<pb n="150"/>
</p>

<head>§ 40
How the Time of Bahram came to an End</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thus passed he three score years and three, and had
<lb/>No equal in that age. With New Year came
<lb/>The scribe—the wise archmage, his minister—
<lb/>And said to him: “The treasury of the king
<lb/>Of mighty men is void, and I have come
<lb/>For thy command. Those that enjoyed this wealth
<lb/>Expect us not to levy any tax.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The monarch answered: “Take no further pains,
<lb/>For I have passed beyond the need thereof.
<lb/>Resign the world to its Creator—Him
<lb/>Who manifested forth His works. The heavens
<lb/>Will pass away, but God abideth ever
<lb/>To guide both thee and me to what is good.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He slept that night, and early in the morn
<lb/>A countless crowd resorted to his court.
<lb/>They brought together all that were required,
<lb/>And young prince Yazdagird approached the Shah,
<lb/>Who gave him in the presence of the lords
<lb/>The crown and bracelets, torque and ivory throne.
<lb/>Intending to devote himself to God
<lb/>He cast away the crown, he left his seat,
<lb/>And hasted to resign the world’s affairs.
<lb/>At night-fall he was eager for repose,
<lb/>And, when the sun displayed its head above
<lb/>The deep, fear filled his archimage’s heart,
<lb/>Who thought: “The Shah ariseth not from sleep
<lb/>Unless he hath withdrawn him from the lords.”
</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1587"/>
<lb/>Then Yazdagird drew near his sire and spied
<lb/>What froze the breath upon his lips—Bahram
<lb/>With faded cheeks lay dead on gold brocade!
<lb/>The day of gloom is as it was of yore,
<lb/>Sear not thy heart with greed and lust of more.
<pb n="151"/>
<lb/>At death the cores of stones and iron quail,
<lb/>And here thy strivings are of no avail.
<lb/>Thou shouldst be inoffensive and humane;
<lb/>Why seek addition with its biting bane?
<lb/>Woe for that great Shah and his equity!
<lb/>Oh! never derogate his memory.
<lb/>Of fifty monarchs of seed royal sown,
<lb/>Who girt their loins upon the Iranian throne,
<lb/>Bahram Gur had no like in eminence,
<lb/>In justice, puissance, and excellence.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have called king Rustam but vizir
<lb/>To him though Rustam sent his arrows sheer
<lb/>Through mounts of iron, yet was there no delay
<lb/>When Shah Bahram Gur’s term had passed away.
<lb/>What profit had he from his valour’s day?
<lb/>For forty days the Shah bewailed his sire,
<lb/>The host wore raiment black and blue, and when
<lb/>The charnel closed o’er that famed warrior Shah
<lb/>“He bore off bounty,” thou hadst said, “with him.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Sun, moon, and Venus, Saturn, crown, and throne,
<lb/>A Shah, like this one, ne’er will look upon.
<lb/>Woe for that royal mien, that height, and Grace!
<lb/>Woe for that lofty star, that hand, and mace!
<lb/>He decked the throne and crown, from Rum and Chin
<lb/>Took toll and tax, yet passed as he had been
<lb/>Some starving mendicant! When all was done
<lb/>What profited his halls aloft the sun?
<lb/>He and the pauper fare the selfsame path,
<lb/>And each of grief and pain a scantling hath.
<lb/>The dear delights of earth, the sovereign sway,
<lb/>What boot they? Soon thy rule will pass away.
<lb/>Blest is the pious mendicant and wise,
<lb/>Whose ears oft feel the world’s rough pleasantries,
<lb/>For, when he passeth, he will leave behind
<lb/>A good name and a good conclusion find.
<lb/>His portion is in heaven, and in God’s sight
<pb n="152"/>
<lb/>He will have honour, not be in my plight,
<lb/>In miserable case, calamitous,
<lb/>With all that I possess sent Hell-ward thus
<lb/>Beyond recall! No hope in heaven I see,
<lb/>My hand is void, both worlds have ruined me!
<lb/>Now, if I can collect my thoughts again,
<lb/>The rule of Yazdagird shall be my strain.

<div>
<head>XXXVI: YAZDAGIRD SON OF BAHRAM GUR: HE REIGNED EIGHTEEN YEARS</head>
<div>
<head>NOTE</head>
<p>
The length of the reign of this Shah (Isdigerd I, A.D. 438-457),
as given by Firdausi, appears to be about correct. From the point
of view of popular tradition he seems wholly to have been over-
shadowed by his famous father, and his reign consequently is all
but a blank in the Shihnama. Historically it was full of incident,
and Firdausi’s statement —
<quote><l>He sent out countless hosts on every side,</l>
<l>And kept the world secure from enemies,</l></quote>


though it may be only a conventional statement, is correct enough.
He began his reign with a war with Rum, This was soon over,
but was followed by long wars with the Huns and the Haitalians.
Within the empire there were persecutions of the Jews and
Christians, and about A.D. 450 serious trouble in Armenia.
Yazdagird, as we have seen,<note n="1">See p. 4.</note> continued his father’s minister, Mihr
Narsi, in power, According to Mas’udi he fortified the passes in
the Caucasus.<note n="2">MM, ii. 193. Cf. Vol. i. pp. 16 and note.</note>
He was known to his subjects by two titles—“The Clement”<note n="3">ZT, ii. p. 127.</note>
and “ The soldier's friend.”<note n="4">RM, I, ii. 363.</note>
</p>

<p>Of the two sons of Yazdagird it is not certain historically which was
the elder, but as Pirtiz was successful in the struggle for the throne
that followed on the death of his father, he in any case would have
been made out to be the elder in order to regularise the succession,
and the elder he is according to all the Oriental authorities, In
dating his coins he ignored the short reign of his brother Hurmuz.<note n="5">NT, p. 426.</note>

How Yazdagird sat upon the Throne and exhorted the
Captains of the Host</head>

<pb n="154"/>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1588"/>

<p>
<lb/>When Yazdagird became the world’s great king
<lb/>He gathered unto him the scattered troops.
<lb/>There was a conclave of the wise and noble,
<lb/>The great men and the princely archimages.
<lb/>The atheling sat on the golden throne,
<lb/>He shut the door of toil, the hand of evil,
<lb/>And thus began: <q>He that committeth not
<lb/>A wrong is not in danger of the avenger,
<lb/>But when a heart is darkening with envy
<lb/>The Div will be called in to medicine it,
<lb/>For envy causeth greed and grief and want,
<lb/>And is a cruel and revengeful div.
<lb/>Impute not to a foeman’s heart and hand
<lb/>That which displeaseth thee. Humanity
<lb/>Is wisdom’s brother. Wisdom is the crown
<lb/>Upon the head of knowledge. What time thou
<lb/>Conferrest benefits on any one
<lb/>Din it not into him and break his heart.
<lb/>If thou dost good and art longsuffering
<lb/>Thou art not worthless in a wise man’s eyes.
<lb/>If now victorious fortune shall assist me
<lb/>In furthering my wishes in the world
<lb/>I will prepare a roll of righteousness
<lb/>Without an entry of deceit or wrong.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He ruled the world in justice for a while ;
<lb/>The age rejoiced in him and he rejoiced.
<lb/>He sent forth countless hosts on every side,
<lb/>And kept the world secure from enemies.
<lb/>When eighteen years had passed above his head,
<lb/>He grieved because his fortune was bedimmed,
<lb/>Convoked to him the magnates and the sages,
<pb n="155"/>
<lb/>Caused them to kneel before the golden throne,
<lb/>And thus addressed them: <q>This untoward sky,
<lb/>Not knowing fosterling and fosterer,
<lb/>And heeding not the crowns of potentates,
<lb/>Pursueth every quarry in its path ;
<lb/>So now my time is drawing to its close,
<lb/>And all my strength is broken. I bestow
<lb/>The crown, the signet-ring, the host, and all
<lb/>The treasures of Iran upon Hurmuz ;
<lb/>Pay due observance, execute my bidding,
<lb/>And make my will the music of your souls.
<lb/>Although Piruz hath Grace divine and stature,
<lb/>And is the elder brother of Hurmuz ;
<lb/>Yet see I in Hurmuz deliberation,
<lb/>With wisdom, modesty, and aptitude.</q></p>

<p><milestone unit="calced" n="1589"/>
<lb/>He spake and lived a se’nnight afterwards ;
<lb/>Then passed ; the throne wept over him awhile.
<lb/>Be thy years twenty-five, be they five score,
<lb/>Soon will this fleeting show be thine no more,
<lb/>Regard then as a transitory thing
<lb/>Whatever falleth to thy reckoning.

<head>HURMUZ:
HE REIGNED ONE YEAR</head>
<pb n="156"/>
<div>
<head>NOTE</head>

<p>
The earliest coins of Piruz date from his third year as he
reckoned it, counting from his father’s death, so the reign of
Hurmuz (Hormisdas, A.D. 457-459) lasted about two years.<note n="1">NT, p. 426. </note>
Hurmuz probably had the advantage of being on the spot at the
time of Yazdayird’s death, but Pirnz may have had the better
right to the throne,<note n="2">See p. 153. </note> and seems to have owed much to the services
of a leader named Ruhhaim—a scion of the great Mihran clan
which was of Arsacid descent.<note n="3">NT, pp. 114, 139 and notes.</note>
The name is a familiar one to
students of the Shahnima as that of one of those secondary heroes
many of whom--real personages in the Parthian epoch—have been
reflected back to the mythical periods of the poem.<note n="4">See Vol. iii. p.9.</note>
Ruhham, as
we have seen, was one of the Twelve (eleven) Champions.<note n="5">See Vol.iv. p.102.</note>

Whether Pirtiz also received formal help from the Huaitélians is
doubtful, but plenty of nomad tribes would be willing to take
service with him for a consideration, and if they happened to be
within the Haitalian sphere of influence would be regarded as
Haitilians themselves by tradition. For the consideration required
in the text Tabari substitutes Talikin.<note n="6">NT, p. 116 seq. and notes.</note>
This is much more
probable. Tirmid is mentioned because it would represent the
traditional notion of the Oxus being the boundary between Iran
and Tiirdn. On the other hand settlements in the desert, such as
Tilikin, were valuable both for trade and in war.<note n="7">Id.</note> Firdaust’s
statement that Pirtiz pardoned Hurmuz is supported by Dinawari
and Mir Khind, but two out of the three accounts in Tabari say
that Hurmuz was put to death. The third says that he was
imprisoned. In all probability he was executed.<note n="8">Id. 117 seq. and notes, RM, I, ii. 364.</note>

<lb/>Hurmuz succeeded to his father’s throne,
<lb/>And set upon his head the crown of gold,
<lb/>While, thou hadst said, Piruz was all one rage
<lb/>With tears of envy mounting to his eyes.
<lb/>He went incontinent with troops and treasures,
<lb/>And many chiefs, to the Haitalian king,
<lb/>Who was a princeling of Chaghan, a man
<lb/>Of high ambition and possessed of troops,
<lb/>Of treasure, and of power, hight Faghanish.
<lb/>To him Piruz said: <q> O good friend of mine!
<lb/>Two sons were we—the glories of the throne.
<lb/>Our father gave the younger of us twain
<lb/>The royal crown and, having acted thus
<lb/>Unjustly, died. If thou wilt give me troops
<lb/>I have myself wealth, weapons, majesty,
<lb/>And might of hand.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch of Chaghan
<lb/>Replied: <q>'Tis well, thy sire was king himself.
<lb/>I will point out the way to get thy rights,
<lb/>And furnish thee with troops upon these terms:
<lb/>That I shall have Tirmid and Wisagird,
<lb/>To which effect I hold a covenant
<lb/>From Yazdagird.</q>
<lb/>Piruz said: <q>Yea, ’tis well,
<lb/>And thou deservest greater sovereignty.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch gave him thirty thousand swordsmen—
<lb/>A noble army of Haitalians—
<lb/>Wherewith Piruz, the Shah, arrayed a host
<lb/>That darkened sky and moon with flying dust.
<lb/>He fought with king Hurmuz who could not long
<lb/>Endure the stress of war but presently
<lb/>Was taken, and his father’s crown and throne
<pb n="158"/>
<lb/>Grew worthless to him. When Piruz beheld
<lb/>His brother’s face he yearned for love and union,
<lb/>Bade him remount and sped to grasp his hand,
<lb/>Dispatched him to the palace and declared
<lb/>His own conditions. Said Hurmuz to him:—
<lb/><q>Thank God that those who worship Him are wise.
<lb/>My brother taketh from me crown and throne;
<lb/>Be victory both in name<note n="1">Piruz means victorious.</note> and deed his own.</q>

<div><head>PIRUZ
HE REIGNED ELEVEN YEARS</head>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>
<pb n="159"/>


<p>Piruz becomes undisputed Shah. His inaugural speech. The
land is troubled by a severe drought which Piruz takes measures to
mitigate. The breaking of the drought. Piruz builds cities and,
in violation of the treaty of Shah Bahram Gur, makes war upon
the Haitalians, is defeated, and killed.</p>
<note>The reign of Piruz (Perozes, A.D. 459-484) lasted much longer
than eleven years, and seems to have made a deep impression on
the popular mind by reason of its accumulation of mishaps. The
expedition against the Haitalians was preceded by a few months by
a total eclipse of the sun<note n="1">On Saturday, January 14th, A.D. 484. NT, p. 425.</note>—a portent of disaster that well may have
helped to bring about its own fulfilment. Mir Khwand tells us that
this Shah’s sobriquet was “The Valiant.”<note n="2">RM, I, i. 368. </note></note>
<p>A relic of Piruz—a cup engraved with a representation of that
Shah engaged in hunting—is said to be still in existence.<note n="3">RSM, p. 329. </note></p>

<p>§1. Drought is common enough in Iran, and the record shows
that this particular one must have been of exceptional severity.
According to Tabari, the relief measures adopted by Piruz to cope
with the emergency were so efficient that only one man perished
through want.<note n="4">NT, pp. 119, 122.</note> Tabari, of course, is merely giving the statements
of his authorities without comment.</p>
<p>§§ 2-4. According to the account in Tabari, Piruz built three
cities—Ram-Piruz (the Piruz-Ram of Firdausi) in the territory of <pb n="160"/>Rai, another called Rishan Piruz, and a third named Shahram-
Piruz (Firdausi's Badan Piruz) in Azarbaijan.<note n="1">NT, p. 123.</note></p>

<p>The tradition given in the Shahnama of the war between Piruz
and the Haitalians is dominated by the memory of the beloved and
popular Bahram Gur. We have seen how that Shah, after his
triumphant campaign against that people, set up a pillar that was
to mark the boundary between them and the Iranians.<note n="2">p. 92.</note>
The presumption in the poem is that the arrangement then made continued
in force till Piruz refused to be bound by it any longer. His refusal
brought death upon himself and disaster on his host. Clearly, this
was a judgment upon him for violating the treaty made by his
grandfather. Naturally, if Piruz had been successful, a different
popular estimate would have been formed upon his conduct, but as
matters turned out, he was manifestly a wrong-doer for having left
his grandsire’s way and he merely got his deserts. Consequently,
on this occasion, right was on the side of the enemy, and for a time,
the tradition becomes almost pro-Haitalian. Between the memory
of a great popular Shah and the occurrence of a great national disaster
practically nothing remained, and the two are linked together as
cause and effect. Historically, as we know from other sources, the
case was very different. Bahram Gur’s son and successor, Yazdagird,
had plenty of trouble with the Haitalians,<note n="3">p. 153.</note>
and so had, it would seem, Piruz himself before the final disaster overtook him. Once,
if not twice, he had been forced to conclude an unfavorable peace
with them, had found himself in their power, and his son, Kubad,
had on one occasion to remain two years in captivity until a heavy
ransom had been paid. If the story of the help given by the
Haitalians to Piruz against his brother, Hurmuz, at the price of the
cession of Talikan be unhistorical, it was probably at one of these
conclusions of peace that the place was ceded.<note n="4">pp. 156, 157, NT, p. 119, note.</note> Popular tradition
may have preferred to represent Tisfun as being yielded to secure
the throne for the rightful heir rather than as the consideration
for a disgraceful treaty later on. Piruz violated his own compact,
not Bahram’s, and perished in consequence. There are three
accounts of the disaster in Tabari. They are in accord in essentials,
and two of them attribute the proximate cause of the overthrow of
Piruz to the trench dug by the Haitalian king whom these accounts
is called Achshunwar or Akhshunwar approximately, but in the
absence of diacritical and vowel points, the precise form is uncertain. According to one account, it was the evil practices of the

<pb n="161"/>

Haitalian king that impelled Piruz to declare war, and four sons
and four brothers perished with him.<note n="1">NT, p. 120.</note> The second, which comes
from Ibn Mukaffa,<note n="2">For whom see Vol. vi. p. 17; NT, p. 121, note.</note> states that there were two campaigns. In the
first of them, Piruz was led astray by a Haitalian chief, who had
had himself purposely mutilated in order to deceive the Shah, and
forced to sue for peace. Subsequently, wounded honor induced
him to tear up the treaty and renew the struggle in spite of the
advice of his counsellors; he perished, and his baggage, women,
money, and papers fell into the hands of the enemy.<note n="3">Id. p. 123 seq.</note>
In the
third account, mention is made of Bahram Gur’s pillar, and Piruz
is said to have had it thrown down and dragged in front of him
by fifty elephants and three hundred men that he might not be
charged with passing it. This account also states that a daughter
of Piruz was among the captives taken by the Haitalians. Their
king put her into his harem, and she had a daughter who afterwards
married her uncle Kubad.<note n="4">Id. p. 128 seq. and notes.</note> There can be no doubt but that a
terrible disaster befell the Iranian arms in this campaign and, as
we shall see presently,<note n="5">p. 171.</note> the memory of it was reflected back upon
the mythical past and the story retold in connection with the
overthrow of a Pishdadian Shah.</p>

<lb/>Piruz, at ease about Hurmuz and free

<lb/>As well became a Shah that worshipped God,
<lb/>And at the outset thus harangued the chiefs:—
<q><lb/>“Ye worshipful and noble lords! I ask

<lb/>Long life, a due regard for great and small

<lb/>E’en sages are but mortal and possess not

<p>
<lb/>Wise and untouched by evil
<lb/>He ruled one year with justice and good counsel.
<lb/>Next year the face of heaven was dry, the water

<lb/>The third and fourth year it was even so,

<lb/>The mouth of heaven became as dry as dust,
<lb/>And river-water was a precious drug;
<lb/>There was no room to stand, such multitudes
<lb/>Of men and beasts lay dead. The king of kings
<lb/>Beheld that portent, took off tax and toll,
<lb/>And in each city where he kept his stores
<lb/>Bestowed them freely on both small and great.
<lb/>A proclamation issued from the court:—
<lb/>Distribute, O ye men of name and might!
<lb/>Such grain as ye possess and heap instead
<lb/>Your treasuries with coins struck by Piruz.
<lb/>Whoe’er possesseth hoarded stores of grain,

<lb/>He ordered folk to quit their homes,
<lb/>And coming plainwards lift their hands in plaint.
<lb/>A cry of bitter weeping and distress,
<lb/>Of pain and consternation rose to heaven;
<lb/>On hill and waste, in desert and in cave,
<lb/>They called on God for mercy. On this wise
<lb/>For seven years both small and great beheld

<lb/>The eighth year, rose a glorious cloud which rained

<div>
<head>§ 2</head>
<head>How Piruz built the Cities of Piruz-Ram and Badan-Piruz,
and how he went to war with Turan</head>
<p>Now when Piruz had 'scaped that day of stress
<lb/>He sat in peace upon the throne of kingship,<note n="1">The previous section ends here in C.</note>
<lb/>He built himself a city which he bade
<lb/>Call Piruz-Ram, the world hath good thereof,
<lb/>For 'tis the pleasance of the glorious Shahs.
<lb/>He built withal Badan-Piruz, far-famed,
<lb/>A place of peace and joy, now Ardabil,
<lb/>Where Caesar hath of right his boundary.</p>

<pb n="164"/>

<p>Whenas Piruz had prospered all these parts,
<lb/>And made thereby the hearts of wise men glad,
<lb/>He gave a largess to his noble troops,
<lb/>And gat him ready to attack the Turkmans.
<lb/>In that campaign Hurmuz was in the van
<lb/>With troops new-levied; after Shah Piruz
<lb/>Kubad led <note n="1">Reading with P.</note> on the army like a blast;
<lb/>Piruz' pure son was he, wise, and a bough
<lb/>That brought forth fruit. Balash, the younger son,<note n="2">Cf. p. 170.</note>
<lb/>A man of Grace and justice, sat rejoicing
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1592"/>
<lb/>Upon the throne while one of Pars, a man
<lb/>Of high renown called by the king Sarkhan,<note n="3">Sufarai, for whom see pp. 170, 173 seg., 185.</note>
<lb/>Was bidden by Piruz: "Abide thou here
<lb/>As upright minister before Balash."<note n="4">Couplet omitted.</note></p>

<p>Piruz set forward with his troops, his treasure,
<lb/>And gear of war, to fight with Khishnawaz.
<lb/>Now brave Bahram had marked the boundary
<lb/>By setting up a column on the plain
<lb/>With this inscription by the king of kings:—
<q><lb/>"Let not a Turkman or Iranian
<lb/>Transgress this boundary on any wise,
<lb/>Or pass across the river."</q></p>

<p>When Piruz,
<lb/>The lion-queller, reached that spot he saw
<lb/>The mark set by the monarch of Iran,
<lb/>And thus addressed his chiefs: "By this same token
<lb/>Will I erect with scimitar and treasure
<lb/>A tower against the Turkmans so that none
<lb/>May suffer from the Haitalians. When 'tis raised
<lb/>On the Tarak, and when their chiefs shall bring
<lb/>The former treaty, I will say: 'Bahram Gur
<lb/>Did thus by manhood, wisdom, might, and Grace,
<lb/>But I will leave no trace of Khishnawaz,
<lb/>Haitalian or Turkman, high or low.'"</p>

<pb n="165"/>

<p>When Khishnawaz, son of the Khan, had heard:—
<lb/>"The Shah and all his host have crossed Jihun
<lb/>Against the treaty that Bahram Gur made:
<lb/>Fresh war and strife have come upon the land,"
<lb/>A veteran scribe was called by his command.</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>§ 3</head>
<head>The Letter of Khushnawaz to Piruz</head>
<p>He wrote a letter to the king of earth,
<lb/>With<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> praises of him from the righteous Judge,
<lb/>Then said: <q>"Since thou departest from the pact
<lb/>Made by just kings I will not call thee royal.
<lb/>Thine ancestors had acted never so,
<lb/>Those rulers of the world elect and pure.
<lb/>By breaking thus the compact of the Persians,
<lb/>And flinging to the dust the mark of greatness,"<note n="2">"La marque de la frontière établie par les grands" (Mohl).</note>
<lb/>Thou forcest me to break the treaty also,
<lb/>And draw the scimitar in self-defence.</q></p>

<p>He wrote at large and sent too many gifts.
<lb/>A noble cavalier and eloquent
<lb/>Went with the letter which when Shah Piruz
<lb/>Had read he raged against that famous prince,
<lb/>And bade the envoy: <q>"Rise and get thee gone,
<lb/>Return to that base man and say to him:
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1593"/>
<lb/>Bahram concluded terms of peace whereby
<lb/>The country was your own to the Tarak,
<lb/>But now thou hast the whole to the Jihun,
<lb/>Hill, dale, and desert, all alike are thine.
<lb/>Behold! I lead a vast, a noble host,
<lb/>And warriors bent on fight, and I will leave not
<lb/>For long on earth the shade of Khishnawaz."</q></p>

<pb n="166"/>

<p>The envoy came like flying dust and told
<lb/>What he had heard. When Khishnawaz had hearkened
<lb/>Thereto, and read what had been writ to him,
<lb/>He called his scattered followers to horse,
<lb/>Led forth the army to the battlefield,
<lb/>And set upon a lance’s point the treaty
<lb/>Accorded to his grandsire by Bahram
<lb/>To this effect: <q>"Our frontier is Jihun."</q>
<lb/>He chose a man of mark among the troops—
<lb/>One who was shrewd of heart and eloquent—
<lb/>And said: <q>"Approach Piruz with courteous words,
<lb/>Hear his reply, and say: 'I will confront thee
<lb/>Upon the march with thine own grandsire’s treaty—
<lb/>That man of lofty fortune, thine own guide—
<lb/>Set on a spearhead like a shining sun
<lb/>Before the host that all possessed of wisdom
<lb/>May look upon the patent of the just.
<lb/>I shall be praised while thou wilt be condemned,
<lb/>And called 'The impious Shah.' God and his worshippers,
<lb/>And subjects everywhere, will not approve
<lb/>That any one should seek to do injustice,
<lb/>And break the treaties of the kings of kings.
<lb/>None like to Shah Bahram for equity
<lb/>And manhood e’er set crown upon his head.
<lb/>God is my witness, and it is not well
<lb/>To have to make appeal to Him, that thou
<lb/>Art with injustice seeking war with me
<lb/>In falling thus upon me with thy host.
<lb/>Herein thou wilt be not victorious,
<lb/>And likewise get no fruitage from good fortune.
<lb/>Henceforward I shall send no messengers:
<lb/>God will avail to aid me in this fight.'</q>"</p>

<pb n="167"/>

<p>When that haughty Shah had read what Khushnawaz
<lb/>Had written in the letter he was wroth,
<lb/>And said thus to the envoy: <q>"One of years
<lb/>And world-experience would speak not like that;
<lb/>But if from Chach thou comest o’er the river
<lb/>My spearheads are prepared to welcome thee."</q>
<lb/>The messenger returned to Khushnawaz,
<lb/>Spake with him privately at large, and said:
<q>"I see not in Piruz a reverence
<lb/>For God; he hath not wisdom for his guide;
<lb/>He careth only for revenge and strife,
<lb/>And walketh not according to God’s will."</q></p>

<p><milestone unit="calced" n="1594"/>
<lb/>When Khushnawaz had heard these words he sought
<lb/>To God for shelter, making supplication,
<lb/>And saying: <q>"O Thou Judge that judgest right,
<lb/>And art the Master both of wind and dust!
<lb/>Thou knowest that iniquitous Piruz
<lb/>Is not in prowess better than Bahram.
<lb/>He speaketh words unjust and fain would win
<lb/>Addition by the scimitar. Break Thou
<lb/>His foothold from the earth. Oh! may he have
<lb/>No strength, no wit, no heart!"</q>
<lb/>Around his host <note n="1">i.e., where he intended to make his stand.</note>
<lb/>He dug a trench which he made shift to hide;
<q><lb/>"Twas lasso-deep and twenty cubits wide."</q></p>

<div>
<head>§ 4 How Piruz fought with Khushnawaz and was slain</head>
<p>This done, he called on God and marched his powers
<lb/>From Samarkand. On that side Shah Piruz,
<lb/>The frantic, led his troops on like a blast;
<lb/>On this side Khushnawaz with fearful heart
</p>

<pb n="168"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1595"/>

<p>Prayed privily before the holy Judge.
<lb/>The drums and trumpets sounded in both hosts,
<lb/>The air was ebon with the armies’ dust,
<lb/>And from them both such showers of arrows rained
<lb/>That blood ran down like water in a stream.
<lb/>Then, like a dust-cloud, Shah Piruz advanced
<lb/>With mace and Roman helm, and as he drew
<lb/>Nearer to Khushnawaz,<note n="1">The sentence thus far has been translated from P.</note>
<lb/>the Turkmans’ chief
<lb/>Retreated, turned his rein, and showed his back.
<lb/>The foeman followed fiercely. Shah Piruz
<lb/>Spurred forward with few followers and fell
<lb/>With others—chiefs and Lions of the day
<lb/>Of battle—in the fosse, such as Hurmuz
<lb/>His brother, glorious Kubad and others—
<lb/>Great men and princes of the royal race—
<lb/>Till seven had fallen headlong, men of name
<lb/>With golden casques. Then Khushnawaz returned
<lb/>Rejoicing to the fosse and lifted thence
<lb/>The living while the throne bewailed their fortune.
<lb/>Now Shah Piruz, that chief of chiefs endowed
<lb/>With Grace and state, had broken head and back,
<lb/>While of the princes, save Kubad, none lived:
<lb/>Thus host and empire went adown the wind.
<lb/>Then Khushnawaz advanced with heart content,
<lb/>And head exalted with his warrior-host,
<lb/>And gave to spoil the baggage and the foe,
<lb/>For right and left were indistinguishable.
<lb/>They made some prisoners and what numbers more
<lb/>Were stretched by arrows on the sombre soil!
<lb/>‘Tis not for world-lords to be covetous,
<lb/>For hearts that covet are the dark dust’s mate;
<lb/>The never-resting sky ordaineth thus
<lb/>Alike for subjects and for king’s estate,
<lb/>And wringeth its own fosterling, be he
<lb/>A fool or wisdom’s pillar. None can stay
</p>

<pb n="169"/>

<p>Upon this earth of ours eternally.
<lb/>Make right thy provand: naught is left to say.
<lb/>When Khushnawaz had crossed the fosse his troops
<lb/>Lacked not for wealth. They bound Kubad with fetters
<lb/>Of iron, heedless of his throne and race.
<lb/>When tidings reached the people of Iran
<lb/>About the fosse and how Piruz had fought,
<lb/>A wail of anguish went up from the land
<lb/>For all those princes—men of high degree—
<lb/>And when the tidings had been certified
<lb/>Balash descended from his golden seat,
<lb/>Plucked out his royal locks and strewed sad dust
<lb/>Upon the throne. Within Iran the host,
<lb/>The cities and the women, men, and children,
<lb/>All wailed, all rent the hair and tore the face
<lb/>For grief, talked of the Shah and yearned for him;
<lb/>All sat in dole and woe while great and small
<lb/>Took thought what course to choose and whether they
<lb/>Should quit Iran and see where fell the fray?

<head>BALASH: HE REIGNED FIVE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS</head>
<div>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Balash becomes Shah, Sufarai leads forth a host against the Haitalians to avenge the death of Piruz and defeats them. Terms of peace are arranged, Kubad and the other captives are released, and Sufarai returns with them in triumph to Iran. After some years, Sufarai dethrones Balash and makes Kubad Shah.</p>
<note>Balash (Balas, A.D. 484-488) seems to have been the brother, not the son, of Piruz and the uncle of Kubad.<note n="1">NT, p. 133 note.</note> The name is identical with the more familiar Vologeses, Balash being on the spot and regent at the time of the death of Piruz naturally became Shah. Tabari says that he had to fight for the throne with his brother (really his nephew), Kubad, who fled to the Haitalians. The real struggle, however, appears to have been with Kubad’s brother, Zarih, who was defeated and slain,<note n="2">Id.</note></note>

<p>Piruz having expiated by his own death his violation of the treaty made by his grandfather, Shah Bahram Gur, with the Haitalians, popular tradition is at liberty to resume a patriotic attitude and set forth how Piruz was avenged and Iranian honour vindicated. Unfortunately, the account does not appear in the oldest authorities and seems to be unhistorical. Iran at that time was much oppressed by, if not actually tributary to, the Haitalians.<note n="3">Id. 119 note. That the scene of Sufarai’s victory should be laid at Kashmihan, where Bahram Gur had triumphed, is in itself suspicious. See pp. 89, 90.</note> Sufarai’s triumphant campaign seems to have been invented as a salve to the national honour and, incidentally, as a glorification of</p>

<pb n="171"/>

<p>the great family of Karan to which he belonged. The story of his success appears, as Noldeke has pointed out, to have been reflected back into mythical times and told in connection with Naudar, the Pishdadian Shah. Certainly, the parallel is very complete. In both cases, the Iranian host is overthrown by a Northern foe; in both the Shah perishes; in both the scene is laid in the same neighbourhood; in both the defeat is avenged by a Kiran, and in both cases the prisoners are rescued.<note n="1">See Vol. i. p. 345 seq., and NIN, p. 9.</note> In Tabari’s account, Sufarai appears as Sukhra.<note n="2">NT, p. 120 note.</note> As a leading Iranian of the time, he may have been instrumental in bringing about a peace with the Haitalians after the death of Piruz, and this perhaps may be regarded as the historical measure of his achievement.<note n="3">Id., and RSM, p. 332.</note></p>

<p>Balash appears to have been somewhat after the type of Yazdagird, son of Shapur, in character,<note n="4">See Vol. vi. p. 371.</note> mild and tolerant, approved by the Christians and hated by the Magi who, it is said, were scandalised at his attempt to introduce the Roman fashion of public baths, which of course involved a profanation of the sacred element. As his treasury was exhausted, he was unable to look to the army for support, and after a reign of four years was dethroned and blinded. According to other accounts, he died a natural death.<note n="5">NT, pp. 133 seq. and notes; RSM, p. 336 and note.</note> Mir Khwand says that he was known as “the beloved.”<note n="6">RM, Pt. I, Vol. ii. p. 371.</note></p>

<div><head>§ 1</head>
<head>How Balash ascended the Throne and harangued the Iranians</head>
<p>Whenas Balash had mourned one month, with dust
Upon his head and lacerated cheeks,
The people and the high priest came to him
With valiant warriors and famous sages.
They spake with him at large by way of counsel
In profitable words, then seated him
Upon the throne of kingship, showering gold
And jewels over him abundantly.
When seated on the throne he said: <q>“O chiefs!
Acquire the secrets of the sages’ hearts,</q></p>

<pb n="172"/>

<p><q>And ye shall have advancement at my hands
When my dark counsels brighten. Frustrate not
The purpose of well-doers in the world.
As for the wicked and malicious man,
He shall not partner me, but first will I
Enrich him with advice and, if that faileth,
Crown him with blood. When any subject plaineth
To us ’gainst some one of this loyal host
The heart of the unjust one will I break,
And rase him utterly, both root and branch.
See that ye take no freedoms with your Shah,
And in especial one that is devout,
For he by turns is bane and antidote;
So choose the antidote and leave the bane.
Of all things seek to please the Shah and never
Approach his throne unless with joyful looks.
When he is wroth excuse thyself and bless him,
Just or unjust. Whene’er thou sayest: ‘I
Am wise, and I am mighty in all knowledge,’
Know that thou never wast more ignorant,
So be not thine own enemy. If now
Ye shall obey the counsel that I give
By hearkening to my profitable words,
Ye shall receive the treasures of wise Shahs:
I never yet saw knowledge injure any.”</q>
The chieftains marvelled at his understanding,
And called down praises on him, while the troops
Spake thus to one another: <q>“From this Shah
Will fall a lustre on the throne and crown.
God grant that he escape the evil eye,
And ill befall the persons of his foes.”</q>
They went forth from his palace well content,
Committing to God’s care his soul and body.
Their hearts were full of love, their tongues of praise:—
<q>“May such a Shah have endless length of days.”</q></p>

How Sufarai had Tidings of the Slaying of Piruz, how he wrote
a Letter to Khushnawaz, and how Khushnawaz replied</head>
<p>
<lb/>What time Piruz was going to the war
<lb/>He sought a paladin—a man of counsel
<lb/>And weight—to watch o’er crown and throne, and be
<lb/>A friend to young Balash. Now Sufarai—
<lb/>A man of great estate and good withal—
<lb/>Was fitted for that task, experienced,
<lb/>A native of Shiraz, a general,
<lb/>A man exalted both in heart and head,
<lb/>And likewise marchlord in Zabulistan,
<lb/>Kabulistan, Ghaznin, and Bust. When tidings
<lb/>About Piruz, uncounselled and unguided,
<lb/>Came his eyelashes drenched his cheeks with tears,
<lb/>He rent his raiment of a paladin,
<lb/>The warriors doffed their helmets and sat mourning
<lb/>Through sorrow for the Shah, while Sufarai
<lb/>Exclaimed: ‘How shall Balash, youth that he is,
<lb/>Seek vengeance for Piruz?’ for well he knew
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1597"/>
<lb/>That that would naught avail and that the throne
<lb/>Of kingship was in evil case. He gathered
<lb/>His scattered soldiers, beat the kettledrums,
<lb/>And dust rose from the plain. There came to him
<lb/>A hundred thousand warlike, vengeful swordsmen.
<lb/>He paid, equipped the host, and joyed the hearts
<lb/>Of all that sought for vengeance. Then he called
<lb/>A sweet-tongued envoy watchful, wise, and shrewd,
<lb/>And, seared and sorry, wan and weeping, wrote
<lb/>A letter of wise counsels, instancing
<lb/>Jamshid and Kai Khusrau and Kai Kobad,
<lb/>Dispatched it to Balash, and said: ‘O Shah!
<lb/>Be not aggrieved at death; it is a grief
<lb/>That all must taste; choose patience and choose fame.
</p>
<pb n="174"/>
<p>
<lb/>What came from wind returneth with the breath:
<lb/>Some call it justice and some tyranny.
<lb/>Now with the approbation of the king
<lb/>Will I make ready for revenge and strife
<lb/>Because the sun and moon cry out in heaven
<lb/>For vengeance for the blood of Shah Piruz.’
<lb/>With that the envoy went upon his way,
<lb/>And Sifarai, all wreakful, for his part
<lb/>Arrayed his army like a pheasant’s plumes,<note n="1">Cf. p. 88, note.</note>
<lb/>
<lb/>And from Zabulistan advanced toward Marv.
<lb/>He chose him out a wary messenger,
<lb/>Who by his words could mollify the heart,
<lb/>And spake on this wise to a scribe: ‘Arise,
<lb/>Because thy pen hath stirring work to do,
<lb/>Indite to Khushnawaz and say: ‘O fool,
<lb/>And knavish doer of the work of divs!
<lb/>Thou art in God’s sight guilty, and thy shirt
<lb/>Shall wail for thee. Whoe’er did deed like thine,
<lb/>Thou faithless one? Thou shalt behold anon
<lb/>The sword of tribulation. Thou hast slain
<lb/>A man without offence—the king of kings,
<lb/>The grandson of the world-lord Shah Bahram—
<lb/>And hast set up a new feud in the world,
<lb/>A feud to be forgotten nevermore.
<lb/>Why, when the din of timbals rose, didst thou
<lb/>Not come and fawn upon him like a dog?
<lb/>Thy grandsire was a poor man of thy tribe,
<lb/>Thy sire was like a slave before Bahram.
<lb/>Lo! I have come to Marv to seek revenge,
<lb/>And I will waste the Haitalians utterly.
<lb/>The captives and whatever booty came
<lb/>Within thy grasp upon that battlefield,
<lb/>I will exact all with the sword of vengeance,
<lb/>And bear to Marv Turan’s dust, suffer not
<lb/>The world to be thy son’s, burn all thy kith
<lb/>And kin, cut off thy head by God’s command,
<lb/>And make thy kingdom like a sea of blood.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1598"/>
<lb/>But this is not revenge; why talk I long?
<lb/>When Khushnawaz, in that he slew Piruz,
<lb/>Shall rot in darksome dust his soul shall plead
<lb/>His cause from Hell.’’
<lb/>The envoy with the letter
<lb/>Of Sufarai went like a mighty lion,
<lb/>Came in an angry mood to Khushnawaz,
<lb/>Appeared before his throne, did reverence,
<lb/>And gave the letter, while the captains present
<lb/>Withdrew. The monarch gave it to a scribe,
<lb/>And said: ‘Read out to me in confidence
<lb/>Both good and ill.’
</p>
<p>
The scribe thus answered him:—
<lb/>‘This letter is all arrow, mace, and sword,’
<lb/>And sorely grieved was valiant Khushnawaz
<lb/>At that long letter writ by Sufarai,
<lb/>Then set himself without delay to answer
<lb/>The good and ill there written and began:—
<lb/>‘I live in fear of God and fortune’s changes.
<lb/>A worshipper of His would not have broken
<lb/>The compact of the Shahs. I sent Piruz
<lb/>A letter of advice besides the treaty
<lb/>Of that great king, <note n="1">Bahram Gur. See p. 166.</note> but he despised my words,
<lb/>And spurned the old king’s pact. When he assailed me,
<lb/>And put me to a shift, and when the hosts
<lb/>Met face to face, the stars raged at Piruz,
<lb/>And by no will of ours thy Shah was slain.
<lb/>Or e’er he broke the pact of righteous Shahs
<lb/>His youth had not another day of joy;
<lb/>He found <note n="2">Reading with P.</note> no favour in the Maker’s eyes;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: ‘Earth took him by the heel.’ <note n="3">“Foot” in the original.</note>
</p>
<pb n="176"/>
<p>
<lb/>The man that breaketh his forefather’s treaty,
<lb/>And flingeth underfoot the head of right,
<lb/>Is like Piruz upon the battlefield,
<lb/>Pashed in a dusty ditch. So shalt thou be
<lb/>If thou shalt come; my wealth and warriors fail not.
<lb/>Departing with the letter and apace
<lb/>The envoy in a week reached Sufarai,
<lb/>Who read and loosed his tongue in malisons.
<lb/>Then from the plain the people heard the blare
<lb/>Of trumpets and the clash of brazen cymbals,
<lb/>And Sufarai led forth to Kashmihan
<lb/>A host so great that Sol was lost in heaven.
<lb/>'Twas thus they crossed the stream—an armament
<lb/>That made itself at home where’er it went.

How Sifarai fought with Khushnawaz, and how Kubad
was released from his Bondage</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1599"/>
<p>
<lb/>When tidings came to Khushnawaz he marched
<lb/>Out to the desert and prepared for war.
<lb/>He reached Baigand and chose a battlefield
<lb/>That hid the wilderness from circling heaven
<lb/>With troops.
<lb/>On his side vengeful Sifarai
<lb/>Came onward like a blast. When it was night
<lb/>That leader of the army occupied
<lb/>All the approaches with fresh elephants.
<lb/>The outposts went their rounds in both the hosts,
<lb/>The world resounded with the warriors’ shouts,
<lb/>The challenge of the sentries and the clang
<lb/>Of bells rose from both armies, front and rear,
<lb/>Till Sol rose o’er the peaks and made the dales
<lb/>And deserts like white crystal. Both arrays
<lb/>Prepared for strife; each raised the flag of greatness.
</p>
<pb n="177"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then dragons’ livers sundered at the shouting
<lb/>Of valiant warriors while feathered shafts
<lb/>Made air all vultures’ plumes, and earth became
<lb/>A bath of chieftains’ blood. Where’er one gazed
<lb/>Lay heaps of warriors slain. Then Sifarai
<lb/>Charged from the centre with his troops amain,
<lb/>While Khushnawaz on his side with his sword
<lb/>Of vengeance spurred down from his vantage-ground;
<lb/>But when he saw that fortune proved unkind
<lb/>He turned his rein and showed his back, pursued
<lb/>By Sifarai as ‘twere a raging blast,
<lb/>Who followed with a head-transfixing spear.
<lb/>He captured many nobles; many more
<lb/>Were slain by arrow and by scimitar.
<lb/>He sped till he reached Kuhandizh and saw
<lb/>No lack of slain and wounded on the way.
<lb/>Then from the ramparts Khushnawaz beheld
<lb/>His troops spread o’er the desert’s hills and dales;
<lb/>The way was strewn with dead and things of price
<lb/>So that the plain was decked out like a garden.
<lb/>The soldiers carried off to Sifarai
<lb/>The harness, lances, coronets of state,
<lb/>The battle-gear, the girdles, steeds, and slaves,
<lb/>And made a heap as high as Mount Alburz.
<lb/>He paid no heed to all that Turkman spoil,
<lb/>But gave the whole in largess to his troops,
<lb/>And thus harangued the host: "To-day’s affair
<lb/>Hath prospered for us to our hearts’ content
<lb/>Through fortune’s favour, but what time the sun
<lb/>Shall lift its hand in heaven we must not bide
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1600"/>
<lb/>Inactive on the plain but march like lions
<lb/>Upon yon hold to avenge the king of kings."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His troops agreed and each man spake his mind.
<lb/>Thus fared it with them till in arching heaven
<lb/>The sun’s resplendent diadem appeared,
<lb/>Whereat the tymbals sounded in the camp,
</p>
<pb n="178"/>
<p>
<lb/>And Sifarai bestrode his steed. An envoy
<lb/>Reached that proud chief from Khushnawaz to say:—
<lb/>"From battle, strife, and bloodshed naught resulteth
<lb/>But travail and contention. Shall we then,
<lb/>Who are two men of wisdom, young, and brave,
<lb/>Send both our souls to Hell? If thou wilt seek
<lb/>Again the way of wisdom thou shalt learn
<lb/>That all that happened was the work of God.
<lb/>It was not through the blast that Shah Piruz
<lb/>Was slain but rather that the stars foreclosed
<lb/>For him his years and months. He was to blame
<lb/>For breach of pact, for choosing colocynth,
<lb/>And spurning honey. Now what was to be
<lb/>Hath come upon our heads. Blest is the man
<lb/>That walketh not the round of violence.
<lb/>The captives and whatever spoil there was,
<lb/>The gold, the silver, and the uncut gems,
<lb/>The steeds, the weapons, and the crowns and thrones,
<lb/>Left by Piruz when fortune quitted him,
<lb/>Both his own treasures and his troops’ as well,
<lb/>Will I send to the general of the Shah
<lb/>That thou mayst go victorious to Iran,
<lb/>Mayst go back to the monarch of the brave.
<lb/>I will not trespass on Iran; do you,
<lb/>For your part, keep the treaty of Bahram.
<lb/>The king of kings apportioned earth aright:
<lb/>Turan and Chin are ours, Iran is thine."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When Sifarai had heard the embassage
<lb/>He called the soldiers to his tent-enclosure,
<lb/>And in their presence bade the messenger:—
<lb/>"Repeat before the host the foeman’s words."

<p>
<lb/>He came and gave them, keeping nothing back.
<lb/>Then Sifarai addressed his army thus:—
<lb/>"What in your view should be our policy

<lb/>The troops replied: "Tis thine to bid,

<p>
<lb/>Thus to his noble chiefs spake Sifarai:—
<lb/>"The only policy for us to-day
<lb/>Is this—to seek no more to fight with them.
<lb/>I will lead back the army to Iran
<lb/>With speed, because Kubad, <note n="1">Kaikubad in the original.</note> son of Piruz,
<lb/>One of the royal race, is in their hands
<lb/>With the high priest Ardshir and army-leaders,
<lb/>Both young and old. If we fight Khushnawaz
<lb/>The matter will be long and profitless,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1601"/>
<lb/>And they will slaughter their Iranian captives,
<lb/>Kubad, the world’s heir, and Ardshir. Howbeit,
<lb/>Unless Kubad had been in jeopardy,
<lb/>Ne'er had my heart and brain recalled to mind
<lb/>The high priest; but if evil from the Turkmans
<lb/>Befall Kubad, Iran will be all outcry,
<lb/>And this shame current with our warriors
<lb/>Until the Resurrection. We will give
<lb/>A courteous answer to the messenger,
<lb/>And take fair counsels in the cause of peace.
<lb/>We then perchance may see Kubad again,
<lb/>(God grant that no one else be king of kings!)
<lb/>Ardshir the high priest and the other captives,
<lb/>Both young and old."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His soldiers blessed him, saying:—
<lb/>"That is the treaty, precedent, and Faith
<lb/>For us."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The paladin then called the envoy,
<lb/>And thus addressed him with a dulcet tongue:—
<lb/>"It was the act of God—enough! This world
<lb/>Designeth evil and appriseth none.
<lb/>The great men of Iran that have been taken
<lb/>Are these—Kubad and the high priest Ardshir. <note n="2">Reading with P.</note>
</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>
<lb/>These with the rest that have their feet in fetters
<lb/>Dispatch to me in honourable fashion.
<lb/>Moreover all the booty in your hands—
<lb/>Dinars and crowns and wealth of every kind—
<lb/>Dispatch in full to me, and let it come
<lb/>In presence of the chieftains of this host.
<lb/>We will not stretch our hands to spoil and slay
<lb/>Because we have no need and worship God.
<lb/>Within ten days we will recross Jihun,
<lb/>And take no warlike step thenceforth. Give ear
<lb/>To that which I have said and tell it all,
<lb/>On thy return, to Khushnawaz."
<lb/>The envoy
<lb/>Returned forthwith to Khushnawaz in triumph,
<lb/>And gave the message. Khushnawaz rejoiced,
<lb/>And instantly released Kubad from bonds
<lb/>With the high priest Ardshir and all the other
<lb/>Iranian prisoners, collected all
<lb/>The booty found upon the day of battle,
<lb/>Besides the throne and crown of Shah Piruz,
<lb/>And what was scattered 'mongst his troops, and sent
<lb/>All by a trusty man to Sifarai.
<lb/>Now when the soldiers looked upon Kubad
<lb/>They joyed to see him, the high priest Ardshir,
<lb/>And all the other captives young and old.
<lb/>The mighty men came from their tents and all
<lb/>Stretched out their hands to heaven in gratitude
<lb/>That they beheld the king of kings’ own son
<lb/>Unhurt with all the rest that most they prized.
<lb/>Forthwith the chief broke up the camp, took horse,
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1602"/>
<lb/>And glad and triumphing repassed Jihun
<lb/>With that renowned high priest and with Kubad. <note n="1">See p. 179, note.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When tidings reached the country of Iran
<lb/>About that fortunate and glorious chief,
<lb/>About his war and strife with Khushnawaz,
</p>
<pb n="181"/>
<p>
<lb/>And all his wonder-working policy:—
<lb/>"He hath returned glad and victorious
<lb/>From war, Kubad hath been released from fetters,
<lb/>And Sifarai hath brought withal Ardshir,
<lb/>The high priest, and the Iranian prisoners;
<lb/>Just now he crossed o’er the Jihun, his host
<lb/>Is on the plains and mountains of Iran,"
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Such shouts ascended that thou wouldst have said:—
<lb/>"They deafened those that heard." The prudent magnates
<lb/>arose and got themselves in readiness
<lb/>To go forth with their welcome while Balash
<lb/>Prepared a golden throne to seat Kubad,
<lb/>And that chief paladin. When Sifarai
<lb/>Arrived within the realm the great men all
<lb/>Met, while the Shah prepared the welcoming,
<lb/>Set forward with such forces as he had,
<lb/>And when he saw Kubad released from bonds,
<lb/>Glad and victorious, embraced him quickly
<lb/>With joy and cursed the people of Haital
<lb/>And Chin. They passed within the royal palace
<lb/>With hearts still sore and eager for revenge.
<lb/>Balash commanded and they spread the board,
<lb/>And called for wine and harp and minstrelsy;
<lb/>But there was little gladness at that feast
<lb/>Through sorrow for magnanimous Piruz.
<lb/>The singers lauded Sifarai and sang
<lb/>Upon the harp the war against Turan.
<lb/>He was the Cynosure of all the chieftains,
<lb/>Who entertained high hopes and joyed in him.
<lb/>The country rallied to him, those at least
<lb/>That longed to take revenge on Khushnawaz.
<lb/>The hearts of all the paladins rejoiced
<lb/>In Sifarai; they freed their souls from care.
<lb/>Thus was it till four years had passed away,
<lb/>And he had not his equal in the world.
</p>
<pb n="182"/>
<p>
<lb/>Naught happened but according to his will,
<lb/>And what he would he did. Now when his word
<lb/>Prevailed throughout the world he had Balash
<lb/>Removed, albeit gently, from the throne,
<lb/>And said to him: "Thou rulest not the realm;
<lb/>Thou knowest not the good men from the bad;
<lb/>Thou turnest all the empire to a jest
<lb/>Through thy perversity and carelessness.
<lb/>Kubad is wiser far than thou and hath
<lb/>Much more authority within the realm."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Balash withdrew to his own house, for he
<lb/>Dared not make answer: "Get thee gone," but said:—
<lb/>"This throne will vex not when I sit thereon;
<lb/>Tis free from travail, pain, and malison."

Kubad ascends the throne and harangues the chiefs, Sifarai
continues for a time at the head of affairs and then is disgraced and
executed. The Iranians revolt in consequence, hand Kubad over
to Sifarai’s son, Rizmihr, and make Kubad’s brother, Jamasp,
Shah. Rizmihr acts with extreme loyalty, protects Kubad, and
escapes with him to the Haitalians. On the way thither Kubad
marries a thane’s daughter who becomes the mother of Kisra.
Provided with an army by the king of the Haitalians, Kubad
regains the throne. He wars against Rum, builds cities, and becomes
a convert to the teaching of Mazdak who, however, is
worsted in a public disputation by Kisra and put to death with his
followers. Kubad appoints Kisra, to whom the folk give the name of Nushirwan, his successor and dies.

<head>NOTE</head>
<p>
According to Mir Khwand, Kubad (Kobad, A.D. 488-531) was known as “the well-intentioned.” 
<note n="1">RM, Pt. L, Vol. ii. p. 371. The nickname may be illustrated by the following story from the Persian Tabari. Kubad was engaged once in hunting at vintage-time and reached a village where he saw a very beautiful vine. Near by was a woman, engaged in baking bread, who had with her a child some three years old. Suddenly the child entered the garden where the vine was, picked a bunch of grapes, and was about to eat them. The woman slapped the child, took away the bunch, and refastened it to the vine. Kubad, astounded at her parsimony, approached the vine and asked the woman whose it was. She answered that it belonged to her. He then inquired whose the child was, and she told him that it was hers. Then he said: "Why have you taken the bunch of grapes away from it, beaten it, and refused to your own child a paltry bunch." She replied: "We are not free to dispose of our own, for the Shah has a share, and before someone comes on his behalf to deduct his portion we dare not put hand to it." Kubad said: "Do you only or do all folk act thus?" She answered: "Not I alone, but all in the realm of Kubad." The Shah was full of pity for his subjects, narrated the story to his ministers, and bade them find a less oppressive way of raising revenue. They recommended that the whole realm should be surveyed and taxed in proportion to its fertility, remoteness, and distance from water. Then the revenue would be in money which could be demanded at any time. The Shah gave orders accordingly, and the work was begun, but finding that it could not be completed in his own lifetime he charged his son and destined successor, Nushirwan, to see that it was carried through, which he did (p. 224 seq.). —ZT, ii. 152 seq.</note>
</p>
<p>
Historically the events of his reign, as set forth in the Shahnama, may be revised as follows, Sifarai remained at the head of affairs until the revolt occurred that drove the Shah to take refuge with the Haitalians. This revolt was brought about by the conversion of Kubad to the doctrines of the heresiarch Mazdak, who had a large and increasing following. Kubad seems to have been sincere in his adoption of Mazdakism, but at the same time used its subversive principles as a means of reducing the power of, and of humbling, the great nobles. The official hierarchy, however, took alarm, Kubad was dethroned and shut up in the “Castle of Oblivion” in Susiana, and Jamasp, his brother, reigned in his stead. Kubad, however, by the help of his sister, wife, or both, or of Sifarai himself, managed to make good his escape to the Haitalians with whom he had stayed for some two years as a hostage during the lifetime of his father.<note n="2">See p. 160.</note>
</p>
<pb n="184"/>
<p>
During his second sojourn among them he married his own niece—the offspring, by the Haitalian king, of the captive daughter of Piruz. <note n="2">Id. p. 161.</note> Helped by his royal father-in-law, Kubad managed to recover his throne and placed Sifarai again at the head of affairs, but at length, finding him too powerful, called in the aid of his rival—Shapur of Rai, the captain of the host—and had him put to death. Kubad never seems to have abandoned his personal regard for Mazdakism, in spite of the fact that it had cost him the temporary loss of his crown, until nearly the end of his long reign. Probably after his restoration, he was content to hold it as a pious opinion only, no longer as a weapon to be used against the nobility or in a manner provocative of the Magi. The Mazdakites, however, not unnaturally became concerned about the future—what would happen on Kubad’s death? Accordingly, they attempted to secure the succession for one of Kubad’s sons whom they knew that they could trust. Kubad, however, had made up his mind already in favor of another heir, and a great massacre of Mazdakites ensued. This seems to have taken place at the end of A.D. 528 or the beginning of A.D. 529. Kisra, in consequence of the share that he took in exterminating the Communists, received the name of Nushirwan. <note n="1">MM, ii. 196. Cf. p. 211 and note.</note>
</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p>
This account, from which all irrelevant history has been omitted, differs widely, as will be seen, from that given in the Shahnama: Mazdak and his evangel have been replaced in their proper historical context, the story of the birth of Kisra has been omitted, and so has all reference to Rizmihr, Sifarai’s son.
</p>
<p>
§§ 2 and 3. Tabari tells us that when, at the instance of Kubad, Shapur of Rai overthrew Sukhra (Sifarai), a saying, which became a proverb, grew current and ran thus: “Sukhra’s wind is gone; now a wind has risen for Mihran.” Mihran was the name of one of the great Arsacid families that played an important role, and held high office, in Sasanian times, and its employment in the above proverb has led Nöldeke to suspect that “Sukhra” also must be the title of a family, not the name of an individual, as otherwise the two halves of the proverb would not have balanced properly. He is inclined therefore to the opinion that Sukhra and Zarmihr—the Rizmihr of Firdausi—were not two individuals standing in the relation of father and son to each other, but one and the same person—Zarmihr of the family of Sukhra of the house of Karan. <note n="2">NT, pp. 120 note, 140 and note.</note> This house, like that of Mihran, was probably of Arsacid descent, but in Iranian tradition, as we learn from the Shahnama, claimed a much older origin and looked upon Kawa, the smith, who raised the standard of revolt against the tyranny of Zahhak, as the founder of its fortunes. <note n="3">See Vol. i. p. 154 seq.</note> However, this may be, the rivalry between two great families, and the employment by the Shah of one of them to deliver himself from the overgrown authority of the other would be natural enough. It is to be noted that Shapur of Rai is described in the poem as being descended from Mihrak—the mortal enemy of Ardshir Papakan and evidently for some reason or other a very important personage in Iranian legend. He is said to have been of Jahrom in Pars, while Rai, with which his descendant Shapur is associated, was the center of Arsacid power in popular tradition. <note n="4">Vol. vi. pp. 201, 237, 241, 256, 266 seq.</note>
</p>
<p>
Not very long ago we had a Mihran as treasurer to Yazdagird son of Shapur, <note n="1">Id. p. 387.</note> quite lately we found another—Ruhham—helping Piruz in his struggle against his brother Hurmuz, <note n="2">p. 156.</note> presently we shall come upon a third as the opponent of Belisarius, <note n="3">p. 187.</note> a fourth as a general in Nushirwan’s host, <note n="4">p. 251. Cf. NT, p. 139 note.</note> while a fifth—Mihran Siyad—goes on a mission to the Khan. <note n="5">p. 350.</note>
</p>
<pb n="186"/>
<p>
In Kubad’s plans for escape to the Haitalians, he associates himself with six others. Seven is a favorite number in Persian story. We have the Seven Climes, the Seven Courses or Stages of Rustam and Asfandiyar, the Fight of the Seven Warriors, the Seven Feasts of Nushirwan, and other instances. <note n="6">See Vol. vi. p. 207.</note>
</p>
<p>
According to Tabari, Kubad fled twice to the Haitalians, once on the occasion of his unhistorical contention with Balash <note n="7">p. 170.</note> and again, historically, here. On both occasions, he is said to have contracted a marriage on his journey and to have been accompanied by Zarmihr (Rizmihr). This is stated by Tabari with regard to the first flight and by Dinawari and Firdausi as to the second. <note n="8">NT, pp. 135, 145 and note.</note>
</p>
<p>§5. In the above accounts, the birth of Kisri is chronicled in connection with both flights. This duplication does not make the story any more probable, and, as a matter of fact, Kisra appears to have been the son of the sister of one of Kubad’s generals who served in the Roman war, A.D. 502-506. <note n="9">Id. and cf. p. 187.</note> In view of the subsequent importance of Kisra, it was incumbent that Kubad should ask and receive satisfactory assurances as to the descent of the mother of his son. The name Kisra is the Arabic form of the Persian Khusrau, which, with the exception of twelve years, was the name of the Shahs from A.D. 531 to A.D. 627, if we leave out of account the usurper Bahram Chubina.</p>
<p>Jamasp, who, according to Mir Khwand, was known as “the proud,” <note n="10">RM, Pt. I, Vol. ii. p. 371.</note> appears to have reigned for two years, A.D. 496-498, and it is to be feared that his brother’s treatment of him after his deposition was not so amiable as Firdausi would have us believe. The same remark would apply to Jamasp’s adherents, whom also the poet tells us were pardoned. One account at all events states that Kubad “killed the Great” when he regained the throne. <note n="11">NT, p. 461 and note.</note></p>
<p>According to Tabari, Zarmihr (Rizmihr) was put to death by Kubad some time after his restoration. <note n="12">Id. p. 142.</note> The story of the Shah’s ingratitude to the father is duplicated in the case of the son, which in itself is suspicious, as is the almost superhuman loyalty displayed by the latter in § 3. It may be laid to the account of the legitimist view that obtains in this part of the poem. If Sufarai be the Persian commander-in-chief called Seoses in Procopius, he was not put to death till about A.D. 519. <note n="2">NT, p. 145 note.</note></p>
<pb n="187"/>
<p>Until war broke out in A.D. 502, there had been, with one slight exception in the reign of Yazdagird son of Bahram Gur, a period of peace for eighty years between the Persian and Eastern Roman Empires. To both, the defense of the passes in the Caucasus against the incursions of northern Barbarians was equally important, and the understanding was that both should contribute equally to that end. This arrangement formed one of the terms of the peace concluded by Yazdagird with the younger Theodosius after the brief war, above mentioned, in A.D. 442. The Romans, however, were very remiss in carrying out their part of the undertaking, and their money contribution was in arrear. Both parties seem to have been inclined to look upon the money as tribute to be exacted or refused according to circumstances, and this added to the difficulty of an agreement which probably is responsible for the notion often found in Iranian legend that Rum was tributary to Iran. Kubad, after his restoration, found himself in want of money to pay his Haitalian allies and applied to Emperor Anastasius for the arrears due for the defense of the passes. Anastasius refused, his motive being, it is said, the hope of embroiling Kubad with his northern mercenaries, and the Shah declared war. At first, he was very successful, taking Theodosiopolis in Roman Armenia and Amida in northern Mesopotamia, but the generals whom he left to carry on the war, when he himself was called off to resist an Haitalian invasion, were less successful, and Kubad commissioned his brother-in-law, the uncle of Kisra, to negotiate a peace. The Persians received a lump sum and gave up the captured cities. Towards the end of Kubad’s reign, war again broke out, A.D. 526, and lasted till his death. It was in this war that Belisarius rose to fame and fought twice with one of the Mihrans named Piruz. <note n="5">Cf. p. 186.</note></p>
<p>Procopius, who had become secretary to Belisarius in A.D. 527, gives a correspondence purporting to have passed between the two generals. <note n="6">RSM, p. 368 seq. and note.</note></p>
<p>
Hulwan was situated northwest of Kirmanshah at Sar-i-pul-i-Zohab. <note n="7">Id. 564 note; NT, p. 138 and note.</note> Kubad merely renamed it as he also renamed a town
</p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p>
called Arjan on the borders of Ahvaz and Pars not far from the present Behbahan. He changed Arjan to Ramkubad. <note n="1">Id. 13 and note, 146.</note>
</p>
<p>
§§ 6 and 7. In the Vendidad there is a reference to "the ungodly fasting Ashemaogha" (heretic), to which the Pahlavi commentary on the Zand-Avesta adds: "like Mazdak, son of Bamdad." <note n="2">DZA, i. 48 and note.</note> In the late Pahlavi Text known as the Bahman Yasht, the names are given of six priests whom Nushirwan summoned to his aid in his disputation with Mazdak. <note n="3">WPT, i. 194.</note> Two of them are recognizable in Firdausi's Hurmuzd and Mihr-Azar. Mazdak’s place of birth is quite uncertain, and his historical importance began and ended with the reign of Kubad. The poet omits to mention two of Mazdak’s principles—the prohibition of bloodshed and of flesh-eating—but in other respects, his account of that heresiarch’s doctrines seems to be substantially correct—Zoroastrianism with private property and the family abolished. To this anarchical Faith, doubtlessly he did his best to win over Kubad’s recognized heir, failing in which he schemed to alter the succession and perished in the attempt. This seems to be the obvious explanation of the catastrophe. Mani and his followers in their time fared no better. <note n="4">See Vol. vi. p. 359; NT, 465.</note> Nushirwan was far too able and practical to be led away by Mazdak, and on coming to the throne tried his best to repair the mischief that had been done. <note n="5">NT, p. 163. For Mazdak and the Mazdakites generally see id. p. 455 seq.</note>

How Kubad sat upon the Throne and made an Oration to the Iranians</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1603"/>
<p>
<lb/>When glorious Kubad sat on the throne,
<lb/>And donned the crown of majesty, he went
<lb/>To Taisafun, departing from Istakhr—
<lb/>The glory of the great. Now when he sat
<lb/>Upon Piruz’s <note n="6">Or "victorious" or, with a slight change of reading (P), "turquoise," but the translation given is most in accord to the legitimist tendency in this part of the Shahnama. Cf. Vol. vi. p. 251.</note> seat he said: "Conceal
<lb/>Naught from me. By bright day and darksome night
</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>
<lb/>The way to me is open unto you.
<lb/>The man is great who ordereth his tongue
<lb/>To right discourse and seeketh not deceit,
<lb/>While since he will be merciful in wrath
<lb/>The best of men will welcome him as guide.
<lb/>He setteth up the throne of acceptation
<lb/>Within the world, receiving from the great
<lb/>Just commendation. If thou keep'st thy heart
<lb/>Far from revenge both great and small will praise thee,
<lb/>But when the great king is a double-dealer
<lb/>His double-dealing is a call to strife.
<lb/>First hear a matter through for thus apprised
<lb/>Thou wilt reply aright. When any sage
<lb/>Is covetous his knowledge will not fruit;
<lb/>When he is headstrong it will be to him
<lb/>Like water in a salt marsh. Furthermore
<lb/>'Tis well to get a soldier's heart and bear
<lb/>Reproach submissively. <note n="1">Mohl, with a very slight change of reading, translates: “He who seeks the affection of the army takes on a modest tone, even in blaming.” Cf. p. 44.</note>
<lb/>The rich, hard man
<lb/>Is lower even than a mendicant;
<lb/>But when a foolish mendicant hath sway
<lb/>His rule is simple madness. He that knoweth
<lb/>His own defects will not be eloquent
<lb/>On those of others. Patience is the pillar
<lb/>Of wisdom: to be wroth is but to make
<lb/>Oneself despised. Submission to God’s justice
<lb/>Will make thee rich, sincere, and honourable,
<lb/>For thou art freed from care. The body of him
<lb/>That hath no greed is better than a treasure,
<lb/>While that man whose viaticum is knowledge
<lb/>Will die in person but in name live ever;
<lb/>So put ye all your hands to good alone,
<lb/>And walk not on this whirling world for ill.”
</p>
<pb n="190"/>
<p>
<lb/>The nobles all called blessings down on him,
<lb/>And showered emeralds upon his crown.
<lb/>He was a youth of sixteen years, and bore
<lb/>As yet but little part in government,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1604"/>
<lb/>While Sifarai took order for the world.
<lb/>Kubad ruled in the palace; all affairs
<lb/>Were managed wholly by the paladin.
<lb/>He suffered no one to approach the Shah,
<lb/>Who had no archmage and gave no command
<lb/>Or counsel. Sifarai ruled all the land.

<div>

<head>§ 2
How Sifarai went to Shiraz, how the Iranians slandered him to Kubad, and how Kubad slew him</head>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1603"/>
<p>
<lb/>Thus in the cup the wine was tulip-like
<lb/>Until Kubad was twenty-one <note n="1">Reading with P.</note> years old;
<lb/>Then Sifarai came in before the king
<lb/>For licence to go home and thereupon
<lb/>He got him ready with his retinue,
<lb/>Struck up the drums, and started for Shiraz,
<lb/>Returning to his country, full of joy,
<lb/>As one that had obtained his whole desire.
<lb/>All Pars was as it were a slave before him,
<lb/>And, save the throne of empire, all was his.
<lb/>His thoughts were these: “I have set up the Shah,
<lb/>And done him homage as my sovereign,
<lb/>So now if any man shall slander me
<lb/>He will rebuke that man and banish him.”
</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>
<lb/>He levied tribute on the provinces,
<lb/>On all the men of name and all the chiefs.
<lb/>When tidings of his just and unjust deeds
<lb/>came from Shiraz to glorious Kubad,
<lb/>The people said: “The Shah hath but the crown,
<lb/>And not the troops and treasure in Iran,
<lb/>Hath no authority, is not consulted;
<lb/>The world is all the slave of Sifarai.”
<lb/>All those that shared the secrets of Kubad
<lb/>Repeated to him what the people said,
<lb/>And added: “Why, exalted king! art thou
<lb/>Contented merely to be king in name?
<lb/>His treasury is better filled than thine:
<lb/>Thou shouldst release the world from his oppression.
<lb/>All Pars hath grown as ’twere a slave to him,
<lb/>The great men have become his thralls.”
</p>
<pb n="191"/>
<p>
<lb/>These words
<lb/>Seduced Kubad’s <note n="1">See p. 179, note.</note> heart, which became forgetful
<lb/>Of all the services of Sifarai;
<lb/>He said: “If I shall send an army forth
<lb/>He will revolt and seek to be avenged,
<lb/>I shall but use my wealth to make a foe,
<lb/>While he will cause much trouble and much toil.
<lb/>The people all are talking of his deeds,
<lb/>Unwitting of his secret purposes.
<lb/>I know not any warrior of Iran
<lb/>To march against him with a host to battle.”
<lb/>A wise man answered thus: “Think not that he
<lb/>Ever will be recognised as king. Thou hast
<milestone unit="calced" n="1605"/>
<lb/>Both lieges and a leader of the host
<lb/>That can lay hand upon the circling sky;
<lb/>So when Shapur of Rai is on the march
<lb/>The heart of wicked Sifarai will rive.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah took courage when he heard these words,
<lb/>Forgot the merit and presumed the guilt;
<lb/>Then bade a veteran mount as swift as wind,
<lb/>And, on the plea of faring forth to hawk,
<lb/>Go to Shapur of Rai, cause him to mount
<lb/>Forthwith upon his steed, and summon him
</p>
<pb n="192"/>
<p>
<lb/>From Rai to court. The messenger, who took
<lb/>A spare steed, went swift as an autumn-blast
<lb/>To Rai as he was bidden by the king. 
<lb/>The chamberlain there saw and questioned him,
<lb/>Took the king’s letter, went before Shapur,
<lb/>Gave it, and introduced that noble horseman.
<lb/>Shapur, who was descended from Mihrak,
<lb/>Smiled when he read the letter of Kubad, <note n="1">Id.</note>
<lb/>
<lb/>For Sifarai had not a foe like him
<lb/>In public and in private. Thus apprised
<lb/>Shapur convoked his lieges and led forth
<lb/>His army in all haste to Taisafun.
<lb/>When he had brought his army to the Shah
<lb/>They gave him audience instantly. The world-lord,
<lb/>On seeing him, received him graciously,
<lb/>Caused him to sit upon the turquoise throne,
<lb/>And said: “I have no portion in this crown,
<lb/>Am noted ‘mongst the foolish in the world.
<lb/>All power is with Sifarai; I see
<lb/>But sovereignty in name. Late in the day
<lb/>My body shrinketh from the weights that press
<lb/>With justice or injustice on my neck.
<lb/>E’en were my brother master of Iran
<lb/>'Twere better than this unjust Sifarai.”
</p>
<pb n="193"/>
<p>
<lb/>Shapur replied: “O king! be not aggrieved
<lb/>At heart on this account. Thou shouldest write
<lb/>A letter in harsh terms to him, for thou
<lb/>Hast Grace and fame, high lineage and support.
<lb/>Say: ‘Of the crown of king of kings my share
<lb/>Is travail and an empty treasure-house.
<lb/>Thou takest tribute, and I bear the blame.
<lb/>I will not have thee call me Shah henceforth.
<lb/>Lo! I have sent to thee a paladin
<lb/>In that thy conduct causeth me to wail.’
<lb/>When he shall get a letter thus conceived,
<lb/>And I am there with troops prepared for fight,
<lb/>I will not leave him time to wink an eye,
<lb/>Or speak a word to him unless in wrath.”
<lb/>They called to them a scribe and seated him
<lb/>Before Shapur, who said again the words
<lb/>As spoken in the presence of the Shah:
<lb/>The writer wrote them, grieving secretly.
<lb/>Shapur, whenas the Shah had sealed the letter,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1606"/>
<lb/>Led forth his host, then added famous chiefs,
<lb/>Disbanded from the armies of the king,
<lb/>And with those nobles eager for the fray
<lb/>Set face toward the city of Shiraz.

<lb/>When Sifarai had tidings of the matter
<lb/>He marched at once, and with a mighty host—
<lb/>Picked cavaliers in mail—went out to meet
<lb/>Shapur. They met, and those two haughty chiefs
<lb/>Alighted from their steeds. Now when Shapur
<lb/>Sat down with Sifarai they talked at large
<lb/>Of projects good and ill. Shapur then gave
<lb/>The letter of the king, and matters reached
<lb/>A cruel, shameful pass; the paladin,
<lb/>When he had read the letter, changed his favor,
<lb/>Was stunned and dark of soul. Then said Shapur,
<lb/>The letter being read: “I must be plain:
<lb/>The world-lord ordered that thou shouldst be bound,
<lb/>Complaining much of thee before the nobles,
<lb/>And thou wilt gather, having read his letter,
<lb/>That he is resolute.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The paladin
<lb/>Replied: “The monarch of the world is aware
<lb/>What toil and hardship I have borne for him,
<lb/>That marching from Zabulistan with troops
<lb/>I set him free from bondage by my valour,
<lb/>And suffered no calamity to come
<lb/>Upon him. I had influence with the Shah,
<lb/>And with the chieftains of the Iranian host,
<lb/>But since bonds are to be my recompense,
<lb/>And my resistance will be troublesome
<lb/>To thee, I ask no respite. Bind my feet:
<lb/>The fetters of Kubad will profit me.
<lb/>Doth he not shame before God and the host,
<lb/>For I shed freely my warm blood for him?
<lb/>What time the Shah was in captivity
<lb/>I swore by God a mighty oath, and said:—
<lb/>‘My hand shall look but on my falchion’s hilt,
<lb/>And I will cloud the sun in fight, till I
<lb/>Shall give my head or bring down from the throne
<lb/>The head of Khushnawaz between the shears.’
<lb/>And now he biddeth me be bound! Is’t right?
<lb/>Receive I but derogatory words?
<lb/>Still turn not aught from his commands, for know
<lb/>That bonds but ornament a hero’s feet.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Shapur, on hearing this, made fast the fetters,
<lb/>Then bade the trumpet sound and got to horse.
<lb/>From Pars he carried Sifarai before
<lb/>Kubad, who thought not of past services,
<lb/>But bade men bear him to the prison-house,
<lb/>Near where the madmen were, and gave command
<lb/>To carry from Shiraz to Taisafun
<lb/>What wealth soever he possessed—his folk,
<lb/>His treasures, and the produce of his fields—
<lb/>By those appointed to the treasurer.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1607"/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when a week had passed Kubad consulted
<lb/>The archmages how to deal with Sifarai,
<lb/>And thus a counsellor addressed the Shah:—
<lb/>"The whole of Taisafun is on his side—
<lb/>Troops, courtiers, thanes, and populace alike.
<lb/>If he abideth in Iran unscathed
<lb/>Thou mayest wash thy hands of sovereignty.
<lb/>The foe of the Shah is best when killed,
<lb/>His hater’s fortune best when overturned.”
</p>
<pb n="195"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the Shah had heard the archmage’s counsel
<lb/>He took a new course and despised the old,
<lb/>Gave his command that Sifarai be slain,
<lb/>The hearts of all his kindred wrung with pain.

<head>§ 3
How the Iranians put Kubad in Bonds and committed him to
Rizmihr, the Son of Sifarai, and how Jamasp, the Brother
of Kubad, was set upon the Throne</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when these tidings reached the Iranians:—
<lb/>"He of the elephantine form is dead,”
<lb/>A cry of anguish went up from Iran,
<lb/>Men, women, children, all alike bewailed;
<lb/>The tongue of every one was steeped in curses,
<lb/>And secret thoughts found public utterance.
<lb/>Iran was all convulsed, the dust went up,
<lb/>While all folk made them ready for the fight,
<lb/>And thus they said: “Since Sifarai is gone
<lb/>Let not Kubad’s throne be within Iran.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The soldiers and the citizens agreed,
<lb/>They would not bear the mention of Kubad,
<lb/>But marched upon the palace of the Shah,
<lb/>Vexed at his ill advisers, for redress.
<lb/>These men—all malice and intent on evil—
<lb/>They took, dragged from the palace, and then sought
<lb/>With diligence for traces of Jamasp,
<lb/>His younger brother and a noble youth,
<lb/>One whom Kubad had cherished tenderly.
<lb/>They chose him, seated him upon the throne,
<lb/>And called down blessings on him as their Shah;
<lb/>But made Kubad’s feet fast in iron fetters,
<lb/>Unheedful of his Grace and noble birth.
</p>
<pb n="196"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now Sifarai had one son well beloved,
<lb/>A wise man, holy and illustrious,
<lb/>A youth without offence, Rizmihr by name,
<lb/>Whose fame had made his father well content.
<lb/>To him the people gave Kubad in bonds,
<lb/>As unto some malicious enemy,
<lb/>And thought: "Through grief the loving son will take
<lb/>Revenge upon the king for Sifarai.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good Rizmihr, the worshipper of God,
<lb/>Laid not his hand for ill upon the world-lord, <note n="1">Cf. p. 187.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1608"/>
<lb/>But did obeisance to Kubad and spake
<lb/>No words to him about his evil deeds,
<lb/>Whereat the world-lord marvelled much, began
<lb/>To bless Rizmihr, and thus excused himself:—
<lb/>"My foes have troubled much my star and moon,
<lb/>But, if I find deliverance from bond,
<lb/>I will reward thee for all ills endured,
<lb/>For I will banish anguish from thy heart,
<lb/>And cause the eyes that look on thee to shine.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Rizmihr made answer to him thus: "O king!
<lb/>Let not thy soul be grieved on this account,
<lb/>For when a father acted not aright
<lb/>His son should bear the sorrow of his death.
<lb/>As touching mine own self, I am thy slave;
<lb/>I stand before thee as a servitor,
<lb/>And at thy bidding I will swear that never
<lb/>Will I break off my fealty to thee.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>So spake Rizmihr and as the monarch heard
<lb/>His heart began to throb for very joy,
<lb/>His soul regained its confidence and grew
<lb/>Right joyful at the words of that wise man.
<lb/>He made Rizmihr his confidant and said:—
<lb/>"I will not hide my thoughts from thee. Five men
<lb/>Are sharers in my secrets. None besides
<lb/>Hath listened to my voice. Now we will summon
</p>
<pb n="197"/>
<p>
<lb/>These five and ope to them our secret plan
<lb/>If it appears that we have need of them,
<lb/>While if from fetters thou shalt set me free
<lb/>Know this—my policy shall profit thee.”

How Kubad escaped from Ward with Rizmihr, how he wedded
the Daughter of a Thane, and how he took Refuge with the
Haitalians</head>
<p>
<lb/>The good Rizmihr, on hearing this, anon
<lb/>Released Kubad from fetters. From the city
<lb/>They fared forth to the plain by night, unseen
<lb/>By foes, and made toward the Haitalians,
<lb/>Wrung with anxiety and hurrying.
<lb/>On this wise sped the seven like flying dust
<lb/>Until with dizzy heads they reached Ahwaz,
<lb/>And entered on their steeds that wealthy town—
<lb/>A town wherein a famous chieftain dwelt.
<lb/>Dismounting at the dwelling of the thane
<lb/>They tarried there and breathed themselves awhile.
<lb/>He had a daughter moonlike, crowned with musk,
<lb/>And, when Kubad beheld her face, all wisdom
<lb/>Fled from his youthful brain. He went forthwith,
<lb/>And told Rizmihr: “I have a privy word
<milestone unit="calced" n="1609"/>
<lb/>For thee. Haste to the thane. Tell him from me:—
<lb/>‘This moon-faced damsel—could she be my wife?’”
<lb/>Rizmihr went instantly, informed the thane,
<lb/>And said: “If thy fair daughter is unmated
<lb/>I will provide her with a noble spouse,
<lb/>And thou shalt be the master of Ahwaz.”
<lb/>The illustrious thane made answer to Rizmihr:—
<lb/>“My pretty daughter hath no husband yet,
<lb/>And, if she please thee, she is thine to give:
<lb/>Give her to him that longeth after her.”
</p>
<pb n="198"/>
<p>
<lb/>The wise Rizmihr came to Kubad and said:—
<lb/>“May this Moon bring good fortune to the Shah.
<lb/>Thou sawest her unawares and didst approve,
<lb/>Thou didst approve of her just as she was.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad then called to him that fairy-faced;
<lb/>The gallant warrior set her on his knee,
<lb/>And having with him one, and but one, ring—
<lb/>A signet-ring whose worth was known to none—
<lb/>He gave it to her, saying: “Keep this signet;
<lb/>The day will come when I shall ask for it.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He stayed a se'nnight for that fair Moon’s sake,
<lb/>And parted on the eighth day with the dawn,
<lb/>Went to the king of the Haitalians,
<lb/>Told what had chanced, the Iranians’ deeds, and how
<lb/>They all had girded up their loins for ill.
<lb/>The king replied: “The wrongs of Khushnawaz
<lb/>Have surely brought thee to this strait today.
<lb/>On these conditions will I give thee troops,
<lb/>Who are crown-wearers, every one of them,
<lb/>That if thou shalt recover crown and treasure,
<lb/>Chaghan, its wealth and state, its march and rule,
<lb/>Shall be all mine, and thou shalt keep my terms
<lb/>And stipulations.”
<lb/>Said Kubad while smiling
<lb/>At him who thus dictated terms: “I never
<lb/>Will give that land a thought and, when thou wishest,
<lb/>Will send thee troops in numbers numberless.
<lb/>What is Chaghan that I should look that way?”
<lb/>When they had made their pact the Haitalian king
<lb/>Unlocked his treasury and gave Kubad
<lb/>Dinars and arms, and two score thousand swordsmen,
<lb/>All famed as warriors and cavaliers.
<lb/>Thus to Ahwaz from the Haitalians went
<lb/>Kubad; the whole world rang with that event.

<head>§ 5
How Kubad returned from Haital to Iran, how he had Tidings
of the Birth of his Son, Nushirwan, and reascended the
Throne</head>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad approached the thane’s abode and saw
<lb/>In every street a scattered populace,
<lb/>Who all apprised him of the joyful news:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1610"/>
<lb/>“Thy spouse brought forth a son to thee last night
<lb/>But little less resplendent than the moon,
<lb/>And may he bring good fortune to the Shah.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad, on hearing, went within the house
<lb/>In great content. They named the boy Kisra.
<lb/>Now afterwards Kubad asked of the thane:
<lb/>“From whom art thou descended, noble sir?”
<lb/>He said: “From valiant Faridun who took
<lb/>The kingship from the kindred of Zahhak:
<lb/>Thus said my father and my mother too:
<lb/>‘We give our reverence to Faridun.’”
<lb/>Kubad was pleasured yet more at the words,
<lb/>And instantly resumed the royal crown.
<lb/>He had a litter brought and, when his spouse
<lb/>Was seated there, departed on his march;
<lb/>He led the army on to Taisafun
<lb/>In high joy with the Iranians.
<lb/>Now in Iran the while the ancient chiefs
<lb/>Sat with the sages and the notables.
<lb/>They said: “Between these two—both Shahs and proud—
<lb/>The matter will prove wearisome for us.
<lb/>Hosts are upon their way from Rum and Chin,
<lb/>And they will cause much bloodshed in the land.”
<lb/>Then one of that assembly said: “Ye chiefs,
<lb/>Exalted and heroic warriors!
<lb/>'Tis needful that we go out to Kubad,
</p>
<pb n="200"/>
<p>
<lb/>Who, it may be, will not recall the past,
<lb/>And bring to him Jamasp, the ten years’ child,
<lb/>To turn the hailstones of his wrath to pearls;
<lb/>So haply we may swerve aside and ‘scape
<lb/>From pillaging, from bloodshed, and from war.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>All went to meet Kubad and said to him:
<lb/>“O Shah of royal race! if thou hast hurt
<lb/>Men’s hearts, and they have washed their hearts and eyes
<lb/>In petulance, now act as pleaseth thee
<lb/>Because the world-lord ruleth o’er the world.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They all drew near to him in haste, afoot,
<lb/>Dust-covered, and with gloomy souls. The Shah
<lb/>Forgave the evil doings of his lords,
<lb/>Accepting their excuse in lieu of bloodshed;
<lb/>He pardoned too Jamasp: the nobles blessed him.
<lb/>He came and sat upon the royal throne:
<lb/>Jamasp became his liege. Kubad bestowed
<lb/>The conduct of the realm upon Rizmihr,
<lb/>And gave him great advancement. By his means
<lb/>The kingship was well ordered, and the world
<lb/>Fulfilled with justice and prosperity.
<lb/>Thus matters fared until Kisra grew tall—
<lb/>A stripling bold and lusty. Then Kubad
<lb/>Entrusted to wise governors his son,
<lb/>That fresh and fruitful Bough. Kubad directed
<lb/>All matters in Iran and in Turan,
<lb/>And raised his crown of greatness to the sky.
<lb/>Thereafter he led forth his host to Rum,
<lb/>Which proved as ’twere a lump of wax to him:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1611"/>
<lb/>He made a thorn-brake of those fields and fells.
<lb/>Two cities asked for quarter at his hands,
<lb/>One Hinduyan, the other Fariyab.
<lb/>He taught the Zandavesta there, established
<lb/>The Faith, and instituted Fanes of Fire,
<lb/>His power, the feasts of New Year’s Day and Sade.
</p>
<pb n="201"/>
<p>
<lb/>He fixed his royal seat at Madain,
<lb/>And wrought much good and ill. He built a city
<lb/>Betwixt Ahwaz and Pars, and founded too
<lb/>A hospital. He called the city’s name
<lb/>Ardashir; the Arabs call it now Hulwan.
<lb/>They opened everywhere canals that flowed
<lb/>A-brim, and peace and rest on earth abode.

<head>§ 6
The Story of Kubad and Mazdak, and how Kubad
adopted the Faith of Mazdak</head>
<p>
<lb/>Then there arose a man by name Mazdak,
<lb/>Learned, eloquent, judicious, and commanding,
<lb/>Of noble birth, a trafficker in knowledge,
<lb/>And brave Kubad gave ear to him. This man
<lb/>Became the king of kings’ chief minister,
<lb/>The treasurer and the guardian of the treasure.
<lb/>Then famine visited the world through atone
<lb/>A famine that afflicted great and small;
<lb/>No sign of snow appeared upon the sky,
<lb/>And none saw snow or rainfall in Iran.
<lb/>At length the nobles of the world begged bread
<lb/>And water at the portal of Kubad.
<lb/>Mazdak returned them this reply: “The Shah
<lb/>Will manifest to you a way of hope,”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then came himself in haste before the king,
<lb/>And said to him: "O upright Shah! I fain
<lb/>Would question thee upon a point if thou
<lb/>Wilt condescend to answer."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Eloquent
<lb/>Kubad replied: "Say on and make my lustre
<lb/>Fresh in the world."
<lb/>"A man," Mazdak rejoined,
<lb/>"Is bitten by a snake; his life is passing;
</p>
<pb n="202"/>
<p>
<lb/>Another man hath got the antidote
<lb/>Whereof the bitten can obtain no share.
<lb/>What then should be the guerdon of the man
<lb/>That hath it? Money will not purchase it."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah replied: "He is a murderer,
<lb/>And should be slain to avenge the other’s blood
<lb/>Before my gate whenever the pursuer
<lb/>Shall take him."
<lb/>Hearing this Mazdak went forth
<lb/>To those petitioners and told them thus:—
<lb/>"I have discussed the matter with the Shah.
<lb/>Wait till the dawn, and I will show you how
<lb/>To right yourselves."
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1612"/>
<p>
<lb/>They went away, returning
<lb/>At dawn with stricken hearts in deep affliction.
<lb/>Mazdak, when he beheld those chiefs from far,
<lb/>Ran from the portal to the Shah and said:—
<lb/>"O thou victorious Shah and eloquent,
<lb/>Unsleeping, and the glory of the throne!
<lb/>Thou gavest me an answer, when I spake,
<lb/>And by that answer oped my bolted door,
<lb/>So now with thy permission I will speak
<lb/>A word to guide thee."
<lb/>"Speak," the Shah replied,
<lb/>"Lock not thy lips because thy words will help me."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Mazdak said: "Noble king! suppose a man,
<lb/>Whom thou hast bound, but they withhold from him
<lb/>All food until he dieth, thus perforce
<lb/>Surrendering sweet life. Now how should one
<lb/>Be punished who had bread yet left that captive
<lb/>In destitution? Will the great king say:—
<lb/>'This man was wise and holy?'"
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said the Shah:—
<lb/>"Rend such to pieces, for see his neglect
<lb/>He is a murderer."
</p>
<pb n="203"/>
<p>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Mazdak, when he had kissed the ground, went forth.
<lb/>And from the portal thus harangued the crowd:—
<lb/>"Go to the magazines where grain is stored,
<lb/>And help yourselves while if the owners ask
<lb/>Its value give them gold."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His own possessions
<lb/>Within that city he gave up to pillage
<lb/>In order that all folk might have their share.
<lb/>Then all the hungry rabble fared in haste
<lb/>To plunder every magazine of corn,
<lb/>Owned by the citizens or by Kubad,
<lb/>Who had none left to bless themselves withal.
<lb/>The officers, when they perceived this, went
<lb/>Before the watchful world-lord and thus said:—
<lb/>"The mob have sacked the Shah’s own granaries,
<lb/>But all the fault recoileth on Mazdak."
<lb/>Kubad bade call that man of eloquence,
<lb/>And talked with him about the pillaging.
<lb/>Mazdak replied: "Mayst thou be fortunate,
<lb/>And may thy words be wisdom’s daily food.
<lb/>I only told the wretched market-folk
<lb/>The words which I had heard the monarch speak.
<lb/>I asked the Shah about the snake and poison,
<lb/>And of the man who had the antidote.
<lb/>The Shah returned this answer to his servant
<lb/>Concerning him that had and him that sought it:—
<lb/>'If any die of snake-bite in the city,
<lb/>Unhelped by one who hath the remedy,
<lb/>For such they shall require that niggard’s blood.'
<lb/>The Shah’s authority must not be slighted.
<lb/>Bread is the antidote for hungry men—
<lb/>An antidote not wanted by the full.
<lb/>If thou art one that judgest right, O Shah!
<lb/>Shall not the corn in store be put to use?
<lb/>To hunger have a multitude succumbed,
<lb/>Whose deaths are due to idle granaries."
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1613"/>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad was much affected by the words:
<lb/>These righteous words aroused his brain to action.
<lb/>Then, questioning Mazdak and hearing him,
<lb/>The Shah perceived him learned in heart and brain
<lb/>In all things that the prophets, the archmages—
<lb/>Those righteous dealers—and the great had spoken.
<lb/>The teaching of Mazdak perverted him,
<lb/>And exercised unbounded influence.
<lb/>The multitude came thronging to Mazdak—
<lb/>The many that had wandered from the way:
<lb/>He said to them: "The man of empty hand
<lb/>Is equal to the man possessed of wealth.
<lb/>No one should have a superfluity,
<lb/>The wealthy is the warp, the poor the woof;
<lb/>To right the world all men must have sufficient;
<lb/>The rich man’s plenty is abominable;
<lb/>The women, goods, and houses are for all;
<lb/>The empty-handed and the rich are one.
<lb/>I will take order that the holy Faith
<lb/>Be manifest, the lofty from the low.
<lb/>Whoever is of other Faith than this,
<lb/>The malison of God is on that div."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He treated mendicants, both old and young,
<lb/>As though they were the equals of himself,
<lb/>He took from this man and bestowed on that;
<lb/>The archmages were astonished at his doings.
<lb/>Kubad himself gave ear and was converted,
<lb/>And of all things was joyful in his words.
<lb/>He set Mazdak at his right hand although
<lb/>An archimage unknown to all the host,
<lb/>And unto him the mendicants resorted
<lb/>With those that earned a living by their toil;
<lb/>His Faith began to flourish in the world,
<lb/>And no one dared to seek revenge on him,
<lb/>The rich renounced the things that made them glad,
<lb/>And gave to mendicants what wealth they had.
</p>

</div>
<div>
<pb n="205"/>
<head>§ 7
How Nushirwan rejected the Faith of Mazdak and slew
him and his Followers</head>
<p>
<lb/>It happened that Mazdak at dawn one day
<lb/>Went from his house and came before the Shah,
<lb/>And thus he said: “Of those that hold our Faith,
<lb/>As well as of our lieges pure of heart,
<lb/>A crowd of chiefs are at the door; shall I
<lb/>Admit them or shall they depart?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad,
<lb/>On hearing, bade the chamberlain admit them,
<lb/>Whereat Mazdak said to the noble Shah:—
<lb/>“This house is narrow and the crowd is great,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1614"/>
<lb/>In sooth the audience-hall will hold them not;
<lb/>Let the Shah go and see them on the plain.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad commanded that his throne be brought,
<lb/>Brought from the royal palace to the waste,
<lb/>And there a hundred thousand Mazdakis
<lb/>Proceeded joyfully before the Shah,
<lb/>And thus Mazdak addressed the king of earth:—
<lb/>“O thou above all knowledge and acclaim!
<lb/>Know that Kisra accepteth not our Faith,
<lb/>But is it fit that he should turn therefrom?
<lb/>We must obtain from him an undertaking
<lb/>In writing to give up his evil course.
<lb/>There are five things that turn men from the right,
<lb/>And e’en the sage can add no sixth. Now these
<lb/>Are anger, vengeance, jealousy, and need;
<lb/>The fifth is greed, which is predominant,
<lb/>And if thou conquer these five divs the way
<lb/>Of God will be made manifest to thee.
<lb/>From these five things it cometh that our women
<lb/>And wealth work havoc with the good religion,
<lb/>But will not meddle more if thou wilt keep it
</p>
<pb n="206"/>
<p>
<lb/>Intact. The twain cause jealousy, greed, need,
<lb/>While anger and revenge conspire with them,
<lb/>And thus the Div perverteth wise men’s heads:
<lb/>The twain should be a common property.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>This spoken, by the hand he grasped Kisra,
<lb/>What while the Shah looked on in wonderment.
<lb/>The noble prince in wrath withdrew his hand,
<lb/>And turned his eyes in anger from Mazdak,
<lb/>To whom Kubad said smiling: “Why art thou
<lb/>Concerned for the religion of Kisra?”
<lb/>Mazdak rejoined: “The way of righteousness
<lb/>Is not in him. He is not of our Faith.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah then questioned of Kisra and said:—
<lb/>“What way is there except the good religion?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kisra replied: “If I shall have the time
<lb/>Allowed me I will prove this theory false.
<lb/>When both the fraud and falsehood shall appear
<lb/>My truth will show out more conspicuously.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Mazdak rejoined: “Thou askest of the Shah—
<lb/>The lustre of the world—how many days?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: “I ask a period of five months.
<lb/>The Shah shall have his answer in the sixth
<lb/>On all points.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They agreed and so departed.
<lb/>The exalted Shah returned to his own palace.
<lb/>Kisra dispatched a man to every quarter
<lb/>To look for sages and auxiliaries.
<lb/>An envoy went to Khurra-i-Ardshir
<lb/>To cause the old Hurmuzd to come to court,
<lb/>While from Istakhr came Mihr-Azar of Pars
<lb/>With thirty friends. These seekers after knowledge
<lb/>Held session and discussed the case at large,
<lb/>And then these men of lore and ancient sages
<lb/>Presented their conclusions to Kisra,
</p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1615"/>
<p>
<lb/>While he, when he had heard, went to Kubad,
<lb/>Discoursed with him about Mazdak, and said:—
<pb n="207"/>
<lb/>"The time now hath arrived when I would make
<lb/>Investigation of the good religion.
<lb/>If then Mazdak be right, and if the Faith
<lb/>Delivered by Zarduhsht shall prove in fault,
<lb/>I will accept the true Faith of Mazdak,
<lb/>And make my soul’s choice his, for when the way
<lb/>Of Faridun, of Esdras, and of Christ,
<lb/>And all the Zandavasta, shall prove wrong,
<lb/>And when the doctrine of Mazdak shall stand,
<lb/>The world must take him for its only guide.
<lb/>If, on the other hand, his words are false,
<lb/>And he ensueth not God’s holy way,
<lb/>Then turn thee from the pathway of his Faith,
<lb/>Put far from thee this sorry Creed of his,
<lb/>And give him with his followers to me;
<lb/>God grant that none of them keep brain and skin."

<lb/>He took as witnesses Rizmihr, Kharrad,
<lb/>Bihzad, Bandwi, and Faré’in, and thence
<lb/>Departed to his palace and observed
<lb/>The righteous covenant that he had made.
<lb/>At dawn, what time the sun displayed its crown,
<lb/>And earth was like a sea of ivory,
<lb/>The world-king’s son, that man of eloquence,
<lb/>Set forth with chieftains and with archimages.
<lb/>They went together to the royal palace.
<lb/>Their speech was fluent and their quest the Way.
<lb/>That youth—the Joy of hearts—came to Kubad,
<lb/>And oped the case, whereon an archimage
<lb/>Addressed Mazdak before the throng and said:—
<lb/>"O seeker after wisdom! thou hast framed
<lb/>A new religion in the world and made
<lb/>Community of women and of goods.
<lb/>How will a father recognise his son,
<lb/>The son in like wise recognise his father?
<lb/>When every man is equal in the world,
</p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>
<lb/>And great and little are no more discerned,
<lb/>Who then will serve, and how can any rule?
<lb/>Who then will labour for us, thee and me,
<lb/>And how shall good men be discerned from bad?
<lb/>When one shall die to whom will appertain
<lb/>His house and goods when toiling slave and Shah
<lb/>Are equal? This will desolate the world;
<lb/>Such evil must not come upon Iran.
<lb/>When all are masters who will be the servant?
<lb/>When all have treasure who be treasurer?
<lb/>None of the leaders of the Faith spake thus,
<lb/>And thou art mad although thou hidest it.
<lb/>Thou leadest all mankind to Hell, and thou
<lb/>Accountest not all evil-doing wrong.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kubad, when he had heard the archmage’s words,
<lb/>Was wroth and then gave sentence on the case.
<lb/>The illustrious Kisra supported him,
<lb/>The impious one grew full of fear at heart,
<lb/>While all the people there assembled cried:—
<lb/>"Let not Mazdak remain before the Shah;
<lb/>He hath made havoc of the Faith of God;
<lb/>Let him not tarry at this famous court.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah became abhorrent from that Faith,
<lb/>The heads of all its chiefs grew full of care.
<lb/>He gave up to Kisra Mazdak forthwith
<lb/>With all that held that doctrine and that way—
<lb/>As many as three thousand men of name.
<lb/>The king at that time thus addressed his son:—
<lb/>“Do with those chiefs as seemeth good to thee,
<lb/>And henceforth mention not Mazdak.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Kisra
<lb/>Had at his court a pleasure-ground whose wall
<lb/>Was higher than a crow could fly. Around
<lb/>The circuit of that wall he dug a trench
<lb/>Wherein he set those men at intervals.
</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>
<lb/>They planted them like trees and firmly fixed
<lb/>Their feet aloft, their heads below. Kisra
<lb/>Addressed Mazdak on this wise: “Visit thou
<lb/>The entrance of my noble garth. The seed
<lb/>That thou hast scattered all this while hath brought
<lb/>Fruit forth to thee, O thou insensate one!
<lb/>Thou shalt see trees such as none e’er beheld,
<lb/>Or heard described by shrewd men heretofore.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Mazdak went, oped the portal of the garden,
<lb/>And thought maybe to see fruit-bearing trees,
<lb/>But seeing what he did he gave a cry,
<lb/>And then all consciousness abandoned him.
<lb/>Kisra gave orders for a lofty gibbet
<lb/>To be set up and at the top to fasten
<lb/>A twisted lasso. Thereupon he hung
<lb/>That impious wretch head-downwards and alive,
<lb/>And after slew him with a shower of arrows.
<lb/>If thou art prudent follow not Mazdak!
<lb/>The chiefs felt reassured about their wealth,
<lb/>Their women, children, and their pleasances.
<lb/>Kubad remained ashamed for many days,
<lb/>And cursed Mazdak, gave mendicants much largess,
<lb/>And offered gifts before the Fane of Fire.
<lb/>He gladdened at Kisra exceedingly
<lb/>Because that Bough of his bore fruit of gems.
<lb/>From that time forth the father sought alway
<lb/>The son’s advice and heard what he would say.

<p>
<lb/>Now when Kubad had reigned for forty years
<lb/>The grief of death’s day came upon his heart.
</p>
<pb n="210"/>
<p>
<lb/>He had a writing fairly drawn on silk
<lb/>In that befitting and engaging script, <note>Pahlavi.</note>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1617"/>
<lb/>And first he offered praise to that just Judge,
<lb/>‘Who gave us Faith, accomplishment, and wisdom,
<lb/>Whose word is certain, whatsoe’er He saith,
<lb/>Alike in secret things and manifest.
<lb/>None hath beheld His height of sovereignty,
<lb/>And His elect ne’er are contemptible.
<lb/>All ye that see the writing of Kubad!
<lb/>Give heed but to the counsel of the wise.
<lb/>I have bestowed the honourable throne
<lb/>Upon Kisra. Fair fortune will be his
<lb/>When I am dead. May God accept my son,
<lb/>And may his foes’ hearts be fulfilled with smoke.
<lb/>By this our signet-ring we do require
<lb/>Of archimages, chiefs, and other subjects
<lb/>That ye in no wise shall transgress his bidding,
<lb/>But joy in him and fill your treasuries.”
<lb/>He set his golden signet on that writing,
<lb/>And placed it with the archmage Ram Barzin.
<lb/>Kubad had come to four-score years and yet,

<head>XLI. NUSHIRWAN: HE REIGNED FORTY-EIGHT YEARS</head>

<div><head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>
The poet tells of the accession of Nushirwan, his internal
administration, his repression of marauding tribes, his first war
with Rum, the revolt and death of his son Nushzad, of the rise
to power and wisdom of Buzurjmihr, the fall of Mahbud, the
Shah’s marriage with the daughter of the Khan, Buzurjmihr’s
discourse on good words and deeds, the introduction into Persia
of the game of chess and the Fables of Bidpai, the legend of the
invention of the former and that of the game of nard, the fall and
the restoration to favor of Buzurjmihr, the wisdom of Nushirwan,
his last war with Rum, his appointment of his successor, and death.

<head>NOTE</head>
<p>
Kisra, surnamed Nushirwan (Chosroes I, A.D. 531-578), ruled
contemporaneously with three Eastern Roman Emperors—Justinian
(A.D. 527-565), Justin II (A.D. 565-574), and Tiberius II (A.D.
574-582). Justin resigned the rule to Tiberius, the captain of the
guards, in A.D. 574, but did not die till A.D. 578, the year of
Nushirwan’s death. Nushirwan was perhaps the greatest of the
twenty-nine Sasanian Shahs, at least it is not easy to assign that
title to any other unless we reserve it for the founder of the
dynasty, Ardshir Papakan, who has to his credit the overthrow of
a long-standing foreign domination, the re-establishment of a
national dynasty, and all the toil of political reconstruction that
his successful revolt against the last Arsacid involved.
It will be seen that the poet had plenty of material for this
portion of his undertaking. The subject-matter falls naturally
into certain well-defined divisions; accordingly we have broken
</p>
<pb n="213"/>
<p>
up the reign, as in the case of that of Gushtasp, <note n="1">Vol. v. p. 9.</note> into Parts, but
there is no such arrangement in the original.
Kisra will be referred to throughout by his popular title of
Nushirwan.
</p>
<p>
The principal historical events recorded by Firdausi in his
account of the reign may be placed in approximate chronological
order as follows:—
<list>
<item>The fall of Mahbud.</item>
<item>The reorganisation of the kingdom, finances, and army.</item>
<item>The chastisement of barbarous frontier-tribes,</item>
<item>The fortification of Darband.</item>
<item>The first war with Rum (A.D. 540-562).</item>
<item>The revolt of Nushzad (A.D. 551).</item>
<item>Nushirwan’s marriage with the daughter of the Khan.</item>
<item>The introduction into Persia of the Fables of Bidpai (about A.D. 570).</item>

<div><head>PART I: NUSHIRWAN’S ADMINISTRATION OF THE REALM,
HIS WARS WITH FRONTIER-TRIBES AND WITH
RUM, AND THE REVOLT OF NUSHZAD</head>
<div>
<pb n="214"/>


<head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Nushirwan ascends the throne and makes an oration to the people.
He divides the realm into four provinces, and takes order for all
matter civil and military. He builds a wall in the Caucasus and
represses the Aldns and the men of Baliich and Gilin. He espouses
the cause of Munzir, the Arab, against Caesar, invades Rum, takes
cities, and compels Caesar to sue for peace and to pay tribute. On
a false report of the Shah’s death his son, Nushzad, a Christian,
attempts to seize the crown. Nushirwan writes to his general, Ram
Barzin, instructing him how to proceed, and Nushzad is defeated
and slain.</p>
<head>NOTE</head>
<p>§ 2. Nushirwan’s accession to the throne was not universally
popular and gave rise to a formidable conspiracy in favour of one
of his nephews.<note n="1">See p. 316. </note></p>

<p>§ 3. Nushirwan’s division of his empire into four satrapies differs
in details in the different authorities, but seems to have been
suggested by the names of the four winds. According to Dinawari
the East included Khurdsan, Sistan, and Kirdan; the North
Ispahan, Kum, Media Magna, and Azarbaijan; the South Pars and
Ahwaz; the West Iraq to the Roman frontier.<note n="2">NT, p. 155, note. </note>
Firdausi includes the Khazars in the South division—a mistake. They lived
beyond the Caucasus.<note n="3">See Vol. iv. p. 316.</note>
He includes too Rum in the West division
on the assumption, for which there was certainly some justification
at this time, that Rum was tributary to Iran. A peace or truce
concluded between Justinian and Nushirwan involved almost as
a matter of course a money-payment from the former to the latter.
It did not follow that Justinian always got the worst of the bargain.
For instance, in the definite treaty of peace between the two</p>

<pb n="215"/>

<p>empires in A.D. 562, Nushirwan’s renunciation of Lazica (Mingrelia
and Imeritia), and consequently of his dream of a fleet and of assail-
ing Rum by sea, was well worth the thirty thousand pieces of gold
to be paid annually by Justinian though it did lay the Emperor
open to the imputation of being tributary to the Shah. Traditional
instances of such payments crop up in the Shahnama as far back
as the days of Darab and Failakus.<note n="1">See vol. vi. p. 24. </note></p>

<p>The popular version of the origin of Kubid’s resolve to alter the
system of taxation has been given already.<note n="2">p. 183, notes aah</note>
It was left to
Nushirwan to carry it out. According to Tabari the taxes imposed
were as follows:—On every garib of corn-land, i.e., sown with
wheat or barley, a ground-tax of one drachm was imposed, on
every garib of vineyard eight, and of lucerne seven; on four
Persian date-palms, six common date-palms, provided that they
grew in plantations or in numbers, and on six olives, one drachm.
Single, scattered trees were not taxed. On all men between the
ages of twenty and fifty a poll-tax varying, according to the
fortune of a man, was imposed. The people were arranged in classes
and paid twelve, eight, six, or four drachms according to their means.
The taxes were paid yearly in three instalments at intervals of
four months. Schedules of the taxes were drawn up, one of which
was kept at the royal chancery, one sent to each collector, and one
to each district-judge. The judges were priests and were charged
particularly with the duty of seeing that the collectors did not
exceed the tariff, and also, in cases where the crops had been
damaged, with the duty of remitting taxation to a proportionate
amount. The nobility, soldiers, priests, scribes, and others in the
royal service, were exempt from the poll-tax.<note n="3">NT, p. 244. A garib is said to have been equal to 3600 square ells and a drachm to 88 centimes. Id. pp. 242, 245, notes.</note>
They were supposed to render their due to the State in other ways.</p>

<p>§6. Faridin had his capital in Madzandaran. See Vol. i. pp.
177, 230. For the vegetation of that region, which is very luxu-
riant, see Vol, ii, pp. 27, 31.</p>
<p>
For the fortifications at Darband, see p. 187 and Vol. i. p. 16.
Mas’udi’s two accounts of Nushirwan’s wall, as given in the
French translation, are as follows:—“Appelé dans le pays d’El-
Bab et dans le Caucase par les incursions des rois du voisinage, il
bâtit sur la mer (Caspienne), à l’aide d’outres de cuir gonflées, une
muraille de rochers, qu’il consolida avec le fer et le plomb. Ces
outres s’enfonçaient dans l’eau, à mesure que la construction
s'élevait; lorsqu’elles s’arrêtèrent sur le fond et que la muraille

<pb n="216"/>

dépassa le niveau de l’eau, des plongeurs, armés de poignards et
de coutelas, crevèrent les outres; la muraille, entrant profondément
dans le sol sous-marin, atteignit alors la hauteur du rivage. Elle
existe encore aujourd’hui, en 332,<note n="1">A.D. 943. </note>
et toute la partie de cette
muraille dont les assises plongent dans la mer est nommée el-kaid
(la chaîne), parce qu’elle arrête les bâtiments ennemis qui ten-
teraient d’aborder sur cette côte. On continua le même travail
le long du rivage, entre le Caucase et la mer; on pratiqua des
portes donnant sur le territoire infidèle, et l’on prolongea la
muraille sur le mont Caucase, ainsi que nous l’avons dit ci-dessus,
en décrivant cette montagne et la ville d’El-Bab.”<note n="2">MM, ii. 196.</note>
</p>
<p>
The other account referred to is this:—“Le Kabkh est une
grande chaîne de montagnes qui renferme, dans sa vaste étendue,
‘un nombre considérable de royaumes et de tribus: en effet, on
n'y compte pas moins de soixante-douze peuplades, qui ont
chacune leur chef et parlent une langue qui leur est propre. Ces
montagnes sont sillonnées de gorges et de vallées; c’est à la tête
de l’un de ces défilés que se trouve la ville de Bab-el-Abwab, bâtie
par Kosroes Anushirwan, sur un point intermédiaire entre le pays
montueux et la mer des Khazars. Le même souverain construisit
cette célèbre muraille qui, d’une part, s'avance dans la mer, jusqu’à
une distance d’environ un mille des côtes, et, d’autre part, s’élève
sur les sommets abrupts des montagnes et descend dans leurs
gorges profondes, sur une longueur de quarante parasanges, jusqu’à
ce qu’elle aboutisse à une place forte nommée Tabarestan. De
trois milles en trois milles à peu près, suivant l'importance de la
route sur laquelle elle s’ouvrait, il plaça une porte de fer, près
de laquelle il installa, dans l'intérieur de l'enceinte, une peuplade
chargée de veiller à sa garde et à celle de la muraille. Ce rempart
devait opposer une barrière infranchissable aux attaques des tribus
voisines du Kabkh, telles que les Khazars, les Alains, les Turcs, les
Serirs et les autres peuplades infidèles.”<note n="3">Id., p. 1. </note>
</p>

<p>
One of the terms of peace made between Nushirwan and
Justinian, after the death of Kubad, was that Persia should be
paid the sum of eleven thousand pounds of gold towards the
maintenance of the defences in the Caucasus and should undertake
the actual defence herself.<note n="4">RSM, p. 382.</note>
</p>

<p>
For Sikandar’s wall, built, according to the legend, with a similar
purpose, see Vol. vi. p. 163.
</p>

<p>§7. Nushirwan’s dealings with the Alans and the folk of Gilan
<pb n="217"/>

are historical, but Firdausi substitutes the Baluchis, who made
themselves very troublesome in his time, for another tribe,
mentioned in his authorities but unknown to him, which dwelt
north of the Caucasus<note n="1">NT, p. 157, note. </note>
It is very unlikely that any of the
Sasanian Shahs ever got as far East as Hindustan.
</p>

<p>
§§ 8-10. The accession of Nushirwan found Persia and the
Eastern Roman Empire at war, but a year or two later he concluded
what was known as the “the endless peace” with Justinian. The
title was somewhat unfortunate, as in A.D. 540 war again broke out
owing, according to Firdausi and Tabari, to the treatment of
Munzir, prince of Hira (A.D. 505-554), by the Romans. He was
Nushirwan’s protégé and had a dispute with Harith bin Jabala,
the Ghassanian and Justinian’s protégé, about a pasturage for
sheep south of Palmyra. Harith, as Tabari states, attacked Munzir,
made a great slaughter of his people, and carried off much booty.
Munzir appealed to Nushirwan, who could get no accommodation
from Justinian, and war ensued between the two empires.<note n="2">Id. p. 238; BLRE, i. 418.</note></p>

<p>Historically of course there were other reasons, one of the chief
being that Justinian, secured on his Persian frontier by the
“endless peace,” had availed himself of the opportunity and the
services of Belisarius to extend and almost double his possessions
by conquests in the West. “Both his friends and his enemies said,
with hate or admiration, ‘The whole earth cannot contain him;
he is already scrutinising the ether and the retreats beyond the
ocean, if he may win some new world.’”<note n="3">Id. </note>
Justinian’s success
threatened to upset the balance of power. Probably, too, there were
always “pin-pricks” going on between the two empires.</p>

<p>§11. The Fire-temple visited by Nushirwan before beginning his
campaign was probably not one at Tabriz but the more famous one
at what is now Takht-i-Sulaiman, about one hundred miles to the
South. It was to this latter that the Sasanian Shahs were wont to
resort at important epochs in their lives.<note n="4">Cf. pp. 5, 86, 94.</note>
</p>

<p>It will be noticed that a Mihran commands the centre of
Nushirwan’s host—another instance of the prominent part played
by this family of Arsacid descent in Sasanian times. Cf. p. 185.</p>

<p>§12. Crossing the Euphrates Nushirwan marched along its
western bank till he reached Sura, the Greek τα Ζωτικά and the
Shurab of Firdausi, which was taken without difficulty, sacked, and
burnt. The Shah then advanced to Hierapolis, the Ardyish-i-Rum
of the Shahnama, which was allowed to ransom itself for two

<pb n="218"/>

thousand pounds of silver.<note n="1">RSM, p. 387. </note>
Hierapolis sounds somewhat like
Ardyish, which means “ornament,” so it would seem that the
poet converted the name of that city into Ardyish-i-Rum or
“Ornament of Rum.”</p>

<p>§13. On leaving this city Nushirwan, according to Firdausi,
encountered and defeated a Roman army led by Farfuriyus.
Historically, the Persians in their advance on Antioch, in the course
of which they held Chalybon-Beroea (Aleppo) to ransom, appear to
have been unopposed. The occupation of Callinicus (Callinicus)
did not take place till the third campaign (A.D. 543) when the city
made no resistance, and the inhabitants were led away captive.
It was situated on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. In A.D. 531,
however, Belisarius, after foiling an attempt of a combined force of
Persians and Arabs to raid Antioch, was worsted in a battle at
Callinicus; so the two campaigns may have become confused in
tradition. Germanus, Justinian’s nephew, had been at Antioch
before the Persians reached and stormed it in A.D. 540, but had
withdrawn as he considered the existing fortifications could not
be held with success. The taking of Antakiya (Antioch) was
Nushirwan’s crowning achievement in this his first campaign
against Rum, and he returned home by another route, compelling
various cities to ransom themselves on his way. Farfuriyus is
probably Firdausi’s rendering of a Byzantine title. Belisarius took
no part in the campaign of A.D. 540; he only returned from Italy
in that year.</p>

encountered and defeated a Roman army led by Farfuriyus.
Historically, the Persians in their advance on Antioch, in the course
of which they held Chalybon-Beroea (Aleppo) to ransom, appear to
have been unopposed. The occupation of Callinicus (Callinicus)
did not take place till the third campaign (A.D. 543) when the city
made no resistance, and the inhabitants were led away captive.
It was situated on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. In A.D. 531,
however, Belisarius, after foiling an attempt of a combined force of
Persians and Arabs to raid Antioch, was worsted in a battle at
Callinicus; so the two campaigns may have become confused in
tradition. Germanus, Justinian’s nephew, had been at Antioch
before the Persians reached and stormed it in A.D. 540, but had
withdrawn as he considered the existing fortifications could not
be held with success. The taking of Antakiya (Antioch) was
Nushirwan’s crowning achievement in this his first campaign
against Rum, and he returned home by another route, compelling
various cities to ransom themselves on his way. Farfuriyus is
probably Firdausi’s rendering of a Byzantine title. Belisarius took
no part in the campaign of A.D. 540; he only returned from Italy
in that year.</p>

<p>§14. That Nushirwan built a new Antioch on the Tigris, not far
from Ctesiphon, as a residence for his Roman captives is no doubt
historical, though we need not commit ourselves to Tabari’s state-
ment that the new town was so exactly a reproduction of the
original that the captives, on arriving, went to their own houses as
naturally as if they had never left home.<note n="2">NT, p. 165.</note>
The cordwainer from
Callinicus would be a later arrival.<note n="3">See above. </note>
The new Antioch was also
known as Rumiya or “The Roman” and by other names.</p>

<p>§15. Negotiations for peace had been going on even during the
first year of the war, though they came to nothing, but five years later
a suspension of hostilities was agreed upon for five years. Justinian
had to give Nushirwan two thousand pounds of gold.<note n="4">RSM, pp. 391 seq., 404.</note>
Firdausi
does not carry the story of the war further. Peace was made, after
the resumption of the war which was followed by another five
years’ truce, definitively in A.D. 562.</p>

<pb n="219"/>

<p>§§ 16-19. The revolt of Nushzad, "Immortal-born,” is historical,
and the circumstances attending it may be stated fairly correctly
perhaps as follows. He seems to have been Nushirwan’s eldest son,
and to have been brought up as a Christian by his mother, who was
in that Shah’s seraglio and of course a Christian herself. On
account of his religion, or for some other reason, he was interned
by his father at Gund-i-Shapur,<note n="1">See Vol. vi. p. 295. </note> which contained a strong Christian
element and was the seat of the Nestorian Metropolitan—the next
in rank to the Patriarch.<note n="2">NT, p. 41.</note> When the news, false as it turned out,
of his father’s death reached him he had every reason to bestir him-
self. In the circumstances there was a likelihood of his being
passed over in the matter of the succession. His father’s known
disapproval, the rivalry of his brothers, and his own religion, were
obstacles which had to be faced promptly if at all, while as the
eldest-born it was only natural that he should aspire to the vacant
throne. At the time when his rising occurred (A.D. 551) there was
a five years’ truce in force between Persia and the Eastern Roman
Empire, so it is not likely that he got much help from that quarter.
Probably Justinian never heard of the affair till it was all over.
The Christian inhabitants of Gund-i-Shapur naturally would
support Nushzad, and it is interesting to find that the leader of his
troops is Shammis—a word meaning a Christian priest or deacon.
The general Persian opinion of Christians is shown by the word
“tarsa,” which means a Christian because its primary meaning is
“cowardly,” but it does not appear that Firdausi shared that view;
on the contrary, when obviously putting his own words into the
mouths of his characters, he treats the Church militant, especially
the episcopacy, with much respect.<note n="3">E.g., Vol. i. p. 378. Cf., too, the parable of the kerchiefs where Christianity is meant by the “Faith of Yitindan,’’ which is described as being “good.” Vol. vi. p. 95.</note> It is very unlikely therefore
that the derogatory words concerning Christianity in the utterances
of Nushirwan and Piruz were the poet’s own. Neither are they
characteristically Muhammadan. Firdausi found them in his
authorities translated from the Pahlavi. Historically, Nushzad does
not appear to have fallen in the fight: he fell into his father’s
hands, was blinded probably, imprisoned, and disappeared from his-
tory. The concluding scene of the story may be regarded therefore
as the poet’s own contribution to it. There is nothing polemical
there, but all is characterised by dignity and good feeling.<note n="4">For Nushzad generally see NT, p. 467.</note></p>

The Prelude</head>
<p>
<lb/><q>O lofty Cypress, thou that ravishest
<lb/>The heart! Oh! wherefore art thou thus opprest?
<lb/>With pleasure, Grace, and luxury anear
<lb/>Why is thine ardent heart fulfilled with fear?</q>
<lb/>Said to the questioner the Cypress-tree:
<lb/><q>'T was in Joy ere age o’ermastered me.
<lb/>I yield me to the puissance of three-score,
<lb/>Forbear then and contend therewith no more,
<lb/>For it hath dragon’s breath and lion’s claw,
<lb/>And whomsoe’er it flingeth it will gnaw.
<lb/>It hath the might of wolf, and thunder-breath,
<lb/>In one hand care and in the other death.
<lb/>It maketh stoop the Cypress that subdued
<lb/>All hearts, it maketh jasmine amber-hued;
<lb/>It giveth saffron’s tint to cercis-bloom,
<lb/>And, after saffron’s tint, a toilful doom.
<lb/>The runner’s foot is bound though fetterless,
<lb/>The precious body turned to wretchedness;
<lb/>The lustrous pearls begin to fail with me,
<lb/>And stoopeth too the noble cypress-tree;
<lb/>My melancholy eyes bewail and run
<lb/>Through their debility and travail done;
<lb/>My blithe, glad heart is full of pain, and thus
<lb/>These days of mine have grown ungenerous.
<lb/>Or ever man is weaned his death is nigh,
<lb/>And people call him old! The sovereignty
<lb/>Of Nushirwan was forty years and eight;
<lb/>To look for youth at sixty is too late
<lb/>For thee, so seek an end to thine affairs,
<lb/>And wound thy heart no more by gainful cares.</q><note n="1">There is no break here in the original.</note>

<head>§ 2
How Nushirwan ascended the Throne and made an Oration
to the Iranians</head>
<p>
<lb/>When Nushirwan<note n="1">Kisra in the original, but henceforth we write Nushirwan.</note>
assumed the ivory throne,
<lb/>And donned the crown—the lustre of the heart—
<lb/>The great men of the world were gathered there
<lb/>What time the Shah sat with his counsellors.
<lb/>That chief of famous men then loosed his tongue,
<lb/>Invoked the righteous Giver of all good,
<lb/>And said: <q>Be our hearts filled with praise and love
<lb/>'Toward the almighty Ruler of the sky,
<lb/>From whom are good and ill, fame and desire,
<lb/>By whom I am made sorrowful and glad,
<lb/>Of whom are Grace and strength. By His command
<lb/>The sun is bright in heaven. We will not quit
<lb/>His counsels and His covenant, or reckon
<lb/>Our breaths but at His bidding. He that doth
<lb/>That which is Just upon the throne of power
<lb/>Will have fruition of good fortune here;
<lb/>But he that harboureth an ill intent
<lb/>Will bring disaster on himself at last.
<lb/>Whate’er ye ask of us we will reply,
<lb/>And in our answer will advise you well.
<lb/>None wotteth of the secrets of the heart;
<lb/>That is a way too strait for me to find;
<lb/>But still if justice be the Shah’s employ
<lb/>It surely will rejoice the hearts of all.
<lb/>Delay not till the morrow this day’s work;
<lb/>How know’st thou what to-morrow will bring forth?
<lb/>The rose in bloom to-day will have
<lb/>But worthless flowers for thee to cull to-morrow.
<lb/>In days when thou art hale be not unmindful
<lb/>Of malady, of suffering, and of loss;</q>
<pb n="222"/>

<lb/><q>Think of the day of death which closeth life,
<lb/>And how with death we are as leaves with wind.
<lb/>When thou art slack to act thou makest all
<lb/>Thy policy unsound. When envy swayeth
<lb/>The heart of man no leech can cure that ache.
<lb/>When passion mastereth wisdom is't not proof
<lb/>Of madness? Furthermore, none honoureth
<lb/>The quarrelsome and talkative. The path
<lb/>That leadeth thee to guile is gloomier,
<lb/>To right is straiter. Skilful as thou art,
<lb/>If thou art lazy and perfunctory
<lb/>Thy work will turn out ill. Whene’er the tongue
<lb/>Is wedded to deceit it hath no lustre
<lb/>From heavenly fortune. Feckless folk resort
<lb/>To lying, and we can but weep for such.
<lb/>Whenas the Shah is first to rise from slumber
<lb/>He will be safe from foes and hale of body.
<lb/>Be wise and have withal enough to eat,
<lb/>But more than this is anguish, toil, and greed.
<lb/>Whenas a Shah is just and liberal
<lb/>The world is full of goodness and of peace,
<lb/>But if he thwarteth justice in its course
<lb/>He eateth colocynth and drinketh blood.
<lb/>All ye in this assembly! Hear what
<lb/>I proclaim to you, learn it, observe it well,
<lb/>And all your years fare side by side with fortune:
<lb/>Full many a crowned monarch have we scanned,
<lb/>And our choice is the path of right and wisdom;
<lb/>Yet must ye listen to my minister,
<lb/>For good and ill appear not save through him.<note n="1">Reading with P,</note>

<lb/>Whoever cometh to this court of mine
<lb/>With just cause whether in or out of season,
<lb/>No minister of mine will I approve
<lb/>That keepeth such a matter hid from me.
<lb/>As for the officers about my court,
<pb n="223"/>

<lb/>And valiant cavaliers among my troops,
<lb/>As we stint not the stipend due to them
<lb/>So must they tender mine own name and fame.
<lb/>Let all be done humanely and uprightly
<lb/>Without defect of justice. Every one,
<lb/>That, being an Iranian, girdeth him
<lb/>To do his service in this court of ours,
<lb/>Shall have both treasure and kind words from us
<lb/>If he shall prove a shrewd and modest servant;
<lb/>But if his underlings shall be oppressed,
<lb/>And he shall be unwise and fear not God,
<lb/>He shall be punished for his wickedness,
<lb/>And we should grieve not o’er the fall of one
<lb/>So despicable. Keep within your hearts
<lb/>The laws of holy God and fear not us,
<lb/>For He is King of kings, Lord of the world,
<lb/>Victorious, and One whose word is law,
<lb/>The Illuminer of crown and sun and moon,
<lb/>Who showeth us the way of righteousness.
<lb/>Lord of the world is He, the Judge of judges,
<lb/>And higher than the thoughts of every man.
<lb/>He hath created heaven, space, and time,
<lb/>And hath adorned our souls and hearts with love.
<lb/>He is the Guard of crown and lofty throne,
<lb/>And when thou seekest help will succour thee.
<lb/>'Tis He hath fired your hearts with love of us,
<lb/>His will hath blinded, heart and eye, our foes.
<lb/>Well-being is all subject to His hest,
<lb/>All goodness underneath His providence.
<lb/>All from the stubble to the seventh heaven—
<lb/>Air, fire, and water, and our gloomy earth—
<lb/>Bear witness to His being and afford
<lb/>Thereof a clear assurance to thy soul.
<lb/>Whate’er we praise is under His command,
<lb/>And all our worship dedicate to Him.</q>
<pb n="224"/>

<lb/>When Nushirwan had spoken all the world
<lb/>Was lost in wonder at him. To their feet
<lb/>All rose with praise anew the Shah to greet.

<div>
<head>§ 3
How Nushirwan divided his Realm into four Parts and wrote
a Decree to his Officers on the Administration of Justice</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king of kings called unto him the wise,
<lb/>And settled the affairs of all the world.
<lb/>The world itself he parted into four,
<lb/>Assigning that which was inhabited.
<lb/>He first of all for Khurdsan took thought,
<lb/>And filled thereby the nobles’ hearts with joy.
<lb/>The second part was Kum and Ispahan—
<lb/>The seat of magnates and the place of chiefs—
<lb/>Wherewith Azarabadagan, whereon
<lb/>The Iranians lavished offerings, was comprised.
<lb/>That Shah of wary heart<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>included too
<lb/>Armenia up to Ardabil and Gil.
<lb/>The third from east to west was formed of Pars,
<lb/>Ahwaz, and of the marches of Khazar.
<lb/>Irak together with the land of Rum
<lb/>Came fourth—a splendid realm and populous—
<lb/>And in these marches to the indigent,
<lb/>Who had to toil to satisfy their needs,
<lb/>The Shah made largess of his hoarded treasures,
<lb/>And all folk blessed him.
<lb/>Now of former Shahs—
<lb/>Shahs greater or inferior to himself—
<lb/>All had required a portion of the crops,
<lb/>And no man thitherto had 'scaped the tax.
<lb/>The royal portion was a third or fourth
<pb n="225"/>

<lb/>Until Kavad came and required a tenth.
<lb/>He meant to have reduced it further still,
<lb/>And strove to make the lowly like the lord,
<lb/>But fortune gave him not the time.<note n="1">Cf. p. 183, note.</note>
<lb/>Whilst thou
<lb/>Art in the stream ne’er trust the crocodile.
<lb/>The crown of worship came to Nushirwan,
<lb/>And he remitted all the tenth forthwith.
<lb/>The sages, chiefs, great men, and archimages,
<lb/>The shrewd of heart, assembled—all the rulers.
<lb/>They had the land partitioned and surveyed,
<lb/>And laid thereon a land-tax of one drachm
<lb/>So that the owners might not be distressed.
<lb/>All that lacked seed or beast, when they should be
<lb/>Preparing for the crops, were subsidised
<lb/>Out of the treasure of the king of kings
<lb/>So that they might not let the ground lie fallow.
<lb/>Land, if untilled, was left out of account;
<lb/>The previous usages were done away.
<lb/>On each six fruiting vines a drachm was levied,
<lb/>Date-palm plantations paid an equal tax,
<lb/>While each ten stems of olives and of walnuts,
<lb/>And other trees that bear their fruit in autumn,
<lb/>Brought one drachm to the treasury, and this
<lb/>Was made the only burden of the year.
<lb/>To fruits that ripened in the month Khurdad
<lb/>No heed was paid in taxing. From the men
<lb/>Of means who neither owned nor tilled the soil
<lb/>The tax-collector every year received
<lb/>A payment varying from ten drachms to four;
<lb/>But no one was oppressed because the money
<lb/>Was paid in three instalments annually,
<lb/>And thus a third part of the tax was paid
<lb/>Each four months to the exchequer of the Shah.
<lb/>The royal scribes and officers employed
<lb/>Within the taxing-office passed all count.

<pb n="226"/>

<lb/>The Shah had these above-named tolls and imposts
<lb/>Recorded by the archmages in three ledgers,
<lb/>Whereof he gave one to the treasurer,
<lb/>And made that minister account for it;
<lb/>The second was for sending through the realm
<lb/>To all officials and the men in power;
<lb/>The third was handed to the archimages
<lb/>To keep account of all the revenue.
<lb/>All that concerned tax, toll, and husbandry
<lb/>Was done by order of the Shah himself,
<lb/>And he had agents scattered everywhere
<lb/>To keep him cognisant of good and ill.
<lb/>He filled with justice all the face of earth,
<lb/>And cultivated all the barren lands;
<lb/>Both great and small slept safely on the waste,
<lb/>And sheep and wolf came to one trough. He bade
<lb/>To draw up in the olden tongue a letter—
<lb/>One that will pleasure thee to hear from me.
<lb/>It thus began: <q>From Nushirwan, the chief—
<lb/>The king of kings, the worshipper of God,
<lb/>A Bough fruit-bearing from the Tree Kavad—
<lb/>Who hath assumed the crown of majesty,
<lb/>And in especial prospered all the land,
<lb/>For God, the just Judge, gave him Grace divine,
<lb/>To all the officers of revenue—
<lb/>Thralls of the shadow of our Grace and throne—
<lb/>Our well-weighed greetings unto you whose birth
<lb/>Hath been exceeded by your own deserts.
<lb/>Here at the outset of our task we first
<lb/>Give praises to the Maker of the world.
<lb/>Know that the man is wise and shrewd of heart,
<lb/>Whose praise is of the righteous Judge of earth,
<lb/>Well knowing that He hath no need of us,
<lb/>And that all secrets are revealed to Him,
<lb/>Who when He willeth to exalt a man
<lb/>First maketh him superior to all want.</q>
<pb n="227"/>
<lb/>He bade me judge, but He is Judge Himself,
<lb/>And higher than all height eternally.
<lb/>In God’s sight king and subject are as one,
<lb/>And saving service none hath aught to do;
<lb/>From the abyss of earth to heaven above,
<lb/>And from the sun to dark and sorry dust,
<lb/>The ant’s foot beareth witness that He is,
<lb/>That we are bondslaves and that He is king.
<lb/>All His commands to us are righteousness;
<lb/>It is the Div that causeth lies and loss.
<lb/>Now if my portion of the spacious world
<lb/>Had been a garden only, park, and palace,
<lb/>My heart had chosen naught but love and justice,
<lb/>And kept a smiling face for everything;
<lb/>But now the expanse of all the world throughout
<lb/>From east to west hath God, the Holy One,
<lb/>Bestowed upon me as my sovereignty—
<lb/>All from the bright sun to the darksome dust
<lb/>And I must practise naught save love and justice
<lb/>Although I furrow mine own face thereby.
<lb/>If careless be the shepherd and the waste
<lb/>Thus vast the sheep will 'scape not from the wolf.
<lb/>As for my subjects, whether country-folk
<lb/>Or those devoted to the Cult of Fire,
<lb/>Be they in drouthy dust or ship at sea
<lb/>By day or night alike, or be they merchants,
<lb/>Engaged in voyaging over wet and dry
<lb/>With monies and with lustrous pearls and musk,
<lb/>The sun must shine not from the arch of heaven
<lb/>Upon them save in justice and in love.
<lb/>Now this hath been the custom of our race
<lb/>That son should have his father’s crown and this
<lb/>The world hath recognised as just and right
<lb/>With one consent in public and in private.
<lb/>We have imposed a land-tax and a tree-tax
<lb/>For sustentation of the throne and crown.

<pb n="228"/>

<lb/>Now when they bring this letter to you may
<lb/>Ahura Mazda prove fortunate to you. Whoever
<lb/>Herein transgresseth by a single drachm,
<lb/>Or doth injustice for a single breath,
<lb/>I swear by God, who hath bestowed upon me
<lb/>The diadem of Grace, that I will saw
<lb/>That man in twain; such is God’s chastisement
<lb/>On those whose evil seed hath come to fruit.
<lb/>Observe this letter and this ordinance,
<lb/>And turn not from the glorious Way and Faith.
<lb/>Demand with justice and with courtesy
<lb/>The instalment of the tax due each four months;
<lb/>But where the locusts have been ravaging,
<lb/>Or sunbeams beaten on the parched-up earth,
<lb/>Or where the blast or lightning of high heaven
<lb/>Hath brought disaster on the cultured fields,
<lb/>Or if rain falleth not at the New Year,
<lb/>So that the jocund crops are vexed with drought,
<lb/>Demand no tax upon those fields and crops,
<lb/>Because the spring-clouds have not watered them,
<lb/>And pay the seed sown and the labourers' hire
<lb/>Back to the farmers from the treasury.
<lb/>The lands whose owner is deceased and hath
<lb/>No kith and kin must lie not waste, for they
<lb/>Are underneath the shadow of the Shah;
<lb/>Else will the foe make scorn of my resources
<lb/>With such a pretext ready to his hand.
<lb/>Give what is needed from the treasury,
<lb/>For God hath set me out of reach of need.
<lb/>If lands within my power lie desolate,
<lb/>Unsheltered by the shadow of my wing,
<lb/>Whoe’er he be that is responsible,
<lb/>And doth neglect the task, hard though it be,
<lb/>Him, whether lord or underling, will I
<lb/>Hang from the gibbet on the spot. The great—
<lb/>The Shahs of yore—had other usages,

<pb n="229"/>

<lb/>With their officials rested right and wrong,
<lb/>The world lay open to the cavaliers,
<lb/>Who wantonly mocked wisdom and ne’er rested
<lb/>From adding to their wealth. My wealth is justice;
<lb/>The people of the land compose my host;
<lb/>I will not cast a glance upon dinars.
<lb/>To win by equity the world’s regard,
<lb/>And to respect the worth of men of birth,
<lb/>Are dearer to me than the wealth of foes
<lb/>That seek to win my kingdom and my throne.
<lb/>The general that selleth men for gold
<lb/>Shall get no entry to my court whereat
<lb/>They are esteemed that follow justice, love,
<lb/>Law and the Way. When my shrewd officers
<lb/>Assemble at the office of the archmage,
<lb/>And falsehood showeth in the words of any,
<lb/>He shall receive no grace from us henceforth.
<lb/>I do not love the man that is unjust;
<lb/>The leopard and the oppressor are as one.
<lb/>All they that have ensued the way of God,
<lb/>And bathed their dark souls in the stream of wisdom,
<lb/>Shall have a lofty station at our court,
<lb/>High estimation with the archimages,
<lb/>And from their God for that which they have sown
<lb/>The recompense of jocund Paradise.
<lb/>We are ourselves exempt from need of wealth
<lb/>Whereby the soul is diminished and accursed.
<lb/>He that doth eat the flesh of mendicants
<lb/>Will find, no doubt, some nurture in their skins.
<lb/>A pard is better than a king like that,
<lb/>Who hath no modesty, no rule, no Faith.
<lb/>The way of right is open to us. Why
<lb/>Knock we in folly on the door of loss?
<lb/>To do ill closely, justice openly,
<lb/>So that the fame thereof may come to us,
<lb/>Will have not God’s approval, or be held

<pb n="230"/>

<lb/>In high consideration at our court;
<lb/>But he hath God’s approval and our own
<lb/>Whose love and justice are as warp and woof.</p>

<p>
<lb/>If thou art just, O monarch! thou wilt give
<lb/>The world a record of thee that will live,
<lb/>For every one will praise eternally
<lb/>The Shah that brought the world prosperity.

<head>§ 4
How Nushirwan required Babak to muster the Host</head>
<p>
<lb/>Of all the Shahs that erst had throne and crown,
<lb/>And had been great in treasure and in troops,
<lb/>There was not one more just than Nushirwan,
<lb/>And may his soul be young for evermore.
<lb/>None was more worshipful for manhood, throne,
<lb/>For diadem and knowledge. He possessed
<lb/>An archimage, Babak by name, a man
<lb/>Of wisdom, shrewd of heart, and fortunate,
<lb/>Made him the muster-master of the host,
<lb/>And bade him to prepare himself an office
<lb/>Of ample size before the palace-gate,
<lb/>And higher than its top, and furnish it
<lb/>With carpets that were worthy of a king
<lb/>To seat the clerks engaged upon the work.
<lb/>A proclamation issued from his office,
<lb/>And all the folk gave ear: <q>Famed warriors!
<lb/>Mount and attend the portal of the Shah,
<lb/>All ye that would have guerdon at his hands!
<lb/>With iron helmets set upon your heads,
<lb/>Arrayed in mail and bearing ox-head maces.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The troops came to the office of Babak,
<lb/>The air was darkened by the horsemen’s dust.
<lb/>Now when Babak reviewed the host he missed<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<pb n="231"/>

<lb/>The standard and the chief of all the noble.
<lb/>He left the office, mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And bade the soldiers go back to their quarters.
<lb/>The turning sky continued on its course,
<lb/>And when the radiant sun displayed its face
<lb/>It was proclaimed before the palace-gate:
<q>Ye mace-men of the army of Iran!
<lb/>Go all in full array with arms and bows
<lb/>And lassos to the office of Babak.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>They went with lances, helms, and coats of mail;
<lb/>The army’s dust ascended to the clouds.
<lb/>Babak looked round upon the host but, since
<lb/>The Shah appeared not in his Grace and state,
<lb/>Thus spake: <q>Return glad and victorious
<lb/>In love and duty, each man to his quarters.</q>
<lb/>Again the third day rose the proclamation:—
<q>Ye men of name, of Grace divine and wisdom!
<lb/>Let there not be one horseman of this host
<lb/>Without his helmet and cuirass of war,
<lb/>And let him come and pass before this gate,
<lb/>And see his name upon the muster-roll.
<lb/>Let those that are distinguished by a crown,
<lb/>By Grace, by majesty, and lofty fortunes,
<lb/>Know that this muster is without respect
<lb/>Of persons, reticence, and modesty.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The king of kings gave ear thereto and heeded
<lb/>The proclamation from Babak’s divan,
<lb/>Then smiling called for coat of mail and helm,
<lb/>And held erect the flag of majesty.
<lb/>The Shah, with iron helmet on his head,
<lb/>Proceeded to the office of Babak.
<lb/>The chain-mail hung down from his Roman helm,
<lb/>And was secured by many a fastening.
<lb/>Within his hand he had an ox-head mace,
<lb/>Within his belt four shafts of poplar-wood,
<lb/>A bow on arm and lasso on the saddle.
<pb n="232"/>

<lb/>While round his loins he had a golden girdle.
<lb/>He urged his charger, gripping with his thighs,
<lb/>And laid the massive mace upon his shoulder;
<lb/>Then, lightly wheeling both to left and right,
<lb/>Displayed both steed and rider to Babak,
<lb/>Who when he had inspected them approved,
<lb/>And, having come up to the king of kings,
<lb/>Said thus to him: <q>O Shah! mayst thou be blessed!
<lb/>May wisdom be the provand of thy soul!
<lb/>Thou hast adorned the kingdom’s face with justice,
<lb/>Such that with us ‘tis thy memorial.
<lb/>What I have said was boldness from a slave,
<lb/>But never must thou turn from what is just;
<lb/>So now, I prithee, wheel thee to the right
<lb/>With all the skill whereof thou art the master.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan again urged on his steed
<lb/>To right and left as ‘twere Azargashasp.
<lb/>Babak looked on amazed and oft invoked
<lb/>The Maker of the world. A horseman’s pay
<lb/>Ran from a thousand to two thousand drachms;
<lb/>Four thousand were the most that any had.
<lb/>Babak paid to the Shah just one drachm more.
<lb/>Then from the office-door ‘twas cried: <q>Exhibit
<lb/>The charger of the first of warriors—
<lb/>The horseman of the world, the famous Shah,</q>
<lb/>While Nushirwan laughed heartily, for fortune
<lb/>Was young with him and he a youthful king.
<lb/>Now when Babak had left the royal office
<lb/>He came before the noble Shah and said:—
<q>Great Shah! if I, thy slave, made bold to-day
<lb/>The purpose of my heart was right and just:
<lb/>Let not the Shah take notice of my harshness;
<lb/>It is not harshness to discharge one’s duty,
<lb/>And blest is he who meant not to be harsh.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>“O man of wisdom!” said the Shah to him,
<q>Keep thyself ever in the path of right,
<pb n="233"/>

<lb/>Whereof thou break’st the heart by self-regard.
<lb/>Know that thou art the dearer in mine eyes;
<lb/>But mine anxiety is for myself—
<lb/>How, when the army is engaged in fight,
<lb/>I shall comport myself upon the field.</q>
<lb/>Babak made answer to the noble Shah:—
<q>No crown and signet will behold thy like,
<lb/>While painter hath observed not limned in hall
<lb/>A hand and rein like thine, O king! Oh! may
<lb/>High heaven accord to thee thy full desire,
<lb/>Oh! may thy heart be glad, thyself unscathed!</q>
<lb/>Thus to the archimage said Nushirwan:—
<q>Our justice shall make old folk young again.
<lb/>The king must leave as his memorial
<lb/>Within the world but righteousness alone.
<lb/>What need have we for such a treasury,
<lb/>Such toil and greed, and to confine our soul
<lb/>Within this Wayside Inn? The need, since here
<lb/>Is no abiding, is to eat and drink.
<lb/>I have been troubled with the world’s affairs,
<lb/>Although I kept these matters to myself,
<lb/>Because my royal crown hath enemies,
<lb/>And Ahriman doth compass me about.
<lb/>Methought: <q>I will bring troops from every side,
<lb/>And summon warriors from every province,
<lb/>But for the levy I have need of treasure,
<lb/>Which I have but to labour to amass;
<lb/>Still if this bringeth evil on the poor
<lb/>I must refrain my heart from this desire.</q>
<lb/>So I revolved this matter in my heart,
<lb/>And, having come upon a wise resolve,
<lb/>I wrote a letter to the paladins,
<lb/>The mighty men, and prudent archimages,
<lb/>To all the nobles and the potentates
<lb/>In all the provinces, and thus it ran:—
<q>All ye possessed of wisdom and of sense!
<pb n="234"/>

<lb/>Bring up your sons for military service,
<lb/>Dispatch them to the field equipped for war,
<lb/>And look to me for honour and reward.
<lb/>They must be able to distinguish hand
<lb/>And rein from stirrup on the hills and dales,
<lb/>And learn to battle with the enemy
<lb/>With mace and scimitar, with bow and arrow,
<lb/>Because a youth unskilled availeth naught
<lb/>Although he be descended from Arish.</q><note>For whom see Vol. v. p. 12.</note>
<lb/>The muster-master went forth from the court,
<lb/>With money for the chiefs, to every province,
<lb/>And now in sooth I have adorned the face
<lb/>Of earth with men prepared to take the field.
<lb/>I have more knowledge, policy, and method
<lb/>Than former Shahs, and greater armaments.</q>
<lb/>The archmage, when he heard the Shah speak thus,
<lb/>Called praises down upon the crown and throne.
<lb/>The payment was delayed for forty days,
<lb/>And then the athelings, equipped for war,
<lb/>Went to the office and received their pay
<lb/>While joyance was the order of the day.

<head>§ 5
How Nushirwan harangued the Iranians, and how the
Kings acknowledged his Supremacy</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the sun displayed its shining face,
<lb/>When circling heaven unlocked the garden-gate,
<lb/>And when the Mound of Fenugreek appeared
<lb/>While dark night’s tresses vanished, Nushirwan,
<lb/>All smiles, glad-hearted, and of youthful fortune,
<lb/>Sat on his throne, while all that sought redress
<lb/>Flocked to his court. The king harangued them thus:—

<pb n="235"/>

<lb/><q>Acknowledge that ye have not any helper
<lb/>Save holy God, the Lord of all, our Guide,
<lb/>Who leadeth us in both worlds by the hand.
<lb/>Fear not the throne and crown, the court is open
<lb/>To all, and ye soe’er that come thereto
<lb/>By day and night keep not your lips from speech.
<lb/>If we are quaffing wine in company,
<lb/>Or busied with advisors, or at polo,
<lb/>Or on the hunting-field, the way is open
<lb/>For you to us. Let access be withheld
<lb/>From none because I am asleep, awake,
<lb/>At work or play. Let none of you withdraw
<lb/>From us to sleep with wants unsatisfied.
<lb/>My heart will be rejoiced and bright whenever
<lb/>I break the travail of the oppressed. Please God,
<lb/>No officer of mine, no man at arms,
<lb/>No servitor, shall sleep with heart aggrieved,
<lb/>For from his grievance harm will come on me.
<lb/>However trifling or obscure the matter
<lb/>The Maker will require it at my hands.
<lb/>For tolls and imposts, other than the archmages
<lb/>Are now concerned with in mine offices,
<lb/>No gold or silver shall be asked of you,
<lb/>So sleep all unafraid of me henceforth.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Then sunward from the face of earth applause
<lb/>Rose from the hall: <q>May Nushirwan have Grace,
<lb/>And all his years the crown of king of kings!
<lb/>Ne’er may the throne, the state, and famous crown
<lb/>Of sovereignty be void of him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They went
<lb/>Their ways, glad and rejoicing, and earth’s face
<lb/>Grew like the garden of Iram.<note n="1">See Vol. i. p. 100.</note>
<lb/>Thou hadst not
<lb/>Seen any one despondent in the world,
<lb/>While from the clouds came seasonable rain,
<lb/>The world resembled jocund Paradise,
<pb n="236"/>

<lb/>The clouds sowed tulips in the pleasances,
<lb/>The dales, the plains, and orchards shone like lamps,
<lb/>The uplands were like garths, garths like the sun.
<lb/>Thereafter tidings came to Rum and Hind:
<q>Iran is like fine painted silk of Rum;
<lb/>The Shah hath decked with armaments and justice
<lb/>The earth till it is like the shining moon.
<lb/>No one in all the world doth know the sum
<lb/>Of all his forces save the Shah himself.
<lb/>They all are blithe of heart and dight for war,
<lb/>Have fame and glory and illumine the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The kings of all the realms were sore amazed
<lb/>At heart; their souls were dark through Nushirwan.
<lb/>Ambassadors arrived from Hind and Chin,
<lb/>And all kings called down praises on the Shah;
<lb/>They saw that they could counter not his might,
<lb/>And hasted to pay tribute with good will,
<lb/>Bare them as underlords to Nushirwan,
<lb/>And gathered slaves and purses for his service.
<lb/>With golden maces and with golden crowns
<lb/>The envoys went upon their way. They reached
<lb/>The court-gate of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And brought the toll and tribute of their lords.
<lb/>The court appeared adorned like Paradise
<lb/>Through all those purses, slaves, and audience-seekers.
<lb/>Thus for a while the heavens turned above,
<lb/>Consorting with the Iranian king in love.
</p>

</div>

<div>

<head>§ 6
How Nushirwan went round his Empire and built a Wall
in the Pass between Iran and Turan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan, the wise, made this resolve—
<lb/>That he would sojourn for a while abroad
<pb n="237"/>

<lb/>To make the circuit of the jocund world,
<lb/>And bring whate’er was hidden to the light.
<lb/>He beat the kettledrums, marched forth the host,
<lb/>And sun and moon were both astound at him.
<lb/>What with the troops and jewels, gold and silver,
<lb/>The golden girdles and the golden shields,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>No gold is left within
<lb/>The mines, no gems or lustrous pearls remain!</q>
<lb/>He led his host toward Khorasan at leisure,
<lb/>All heedful of Sassanian precedent.
<lb/>Whenever he passed settlements he pitched
<lb/>His camp and camp-enclosure on the waste,
<lb/>And when the blare of clarions rose there went
<lb/>A herald first afoot who thus proclaimed:
<q>Ye subjects of the monarch of the world!
<lb/>Is any privily aggrieved at us?
<lb/>Sleep not despairing of the Shah, allow not
<lb/>Your souls to fail with care.</q>
<lb/>He led the host
<lb/>Thus to Gurgan and bore with him the crown
<lb/>And throne of chiefs. Know, justice is no loss:
<lb/>Shahs should have prowess, rede, and noble birth.
<lb/>Now when the nightingales were full of song
<lb/>They went thence toward Sari and toward Amul,
<lb/>Where hill and plain were clothed with forest-trees,
<lb/>Which filled the Iranian monarch’s heart with thought.
<lb/>He left the plain and mounting to the heights,
<lb/>Still seated on his Arab bay looked out
<lb/>O’er mountain and o’er forest, and observed
<lb/>Rose, hyacinth and game, and water there,
<lb/>And thus he said: <q>O Thou almighty Judge,
<lb/>The World-lord, Conqueror, and Fosterer!
<lb/>Thou art the Maker of the sun and moon,
<lb/>The Guide and the Revealer of the way.
<lb/>Thou mad’st the world of such delightsomeness
<lb/>That we distinguish not 'twixt earth and Heaven.
<pb n="238"/>

<lb/>Whoe’er shall worship any save Thyself
<lb/>Will send his soul to Hell. It was for this
<lb/>That pious Faridun forwent Iran,
<lb/>And made his dwelling here, so passing fair
<lb/>Is this place and delightsome to the heart,
<lb/>Where water is rose-water and the soil
<lb/>Is spicery.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O righteous judge!
<lb/>If this were not a highway for the Turkmans
<lb/>Our hearts would be not empty of delight,
<lb/>Such are the wealth and glory of this place;
<lb/>But as it is we cannot raise our necks
<lb/>For constant murders, sack, and harryings.
<lb/>There are not many left or even few
<lb/>Of fowl or men or cattle on this spot.
<lb/>This is the only route between the realms,
<lb/>And causes loss to the Iranian folk.
<lb/>There came much toil and strife in former times,
<lb/>But then the Turkman route was through Kharazm.
<lb/>Now for the merchant or the thane to raise
<lb/>His head would be in vain. However, now
<lb/>That thou hast led an army to these parts,
<lb/>Avert this ill from us and bar the way.
<lb/>Thy treasures will be more, not less, thereby:
<lb/>Now is the time to render us a service.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, whenas he heard the supplicant,
<lb/>Showered tear-drops from his eyes and thereupon
<lb/>Addressed his minister and said to him:
<q>A very grievous toil confronteth us.
<lb/>Henceforth 'tis not for us to fare and feast,
<lb/>Or even tender our own crown, for God
<lb/>Will sanction not the wrong in us that we
<lb/>Shall be in happiness while thanes are grieving.
<lb/>Such mountains as these are, such spacious plains,
<lb/>All fit for gardens, grounds, and palaces,
<lb/>And filled with cattle, game, and running water,
<pb n="239"/>

<lb/>So that the soul is freshened by the sight—
<lb/>We must not let the Turkmans lay them waste,
<lb/>And desolate the country of Iran.
<lb/>My kingly office, prudence, policy,
<lb/>Humanity itself, will brook it not.
<lb/>Men will invoke not blessings on our heads
<lb/>What time Iran is lying desolate.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He bade his minister: <q>From Hind and Rum
<lb/>Select men famous in those cultured lands
<lb/>From all the provinces, foreseeing men,
<lb/>Such masters in their craft as thou canst find,
<lb/>And build me from the sea a lofty wall,
<lb/>On broad foundations and ten lassos high,
<lb/>Of stone and mortar, starting from the deep,
<lb/>And rising to the fountain of the sun.
<lb/>In this way surely we shall form a bar,
<lb/>And loss from foes will come not on Iran.
<lb/>Use no forced labour, open our treasury,
<lb/>And pay to every one what he demandeth.
<lb/>The labourer, the thane, and man of birth
<lb/>Must not be incommoded by the blast.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He made an old archmage the overseer,
<lb/>And shut out all the desert by the wall,
<lb/>Wherein they set a mighty iron door,
<lb/>And all the flock grew fearless of the wolf.
<lb/>Of frontier-guards he stationed many a post,
<lb/>And, having made all safe, led on the host.

<head>§ 7
How Nushirwan chastised the Alans and the Men of
Baluch and Gilan<note n="1">Literally, “rubbed the ears of."</note></head>
<p>
<lb/>Thence from the sea he went toward the Alans,
<lb/>And finding there a ravaged, barren march
<pb n="240"/>

<lb/>He thus addressed his chiefs: <q>It is a shame
<lb/>For regions in Iran to lie thus waste,
<lb/>And we must suffer not our foes to say so.</q>
<lb/>He chose an envoy from among the troops,
<lb/>One, as was fitting, wise and eloquent,
<lb/>To whom he said: <q>Depart hence with the dawn,
<lb/>And say thus to the marchlords of yon folk:
<lb/>‘From mine intelligencers have I heard
<lb/>All that hath passed in public and in private,
<lb/>And that ye say: “Why fear we Nushirwan?
<lb/>As for Iran it is a pinch of dust.”</q>

<lb/>Now have we come anigh you and set up
<lb/>Our camp, our camp-enclosures, and our court.
<lb/>Your wastes are spacious and your mountains high,
<lb/>Your troops are armed with arrow, mace, and lasso.
<lb/>Your gorges are the place for ambuscades,
<lb/>Land, mountain, field and fell, are all your own.
<lb/>We—general and soldiers—challenge you,
<lb/>We who are strangers in a foreign land.’
<lb/>The envoy went his way and spake the words
<lb/>Dictated by the monarch of Iran.
<lb/>The host of the Alans assembled—all
<lb/>The great, the sages, and the counsellors—
<lb/>A host that found employ in pillaging,
<lb/>And recked but little for the Iranians.
<lb/>Iran was wont to stand in awe of them:
<lb/>Folk had no raiment, gold, or silver left,
<lb/>And men and women with their babes and beasts
<lb/>Were wont to quit their homes and seek the plains.
<lb/>The envoy told the Alans, withholding naught,
<lb/>The message of the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Whereat the faces of the chiefs grew black;
<lb/>The words of Nushirwan amazed their hearts.
<lb/>The great men and the chieftains of that march
<lb/>Went forth with contributions and much tribute,
<lb/>With slaves and raiment, and with gold and silver,
<pb n="241"/>

<lb/>And many a noble steed, while of the folk
<lb/>All that were men of years and eloquence,
<lb/>And wisdom-seekers, came to Nushirwan,
<lb/>Bewailing their past doings. When they reached
<lb/>The tent-enclosure of the Shah with presents,
<lb/>And gifts, they cried and wallowed in the dust,
<lb/>Their eyes fulfilled with tears, their hearts with blood.
<lb/>For shame and self-excusing is no need
<lb/>When wisdom and the valiant are agreed.
<lb/>The prudent Shah was gracious unto them,
<lb/>And pardoned all that they had done amiss;
<lb/>Then ordered that upon the wasted lands—
<lb/>The lurking-place of lion and of leopard—
<lb/>They should erect a city with all speed,
<lb/>With room for sowing and for harvesting,
<lb/>The whole surrounded by a lofty wall
<lb/>That ill might not befall from enemies.
<lb/>The Alans made answer to the noble king,
<lb/>And said: <q>With earrings on as slaves of thine,
<lb/>And, as the Shah hath bidden, we will raise
<lb/>The ramparts of a noble seat.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah
<lb/>Marched thence to Hindustan and sojourned there.
<lb/>At his commandment all folk came to him,
<lb/>Came seeking to ingratiate themselves,
<lb/>And for two miles beside the Indus-bank
<lb/>Were horses, elephants, brocade, and coin.
<lb/>The great men all with honesty of heart
<lb/>And loyalty appeared before the Shah,
<lb/>Who questioned them and well entreated them,
<lb/>And placed them in accordance to their rank.
<lb/>With jocund heart the Shah departed thence:
<lb/>Troops, steeds, and elephants fulfilled the world.
<lb/>He went his way, and tidings came to him:
<q>The world is wasted by the Baluchis,
<lb/>Till from exceeding slaughter, pillaging,
<pb n="242"/>

<lb/>And harrying, the earth is overwhelmed,
<lb/>But greater ruin cometh from Gilan,
<lb/>And curses banish blessings.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the heart
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, the Shah, was sorrowful,
<lb/>And grief commingled with his joy. He said
<lb/>To the Iranians: <q>The Alans and Hind
<lb/>Were, in their terror of our scimitars,
<lb/>Like silk. Now our own realm is turned against us:
<lb/>Shall we hunt lions and forgo the sheep?</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>One said to him: <q>The garden hath no rose
<lb/>Without a thorn, O king! So too these marches
<lb/>Are ever troublesome and treasure-wasting.
<lb/>As for Baluch the glorious Ardeshir
<lb/>Tried it with all his veteran officers,
<lb/>But all his stratagems and artifices,
<lb/>His feints, his labours, arms, and fighting failed,
<lb/>And though the enterprise succeeded ill
<lb/>He cloaked the failure even to himself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>This story of the thane enraged the Shah,
<lb/>Who went upon his way toward Baluch.
<lb/>Now when he drew anigh those lofty mountains
<lb/>He went around them with his retinue,
<lb/>And all his host encircled them about,
<lb/>And barred the passage e’en to wind and ant.
<lb/>The troops, like ants and locusts, occupied
<lb/>The mountain-outskirts to the sandy desert.
<lb/>A herald went his rounds about the host,
<lb/>Proclaiming from the mountains, caves, and plains:
<q>Whene’er the Baluchis are seeking food,
<lb/>If they be warriors and carry arms,
<lb/>However many or however few,
<lb/>Let not a single one of them escape.</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>The troops, aware of the anger of the Shah,
<lb/>Stopped every outlet with their horse and foot;
<lb/>Few of the Baluchis or none survived,
<pb n="243"/>

<lb/>No women, children, warriors, were left.
<lb/>All of them perished by the scimitar,
<lb/>And all their evil doings had an end,
<lb/>The world had quiet from their ravaging:
<lb/>No Baluchi, seen or unseen, remained,
<lb/>While on their mountains, so it came to pass,
<lb/>The herds thenceforward strayed without a guard;
<lb/>Alike on waste and lofty mountain-top
<lb/>The sheep required no shepherd. All the folk
<lb/>Around thought nothing of past sufferings,
<lb/>And looked on vale and mountain as their home.
<lb/>Thence toward Gilan marched Nushirwan, for there,
<lb/>And in Daylam, was trouble manifest.
<lb/>The army stretched from sea to mountain-top,
<lb/>The air was full of flags, the earth of troops.
<lb/>The army was extended round Gilan,
<lb/>And light departed from the sun and moon.
<lb/>Thus spake the Shah: <q>Among the small and great
<lb/>No trace of Wolf and Lion must be left.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So mighty was the slaughter in the land
<lb/>That all the region’s face was bathed in blood.
<lb/>At all the slaying, pillaging, and burning
<lb/>The men and women sent up wails of woe.
<lb/>On every side the slain were piled in heaps,
<lb/>The grasses smirched with brains. The warriors—
<lb/>The just, the prudent, and the men of weight—
<lb/>Remaining in Gilan bound their own hands,
<lb/>And with their women-folk behind, their children
<lb/>Before them, came lamenting to the king
<lb/>With bosoms rent and dust upon their heads.
<lb/>They all assembled at the monarch’s court
<lb/>With bounden hands and wounded bodies, saying:
<q>We have turned back upon our evil courses;
<lb/>Oh! that the Shah would cease from his displeasure!
<lb/>If he is vexed at heart against Gilan
<lb/>We will behead ourselves with our own hands.
<pb n="244"/>

<lb/>It may be that the Shah then will relent
<lb/>When he shall see the heaps of severed heads.</q>
<lb/>When such a cry rose from the court, and when
<lb/>The Shah had listened to their supplication,
<lb/>He pardoned them; the past was blotted out,
<lb/>But he required two hundred hostages
<lb/>Both from Gilan and from Daylam that none
<lb/>Thereafter might pursue the path of ill.
<lb/>He left a paladin with them to stay,
<lb/>And, having ordered all things, marched away.

How Munzir, the Arab, came to Nushirwan for Succour
against the Injustice of Caesar</head>
<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1634"/>
<lb/>Next from Gilan he marched toward Madain,
<lb/>Not knowing his troops’ number or extent.<note n="1">They were so many.</note>
<lb/>Now as he journeyed on appeared afar
<lb/>A boundless host of wielders of the spear.
<lb/>A cavalier—one of that great array—
<lb/>Approached as quick as dust on their behalf,
<lb/>And, having lighted from his charger, said:
<q>Behold Munzir the Arab.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When Munzir
<lb/>Drew near the Shah all chiefs made way for him.
<lb/>The Shah saluted him with signs of joy,
<lb/>And brightened at his looks. That veteran
<lb/>Set loose his tongue, discoursed of Rum and Caesar,
<lb/>And said: <q>If thou art monarch of Iran,
<lb/>The guardian and the backbone of the brave,
<lb/>Why do the Romans lord it so and prance
<lb/>Upon the desert of the cavaliers?
<lb/>While if the Shah be Caesar’s overlord
<pb n="245"/>

<lb/>That haughty potentate should lose his head.
<lb/>Now if the noble Shah will give permission
<lb/>No more will he behold us asking aid,
<lb/>And in the fight the horsemen of the desert
<lb/>Shall triumph o’er the cavaliers of Rum.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah was wroth that Caesar should exalt
<lb/>His crown, as said Munzir, and, having chosen
<lb/>Among the troops a man of eloquence,
<lb/>And learned in Caesar’s tongue, said thus: <q>Go thou
<lb/>To Rum, take not thine ease in peopled parts,
<lb/>And say to Caesar: ‘If thou lackest wisdom
<lb/>Thy brains will sorrow for thy policy.
<lb/>The warrior-lion chasing onager
<lb/>Will batten on them even in a salt-marsh.
<lb/>For thee to have thy just dues from Munzir
<lb/>Sufficeth seeing that Vega is his throne.
<lb/>Discern then 'twixt thy left hand and thy right,
<lb/>And, when thou knowest, claim what march is thine.
<lb/>Since I am the distributor of lands
<lb/>And realms, am highest in the world and chief,
<lb/>My conduct shall be worthy of myself:
<lb/>I will let not the wind blow on Munzir.
<lb/>Since thou hast stretched thy hand upon the Arabs
<lb/>In fight take privy heed for thine own self.
<lb/>Moreover all that sovereignty is mine,
<lb/>And mine is all between the Bull<note n="1">See Vol. i. p. 71. </note>
<lb/>and Pisces.
<lb/>If I shall send an army into Rum
<lb/>Thy sword of steel will prove a sword of wax.’</q><note n="2">Because "mum," wax, rhymes with “Rum.”</note>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The ambassador came forth from Nushirwan
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1635"/>
<lb/>As 'twere a torrent, came and gave the message
<lb/>To Caesar, but that worthless one recoiled
<lb/>From what was just, replied evasively,
<lb/>Imagining a fall from power remote,
<lb/>And answered thus: <q>As for that fool Munzir,
<lb/>Take what he stateth at its proper worth.
<pb n="246"/>

<lb/>If he complaineth out of wantonness,
<lb/>Exaggerating thus the evil done,
<lb/>Or if a single man complain within
<lb/>The desert of the wielders of the spear,
<lb/>I will convert the heights of earth to breadths,
<lb/>And that unwatered desert to a sea.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The envoy heard, came swift as dust, and told
<lb/>The words of Caesar. Nushirwan enraged
<lb/>Said to his minister: <q>The brains of Caesar
<lb/>Are wedded not to wisdom. I will show him
<lb/>Who hath authority, the power to conquer
<lb/>The world, to levy war, and make a pact.
<lb/>His overweening and his haughtiness,
<lb/>His labour, pillaging, and harrying,
<lb/>He shall repent more dearly than the drunkard,<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>That thrusteth both hands in the fire at night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He then bade blow the trumpets, and a host
<lb/>Was gathered unto him from every side;
<lb/>The din of tymbals went up from the court-gate,
<lb/>Earth was pitch-hued and air was ebony.
<lb/>He chose of cavaliers from that famed host
<lb/>A hundred thousand armed with scimitars,
<lb/>Entrusted that great army to Munzir,
<lb/>And bade him: <q>From the desert of the spearmen
<lb/>Lead unto Rum an army of the brave
<lb/>To set the frontier and the land afire,
<lb/>For youthful monarch though I be and though
<lb/>I am but newly famed in fight,
<lb/>Yet fear not Rum or Roman, thou! for I
<lb/>Regard the Roman as a pinch of dust.
<lb/>Now will I send me an ambassador—
<lb/>A man of eloquence—to him. Henceforth,
<lb/>If thou experience naught calamitous,

The Letter of Shah Nushirwan to Caesar of Rum</head>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah then called a scribe that was at court,
<lb/>And bade to write a letter unto Caesar:—<note n="1">In C. the previous section ends here.</note>
<q>From Nushirwan, the Shah of glorious birth,
<lb/>The world-lord and successor of Kavad,<note n="2">Cf. p. 179, note.</note>

<lb/>The letter opened with the praise of God
<lb/>From whom alone all greatness must be sought—
<q>The Master of the circling sun and moon,
<lb/>The Source of victory and mastery,
<lb/>Who is above the will of turning heaven
<lb/>As touching justice, love, and strife. Though thou
<lb/>Art Caesar and the lord of Rum, dispute not
<lb/>Aught with the Arabs, for if thou shalt take
<lb/>The sheep out of the clutches of the wolf
<lb/>Thou wilt, as thou art ware, have grievous toil;
<lb/>While if thou sendest troops against Munzir
<lb/>I will not leave thee host or crown or throne.
<lb/>If any underling grow masterful
<lb/>He shall be punished by our scimitar.
<lb/>Step not a single cubit past thy bounds
<lb/>If thou desirest that our pact shall stand.
<lb/>If thou shalt pass thy bounds, we will pass ours,
<lb/>And trample under foot thy head and throne.
<lb/>The greeting of the lord of diadem
<lb/>And might to those that seek not to cause trouble
<lb/>By their injustice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Unto this they set
<lb/>The Shah’s seal and then chose a cavalier,
<lb/>Such as was needful, from the court, a man
<lb/>Persuasive, valiant, shrewd, and veteran.

How the Letter of Nushirwan reached Caesar and how
he replied</head>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy with the letter of the king
<lb/>Came to famed Caesar, gave it, greeted him,
<lb/>And told him all the mind of Nushirwan.
<lb/>When Caesar heard and had perused the letter
<lb/>He writhed and was astound. His brow grew wrinkled,
<lb/>His visage wan at what the exalted Shah
<lb/>Had said. He called a scribe, wrote his reply,
<lb/>And made his meaning clear for good and ill.
<lb/>The letter first grew musky with the ink
<lb/>What time he offered praise to God almighty—
<q>The Artist of the heavens over us,
<lb/>The Source of warfare, peace, and amity.
<lb/>He giveth in the world one man a crown
<lb/>With slaves before him better than himself.
<lb/>Though turning heaven itself be under thee,
<lb/>And Jupiter beneath thy scimitar,
<lb/>Search out thy records, for no son of Rum
<lb/>E’er hath paid tribute to thy royal race.
<lb/>King as thou art I am no less than thou;
<lb/>I too possess a head, a crown, and realm.
<lb/>Why must I take so much abuse in fear
<lb/>Of foot of elephant or din of drum?
<lb/>I now ask you for tribute and for toll,
<lb/>And who is there with power to fight with Rum?
<lb/>The doings of Sikandar in Iran
<lb/>Thou knowest, and we claim that noble Shah.
<lb/>Sikandar’s sword is still in evidence,
<lb/>Why pickest thou a quarrel with us thus?
<lb/>The javelin-wielding horsemen of the waste
<lb/>Have pillaged our possessions in their raids:
<lb/>No longer will we bear their wrongs but raise
<pb n="249"/>

<lb/>The dust in all their borders. Nushirwan
<lb/>Was neither Maker of the sun, nor hath
<lb/>He seized the key of the revolving sky,
<lb/>That there must be no other king of kings,
<lb/>And his will only current in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave the envoy no reply in speech,
<lb/>Not recking of the wrath of Nushirwan,
<lb/>But, when he set the seal upon the letter,
<lb/>He spake these words: <q>Christ and the Cross are with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The envoy spent no breath on him, perceiving
<lb/>With grief the answer, and with grief departed;
<lb/>Swift as a dust-cloud to the Shah he sped,
<lb/>And told him all that Caesar purposed.
</p>

</div>
<div>
<head>§ 11
How Nushirwan went to war with Caesar</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king, when he had read the letter, raged
<lb/>Against the turn of fortune. Then he called
<lb/>The archmages and the chieftains, one and all,
<lb/>And spake to them at large about that letter.
<lb/>He sat for three days with his counsellors
<lb/>And paladins—the shatterers of hosts—
<lb/>And on the fourth day was resolved to lead
<lb/>His troops to fight with Caesar. At the gate
<lb/>Arose the blare of trumpets with the din
<lb/>Of brazen cymbals and of drums. He paused not,
<lb/>But went to battle in a righteous cause,
<lb/>Assembled troops, made up the baggage-train,
<lb/>And called on God, the Giver of all good.
<lb/>A dust rose such that thou hadst said: “The sky
<lb/>Hath smirched its visage in a sea of pitch!”</p>

<p>He clad the surface of the earth with horse-shoes,
<pb n="250"/>
<lb/>While silken flags incarnadined the air.
<lb/>There was no room on earth e’en for a gnat,
<lb/>No room for wind left in the firmament.
<lb/>The hubbub of the horsemen and the dust
<lb/>Of elephants made earth seem like the Nile.
<lb/>The world-lord marched with Kéwa’s flag, with crown,
<lb/>And golden boots. The army’s din was heard
<lb/>Two miles away. Before the host were drums
<lb/>And elephants, and on this wise the Shah,
<lb/>With chiefs behind him and with chiefs before him,
<lb/>Sped onward to Azar Abédagan.
<lb/>Now when his eyes beheld Azargashasp
<lb/>Afar he lighted down and went afoot,
<lb/>Requested of his pious minister
<lb/>The sacred twigs and bathed his cheeks with tears.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1638"/>
<lb/>He made his entry of the Fane of Fire
<lb/>With wailing. They set up a throne inlaid
<lb/>With gold, and spread thereon the Zandavasta,
<lb/>Wherefrom an archimagus read aloud,
<lb/>According to the ritual, while priests
<lb/>And chieftains wallowed in the dust before it,
<lb/>And rent their skirts. The great men showered jewels
<lb/>Upon the book and muttered laud thereon.
<lb/>The Shah approaching offered praise and prayer
<lb/>Before the Maker of the world, and asked
<lb/>For victory, for mastery, and guidance
<lb/>Upon the path of justice. He bestowed
<lb/>Gifts on the attendants and on mendicants
<lb/>Wherever seen. He pitched his tent before
<lb/>The Fire-fane, and his troops arrayed their ranks
<lb/>Upon each side. He called a prudent scribe,
<lb/>Discoursed at large, dictating fitting words,
<lb/>Bade him address by letter graciously
<lb/>The marchlords of the country of Iran,
<lb/>And say: “Fear God, be vigilant, and guard
<lb/>The world against the enemy. Ye lords
<pb n="251"/>
<lb/>And paladins! be just to those beneath you,
<lb/>And keep such forces as will foil the foe.
<lb/>None while my standard shall be out of sight
<lb/>Must think to slumber in security.”</p>

<p>As from the Fane of Fire he marched towards Rum
<lb/>The bruit of him was spread throughout the land,
<lb/>And all the faithful lieges flocked to him
<lb/>Until the warriors<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/> hid the fields and fells,
<lb/>And many an aspirant came with gifts
<lb/>And offerings to the king. Where’er he lighted
<lb/>There reached him salutations and addresses
<lb/>From all sides, while where’er he led his host
<lb/>He still had feast and chase before his eyes,
<lb/>And ’twas the custom for a thousand chiefs
<lb/>To come each night to banquet with the king.
<lb/>When he was near the frontier he made ready
<lb/>For war and in the first place paid his troops.
<lb/>His general was Shirwi, son of Bakram—
<lb/>A man of rede and self-possessed in battle.
<lb/>He gave the army’s left wing to Farhad,
<lb/>To whom he proffered many prudent counsels.
<lb/>Ust 4d, son of Barzin, was on the right,
<lb/>Garshasp, the atheling, was o’er the baggage.
<lb/>Mihran<note n="2">Cf. p. 185.</note>
<lb/> was at the centre, for his heart
<lb/>Was steadfast in the fray. The outpost duty
<lb/>The Shah gave to Hurmuz, son of Kharrad,
<lb/>Enjoining wisdom to his soul and heart,
<lb/>While everywhere intelligencers went
<lb/>That nothing might be hidden. Then the Shah
<lb/>Called and advised his veterans much and well.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1639"/>
<lb/>He said to them: “Ye numbers numberless
<lb/>Of men of high estate and warriors!
<lb/>If any one of you shall quit my way,
<lb/>Or draw a breath without my privity,
<lb/>Shall cause affliction to the mendicants,
<lb/>Or to the mighty men possessed of treasure,
<lb/>Shall injure any tree that beareth fruit,
<lb/>Or do an act unseemly, trample down
<lb/>The cornfields, or leave station to advance
<lb/>Before the troops, I swear by God, the Lord
<lb/>Of Mars, of Saturn, and of Sol, who gave me
<lb/>The diadem and might, forthwith to cleave him
<lb/>Asunder with my sword though like a star
<lb/>He hide him in the clouds. I am the scout
<lb/>Before the host, aspirant, central stay,
<lb/>Guard of the elephants, of troops, and baggage,
<lb/>Am now upon the left, now on the right.
<lb/>I fare o’er land and sea, I seek no rest
<lb/>And sleep in war.”
<lb/>A herald named Shirzéd
<lb/>Laid up at heart the words of Nushirwan,
<lb/>And made in haste the circuit of the host,
<lb/>Went round about tent and pavilion,
<lb/>And cried: “Ye troops in numbers numberless!
<lb/>The bidding of the watchful Shah is this:
<lb/>Whoever, save in justice, love, and wisdom,
<lb/>Shall look upon this gloomy earth of ours,
<lb/>Men shall pour out his blood thereon as one
<lb/>That hath departed from the will of God.”
<lb/>A proclamation did not satisfy
<lb/>The Shah who night and day employed himself
<lb/>In going on his rounds about the host,
<lb/>Observing everything both good and bad,
<lb/>Receiving tidings of the world’s affairs,
<lb/>And slighting nothing whether good or ill.
<lb/>When any soldier died upon the march
<lb/>The Shah prepared a charnel at the place,
<lb/>And all the man’s belongings—silver, gold,
<lb/>His bow, his helm, his lasso and his belt,
<lb/>Or good or bad, were buried with the dead,
<lb/>Who in the grave had still his goods with him.
<pb n="253"/>
<lb/>The world was lost in wonder at the height
<lb/>Of majesty attained by Nushirwan.
<lb/>In every place where he engaged in battle
<lb/>He showed his counsel, caution, and good sense,
<lb/>And used to call a trusty messenger,
<lb/>Who went to foes preparing for resistance,
<lb/>And if they entered on the path of right
<lb/>The wise Shah treated them with clemency;
<lb/>But, if they fought, that valiant Crocodile
<lb/>Was very wroth, went forth to fight with them,
<lb/>And gave their fields and crops to spoil. He wooed
<lb/>The world with justice and the scimitar.
<lb/>The conduct of the Shah was like the sun’s,
<lb/>Which shineth in its course on wet and dry,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1640"/>
<lb/>Denying unto none its radiance,
<lb/>When banishing the clouds from circling heaven,
<lb/>But giving all its justice and its bounty,
<lb/>Its hue and scent, its lustrous pearls and waters,
<lb/>Obscuring unto none its light and height,
<lb/>But joying hearts and simply shining on.
<lb/>The king of kings by justice, policy,
<lb/>And Grace took all the world beneath his wings;
<lb/>Both war and bounty were mere play to him,
<lb/>And thus it was that he attained his greatness.
<lb/>Confronted by the elephant and lion
<lb/>He ne’er deferred the combat for a day,
<lb/>And when a foe was instant to appear
<lb/>In helm and mail before the host for fight,
<lb/>Him would they slaughter or in scorn would fling
<lb/>Bound in the dungeons of the conquering king.

How Nushirwan took divers Strongholds in his
March to Rum</head>
<p>
<lb/>He marched upon this wise until he reached
<lb/>A busy city which was named Shitrab,
<lb/>Wherein Gushtasp dwelt when he went to Rum.<note>See Vol. iv. p. 325.</note>
<lb/>The Shah beheld it rising in the air,
<lb/>Fulfilled with men and goods, with harp and song,
<lb/>With stone-foundations springing from the deep,
<lb/>And battlements up-builded to the clouds.
<lb/>The troops beleaguered it but saw no means
<lb/>Of access to the gate. The Shah set up
<lb/>The catapults on all four sides, and then
<lb/>The ramparts of the Christian crumbled down.
<lb/>From every quarter came the breath of doom;
<lb/>Men saw no place of refuge or escape,
<lb/>And when the shining sun set in the sky
<lb/>The castle-walls were level with the plain.
<lb/>The shouts of cavaliers, the dust of troops,
<lb/>And fume of fire ascended to the moon.
<lb/>The stronghold was all trunkless heads and feet,
<lb/>Elsewhere were headless trunks. The cries for quarter,
<lb/>And women’s shrieks, rose o’er the drummers’ din.
<lb/>The magnates eminent for wealth or valour
<lb/>They bound and laid upon the elephants,
<lb/>While wails of woe and cries for quarter rose.
<lb/>The Shah spared none in battle-tide, he spared not
<lb/>His treasures and dinars in banquet-time.
<lb/>He marched thence till another hold appeared,
<lb/>Wherein were Caesar’s treasures, and it had
<lb/>A mighty man for castellan. 'Twas called
<lb/>Ardyish-i-Rum till that Nushirwan
<milestone unit="calced" n="1645"/>
<lb/>Ill-ended it. The watchful Shah surveyed
<pb n="255"/>
<lb/>That hold, unentered yet by hostile troops,
<lb/>And bade shoot showers of arrows till the air
<lb/>Was thick with them as 'tis with hail in spring.
<lb/>The chieftains bravely stormed the walls and flung
<lb/>Fire on the city and the citadel,
<lb/>Wherein no living thing remained alive
<lb/>Or, in the country round, a thorn or briar.
<lb/>The Shah gave Caesar’s treasures up to spoil,
<lb/>And all the crowns and purses to his troops.
<lb/>He brought the Day of Doom upon that city,
<lb/>And all folk fled. Men, women, children, wailed
<lb/>Till old and young assembling came before
<lb/>The noble Shah and cried aloud for succour:—
<lb/>"The ministers, the treasurers, and treasure,
<lb/>Are thine, and thine the gain and toil in Rum;
<lb/>We only beg of thee to spare our lives,
<lb/>We bondslaves of the Glory of thy crown.”
<lb/>The Shah bade cease the slaughtering, and he
<lb/>Provided for these people bounteously.

<head>§ 13
The Battle of Nushirwan with Farfuriyus, the Leader of Caesar’s
Host, the Victory of Nushirwan, and his Capture of Kaliniyus and Antakiya</head>
<p>
<lb/>Departing thence the Shah led on his troops,
<lb/>And left Ardyish-i-Rum in his rear.
<lb/>One came and told him: "Caesar hath dispatched
<lb/>A host and lo! it draweth nigh."</p>

<p>On hearing
<lb/>Of that great power's approach—all spears and mail—
<lb/>The Shah proclaimed the tidings to the troops
<lb/>That all the host might be prepared. They marched
<lb/>As 'twere an iron mountain; battle-cries
<pb n="256"/>
<lb/>Ascended and the blast of clarions.
<lb/>A courier with tidings from the scouts
<lb/>Appeared before the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And told him: "Caesar hath dispatched an army
<lb/>Formed of his famous men and warriors.
<lb/>Their leader is a mighty paladin,
<lb/>Whose name in Ruman is Farfuriyus—
<lb/>A haughty cavalier with trump and drum—
<lb/>And all his troops long for the fight like wolves."</p>

<p>While thus he spake before the watchful Shah
<lb/>The dust-clouds of the advancing host appeared.
<lb/>He smiled and answered thus the messenger:—
<lb/>"The thing is not unknown to us, for we
<lb/>Already have prepared the host for battle:
<lb/>Such thoughts ne'er have been absent from our minds."</p>

<p>Then with his lips afoam he gave command
<lb/>That all the army should draw up in line.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1642"/> So host with host confronted, and the air
<lb/>Was hindered in its passage by the dust.
<lb/>It was a glorious gathering of troops,
<lb/>Proud chiefs and wielders of the scimitar,
<lb/>All with loins tightly girded for the fray—
<lb/>The great, the sages, and the seed of kings.
<lb/>The swords of all were reeking with fresh blood,
<lb/>And trenchant of the clouds. The enemy
<lb/>Had no more respite than the quarry hath
<lb/>From leopard springing. Ruman slain lay heaped
<lb/>On all sides while the wounded turned from fight.
<lb/>Farfuriyus himself thus stricken fled
<lb/>The field with banner rent and drums o'erthrown.
<lb/>The horsemen of Iran like pards, when they
<lb/>Clutch on the waste the mountain-sheep, pursued
<lb/>The Romans, sweeping them from dale and desert.
<lb/>The Shah marched on again equipped for war,
<lb/>The soldiers all with mace and sword in hand.
<lb/>He led his army on along a plain
<pb n="257"/>
<lb/>Until another lofty hold appeared—
<lb/>A citadel with soldiers, trump, and drum,
<lb/>And hight Kaliniyus. The eagle saw not
<lb/>Its battlements, a full moat girdled it,
<lb/>And all around it stretched a fair domain
<lb/>Of halls and gardens, grounds and palaces.
<lb/>'Twas strongly garrisoned by Roman troops—
<lb/>All famous men and eager for the fight.
<lb/>The Shah encamped his powers two leagues away,
<lb/>Earth blackened with the dust-clouds of the host,
<lb/>And war-cries went up from Kaliniyus—
<lb/>A clamour that bedwarfed the tymbals’ din.
<lb/>The Shah marked well that city whereunto
<lb/>His troops for ever thronged increasingly;
<lb/>They battled at the gates and showered down
<lb/>Their shafts and hand-grenades, and when bright Sol
<lb/>"Gan pale, and half revolving heaven was dark,
<lb/>No portion of the castle-walls remained:
<lb/>That city was all level with the ground.
<lb/>Then from the Shah's gate proclamation issued:—
<lb/>"Ye famous men of the Iranian host!
<lb/>Come from the city, every man, and pass
<lb/>The night upon the plain. If any cry
<lb/>Shall rise from women and from aged folk,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>Or any sound of pillage, rioting,
<lb/>And combating, shall reach mine ears at nights
<lb/>So that but one complain of evil usage,
<lb/>As soon as such appealeth ye shall see
<lb/>The skin of the offender stuffed with hay."<note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 359.</note>
<lb/>When Sol was stretching out its hand from Cancer,
<lb/>Had put away fatigue and banished sleep,
<lb/>The tymbals sounded at the monarch's gate,
<lb/>Those that were highest in esteem set forth,

<milestone unit="calced" n="1643"/>
<lb/>And from that hold and seat the men and women
<lb/>Assembled at the gate of Nushirwan:

<pb n="258"/>
<lb/>"No cavalier of all our warriors
<lb/>Is left," they said, "or magnate in this city;
<lb/>They all, though guiltless, have been slain or wounded
<lb/>And it is time for pardon from the Shah,
<lb/>Because God's justice never will approve
<lb/>That women, babes, and elders should be captive.
<lb/>The citadel and city's walls are such
<lb/>That henceforth thou wilt see but thorn-brakes here.
<lb/>Since Caesar was the offender how are we—
<lb/>The people of Kaliniyus—to blame?"
<lb/>The Shah gave pardon to those Romans: both
<lb/>The guilty and the innocent escaped.
<lb/>He left with them an ample store of wealth,
<lb/>And marched his army with all speed away;
<lb/>But all the folk that he saw fit for arms
<lb/>They bound on elephants and carried off.
<lb/>Then news to Antakiya came: "The Shah
<lb/>Is on his way with elephants and troops."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now at that city was a boundless host
<lb/>Of Roman warriors and mighty men.
<lb/>The Shah accorded to them three days’ grace
<lb/>That he might war not on them wrongfully,
<lb/>But on the fourth his host came mountain-like—
<lb/>The warriors of Iran in close array—
<lb/>While for the sake of women, children, land,
<lb/>And wealth the cavaliers of Rome advanced.
<lb/>They fought three mighty battles in three days,
<lb/>But on the fourth day when the sun arose
<lb/>The marches of that prosperous land lay open,
<lb/>The Iranians saw no Roman cavaliers,
<lb/>The soldiers took possession of the place,
<lb/>And filled it till there was no room to stand.
<lb/>The great men that had thrones and coronets,
<lb/>And those that were the treasurers of Caesar,
<lb/>Gave up the treasure to the Shah—the world-lord—
<lb/>The treasure unto him that bare the toil.
<pb n="259"/>
<lb/>The Iranians set in bonds on elephants
<lb/>All that were warriors among that folk.
<lb/>The Shah dispatched to Madain the captives,
<lb/>And all the wealth of Caesar, then went round
<lb/>The city and beheld a countryside
<lb/>More brilliant than the orbéd moon. The gardens,
<lb/>The parks, and streams, restored old age to freshness
<lb/>And youth. The king addressed his nobles thus:—
<lb/>“Can this be Antakiya or young spring?
<lb/>Whoe’er hath seen not jocund Paradise
<lb/>Whereof the soil is musk, the bricks are gold,
<lb/>Whose waters are rose-water and trees jewels,
<lb/>Whose country is the sky, whose heaven the sun,
<lb/>Should look on this fresh land, and may it be—
<lb/>This land of Rome—in full prosperity.”

How Nushirwan built the City of Zib-i-Khusrau in the Likeness
of Antakiya and settled the Roman Captives therein</head>

<milestone unit="calced" n="1644"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then Nushirwan gave orders to construct
<lb/>A city having palaces and streams,
<lb/>Like Antakiya, radiant as a lamp—
<lb/>All rosaries and mansions, parks and gardens.
<lb/>The great men, bright of heart and happy, called it
<lb/>Zib-i-Khusrau.<note>The Ornament of Khusrau.</note> "Twas like the jocund spring—
<lb/>A paradise all colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The captives taken in the towns of Rome,
<lb/>Whose hands and feet were galled with heavy bonds,
<lb/>Were set at large by Nushirwan’s command,
<lb/>And sent to dwell in joy in that new city.
<lb/>He said: “We have erected this new seat—
<lb/>All gardens, rosaries, and palaces—
<pb n="260"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1645"/>
<lb/>That each might have a dwelling to his mind
<lb/>And worthy of his name.”
</p>

<p>He gave to each
<lb/>Goods, and the earth was decked like Paradise.
<lb/>At sight of all the mansions, streets, and marts
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: “Each space is occupied.”
<lb/>A clamorous cordwainer came and said:—
<lb/>“O unjust Shah! there was a mulberry
<lb/>Within my dwelling at Kaliniyus
<lb/>Before my courtyard; from Zib-i-Khusrau
<lb/>I have not any such advantages,
<lb/>For there is no such tree before my door.”
</p>

<p>So Nushirwan bade men to plant green trees
<lb/>Before the door of that misfortuned one.
<lb/>The Shah then chose a Christian unto whom
<lb/>He gave authority, wealth, troops, and said:—
<lb/>"Zib-i-Khusrau is thine and thine the charge
<lb/>Of all the stranger-folk and their new home.
<lb/>Be like a tree that beareth fruit and be
<lb/>The city’s sire at whiles, at whiles its son.
<lb/>Be bountiful and beautify the place,
<lb/>Not covetous, and keep the mean in all.”
</p>

<p>The Shah marched forth from Antakiya, leaving
<lb/>A Christian and experienced man in charge.
<lb/>Farfuriyus thereafter brought to Caesar
<lb/>Intelligence about Kaliniyus,
<lb/>And said to him: “The experienced Nushirwan
<lb/>Came in his state with troops and elephants.
<lb/>So mighty is his host that seas and mountains
<lb/>Are all confounded by the horses’ dust.”
<lb/>Then Caesar writhed for that which he had spoken,
<lb/>And called to him his prudent chiefs. His heart
<lb/>Was full of fear because of Nushirwan;
<lb/>All day and through three watches of the night
<lb/>He canvassed what to do. Thus spake a priest:—
<milestone unit="calced" n="1645"/>
<lb/>"Thou’rt ill-advised because thou hast not power
<pb n="261"/>
<lb/>To fight with Nushirwan. The foe will raise
<lb/>The dust from this fair realm and bring to naught
<lb/>The achievements of the Caesars. In debate
<lb/>The feeble-tongued endangereth the state.”
</p>


</div>

<div>

<head>§ 15
How Caesar wrote to Nushirwan and sent Tribute</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now Caesar heard this and his heart was troubled,
<lb/>His counsels were o’ercast by Nushirwan.
<lb/>He chose of the philosophers of Rome
<lb/>From regions scathless of the enemy,
<lb/>A man of eloquence and understanding,
<lb/>While of the priests three score unsmirched in soul
<lb/>And wisdom volunteered. He sent the Shah
<lb/>An embassage. Those magnates took their way.
<lb/>Their leader was that man of wits, Mihras—
<lb/>A warrior old in wisdom, young in years.
<lb/>There went before them treasures of all kinds
<lb/>Past reckoning, while Caesar, who repented
<lb/>His language in the past, dispatched no stint
<lb/>Of adulation, counsels, and fair words,
<lb/>With heavy tribute and with hostages
<lb/>Both of his own and of his nobles’ kin.
<lb/>Mihras, when he had come to Nushirwan,
<lb/>Pronounced his praises in the Roman tongue,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: “So shrewd and just is he,
<lb/>He will produce stars from his sleeves!” 'Twas thus
<lb/>He spake to Nushirwan: “Set not, O king!
<lb/>Such value on the world. Thou art in Rome
<lb/>Now and Iran is void; it hath not worth
<lb/>Or glory. So, when Caesar is away
<lb/>From Rome, this country valueth not one gnat.
<lb/>The worth deriveth wholly from the man;
<lb/>When he is lost the value is lost too.
<pb n="262"/>
<lb/>If this commotion be but for wealth’s sake—
<lb/>That ruiner of wisdom and contentment—
<lb/>Lo! I have brought thee all the wealth of Rome,
<lb/>For more than land and treasure is a soul
<lb/>Serene.”’
<lb/>The king’s heart, when he heard this, grew
<lb/>As jocund as a garden in the spring,
<lb/>And he accepted what the envoy brought—
<lb/>The purses of gold coin, and hostages—
<lb/>Gave commendations to the ambassadors,
<lb/>Enlarging on the value of the gifts,
<lb/>And said: “O clear in wisdom! any one
<lb/>Whom wisdom feedeth is a mighty man.
<lb/>If all the soil of Rome were turned to gold
<lb/>Thou wouldst outvalue still that noble land.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They set as tribute on those fields and fells
<lb/>A hundred ox-hides brimming with dinars
<milestone unit="calced" n="1646"/>
<lb/>To be dispatched by Caesar to the king
<lb/>Each year with other gifts and offerings.
<lb/>His troops were not to occupy Yemen,
<lb/>Or to require aught of the people there.
<lb/>Therewith was heard the blare of trump and clash
<lb/>Of brazen cymbals, and the prudent world-lord
<lb/>Led back his host. He went his way to Sham,
<lb/>And tarried there awhile. He brought with him
<lb/>So many implements of war and troops,
<lb/>So many captives, purses, crowns, and thrones,
<lb/>That earth’s back bent beneath the elephants,
<lb/>And purses full of drachms. When he resolved
<lb/>To quit that land he set in charge thereof
<lb/>Shirwi, son of Bahram, and said: “Demand
<lb/>The tribute due from Caesar and accord not
<lb/>Remission for a month or day.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Shirwi,
<lb/>Who kissed the ground, blessed and addressed the Shah:—
<lb/>“Mayst thou be happy and victorious,
<lb/>And may the royal Tree ne’er pale its leaves.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When at the monarch’s portal had begun
<lb/>The drum-roll flag and troops fared toward Arman.

The Birth of Nushzad, the Son of Nishirwan, by a
Woman who was a Christian</head>
<p>
<lb/>Like to the sun was Nishirwan, the king—
<lb/>The world’s hope and its fear. Just as above
<lb/>Sol speedeth on its pathway carrying
<lb/>A sword in this hand and in that hand love,
<lb/>Is all relentless in its hour of rage,
<lb/>But in its day of ruth all clemency,
<lb/>So was this Shah of royal lineage,
<lb/>Who had adorned the world with equity.
<lb/>Know this—in my regard the monarch’s state
<lb/>And subject’s, if they holy be and pure,
<lb/>Requireth of necessity a mate,
<lb/>Dress, provand, and a privacy secure;
<lb/>While if the wife be pious and discreet
<lb/>A heaped-up treasure will she prove, and all
<lb/>The more if locks musk-scented to her feet
<lb/>Descend, and she be more than common tall,
<lb/>Wise, learned, well counselled, chaste, and can express
<lb/>Herself in fair discourse with gentleness.
<lb/>The noble Shah possessed a wife like this,
<lb/>In height a cypress and in looks a moon,
<lb/>This Moon-face was a Christian, and her beauty
<lb/>Engrossed the tongues of all. She bare a babe
<lb/>Sun-faced, out-shining Venus in the sky.
<lb/>The noble mother called the child Nashzad,
<lb/>And no fierce blast assailed that lovely boy.
<pb n="264"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1647"/>
<lb/>He grew up as he were a straight-stemmed cypress—
<lb/>A youth of parts, the glory of the realm.
<lb/>He knew of Hell, the path to Paradise,
<lb/>Of Christ, of Esdras, and Zarduhsht, but he,
<lb/>Believing not the Zandavasta, bathed
<lb/>His visage in the fount of Christ, preferring
<lb/>His mother’s to his father’s Faith: the age
<lb/>Was lost in wonderment at him. The king
<lb/>Was grievously concerned about his son,
<lb/>Because that Rose bare only fruit of thorns.
<lb/>They shut the portal of Nashzad’s fair palace,
<lb/>And there imprisoned him. His prison-house
<lb/>Was at Gund-i-Shapir<note>Kand-i-Shapir in the text. For this city see p. 219.</note> far from his home
<lb/>And father. Many criminals and captives
<lb/>Were with him in that city and in ward.
<lb/>Now when the Shah was on his way from Rome
<lb/>The turmoil and the journey tried him sorely;
<lb/>So weak was he that he could hold no court.
<lb/>One bare the tidings to Nushzad and told him:—
<lb/>"The Glory of the empire is bedimmed;
<lb/>The watchful world-lord Nishirwan is dead,
<lb/>Bequeathing to another earth and time."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>His father’s death rejoiced Nushzad. Oh! may
<lb/>No pleasure and enjoyment e’er be his!
<lb/>He that doth joy when just kings pass away
<lb/>Must have a gloomy temper. As to this
<lb/>A famous ancient said: "If thou art glad
<lb/>At my decease see that thou never die."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>From death thou know’st no succour can be had,
<lb/>The past is one here with futurity;
<lb/>But never death will wreck the soul of one
<lb/>Whose toil hath favour in the sight of God.
<lb/>Call we a reprobate and fool that son
<lb/>Who in his father’s footsteps hath not trod.
<lb/>Wet be the seed of colocynth or dry
<pb n="265"/>
<lb/>It will not savour musk, then where the need
<lb/>That it should change from what should spring thereby
<lb/>By nature if the gardener sow its seed?
<lb/>When any plant is predisposed to earth,
<lb/>It parteth with the sunshine and pure air,
<lb/>Therefrom no foliage or fruit hath birth,
<lb/>It liveth for the earth and dieth there.
</p>

<head>§ 17
The Sickness of Nushirwan and the Sedition of Nushzad</head>
<p>
<lb/>I have made mention of Nushzad. Take heed
<lb/>That thou quit not the path of equity.
<lb/>If heaven possessed a father then indeed
<lb/>He would resemble Nushirwan, so why
<lb/>Should his own son quit the paternal way,
<lb/>And seek the royal dignity and throne?
<milestone unit="calced" n="1648"/>
<lb/>Accord thine ear to all that I shall say,
<lb/>And I will keep back nothing, O my son!
<lb/>I have well ordered that I did receive
<lb/>From rustic bard, and by that token too
<lb/>Am fain some memory of myself to leave,
<lb/>So be the honour unto whom 'tis due.
<lb/>This is my wish that after I am dead
<lb/>My fame as poet evermore shall last.
<lb/>On this wise spake a Persian bard whose head
<lb/>A hundred years and twenty had o'erpast:—
<lb/>"He that is hostile to the world's great king
<lb/>Not of man's stock but Ahriman's must be."
</p>

<p>Now of Nushzad they tell that very thing
<lb/>As handed down by ancient legendry.
<lb/>Whenas the son of Nishirwan had heard:—
<lb/>"The throne of that right royal Tree is void,"
<pb n="266"/>
<lb/>He oped his palace-door, and from all quarters
<lb/>Troops gathered unto him—all that had 'scaped
<lb/>From wisdom's bonds and had been put in ward
<lb/>By Nushirwan. Nushzad unchained the mad,
<lb/>And all the city was in consternation;
<lb/>But he assembled of the citizens
<lb/>All that were Christians, whether priests or prelates,
<lb/>Assembled many haughty cavaliers
<lb/>And swordsmen, while his mother gave him wealth—
<lb/>The treasures lavished on her by the Shah.
<lb/>There gathered to him thirty thousand men,
<lb/>All famous and prepared to fight. He took
<lb/>The cities round; his fame was noised abroad.
<lb/>He wrote a letter to his kinsman<note>In the Faith. Cf. p. 269.</note> Caesar,
<lb/>Made known his dark designs, and said: "Arise
<lb/>O king! for thou art lord, friend, of one Faith
<lb/>With me, and Caesar. As it were Rome, Iran,
<lb/>Its worship and its settlements, are thine,
<lb/>My father hath been sick and now is dead,
<lb/>His wakeful fortune hath been overthrown."
</p>

<p>The tidings reached the towns of Madain
<lb/>Of what the son of Nushirwan had done,
<lb/>Whereat the warden of that march dispatched
<lb/>To Nushirwan a cavalier to whom
<lb/>He told what he had heard and what was secret.
<lb/>The messenger went like a rapid stream,
<lb/>And came to Nushirwan to whom he gave
<lb/>The letter, telling all that he had heard,
<lb/>And of the overt actions of Nushzad.
<lb/>The Shah, when he had listened and had read
<lb/>The letter, grieved thereat and was confounded,
<lb/>Held session with the noble archimages,
<lb/>Debating much with them in privacy,
<lb/>And, when the consultation reached its end
<lb/>In resolution, bade a scribe attend.

<head>§ 18
The Letter of Nushirwan to Ram Barzin, the Warden of the
March of Madain, respecting the Taking of Nushzad</head>
<p>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1649"/>
<lb/>The Shah, both seared and sore, with frowning face 
<lb/>And sighing lips, then had this letter written
<lb/>Wherein he first of all gave praise to Him,
<lb/>Who fashioned the heavens, time, and earth,
<lb/>The Artificer of Sun and Moon and Saturn,
<lb/>The Illuminer of Grace, of crown, and throne:—
<lb/>“From worthless stubble up to elephant
<lb/>And lion, from the dust on emmet’s foot
<lb/>Up to the Nile, though men shall roam from earth
<lb/>To turning heaven they roam beneath God’s sway.
<lb/>No limit can be seen to His behest,
<lb/>And none will rob Him of the sovereignty.
<lb/>Of that unpleasing letter have I heard,
<lb/>Sent by that most injurious son of mine,
<lb/>And of the criminals who broke from ward,
<lb/>And are assembled now about Nushzad.
<lb/>"Twere better one should quit the world than see
<lb/>A day like this, for all are born to die;
<lb/>First Nishirwan and then Nushzad must go.
<lb/>From gnat and ant e’en to rhinoceros
<lb/>And elephant, none can escape the claws
<lb/>And beak of death. If earth revealed its secrets,
<lb/>Displaying everything from first to last,
<lb/>Its bosom would be found fulfilled with kings,
<lb/>Its breast with blood of cavaliers, its skirts
<lb/>With men of lore, the creases of its robe
<lb/>With fair-cheeked dames. Then wherefore set a crown
<lb/>Or helmet on thy head when death’s plumed shaft
<lb/>Will pierce them both? No one rejoiceth much
<lb/>At death of son, albeit all must die;
<lb/>But as for those consorting with Nushzad,
<pb n="268"/>
<lb/>Who reckon on the death of Nishirwan,
<lb/>The death of them would be a cause for joy
<lb/>If but Nushzad should ‘scape the evil day.
<lb/>Moreover none but misbegotten knaves
<lb/>Would count upon the death of righteous Shahs.
<lb/>Now though Nushzad hath turned his head from us,
<lb/>In that the Div thus hath conspired with him,
<lb/>His purpose is not firm in this regard;
<lb/>He was inflamed when he obtained his wish.
<lb/>He could not have the post as well as we,
<lb/>And thus was ruined by a false report,
<lb/>For had the crown been void of Nishirwan
<lb/>Nushzad had been the glory of the realm.
<lb/>Still such an act is worthy of his Faith,
<lb/>And suited to an evil soul like his.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1650"/>
<lb/>I am not moved or fearful in this matter,
<lb/>In that our son’s religion is impure;
<lb/>Moreover, for the wealth that he hath wrecked,
<lb/>That matter weigheth nothing on my heart;
<lb/>While as for all that have combined with him,
<lb/>And banished from their hearts their awe of us—
<lb/>The ill-doers, the malignant, and base-born,
<lb/>Unworthy to be subjects to myself—
<lb/>We look upon them also with contempt:
<lb/>Let not their doings make thy heart afraid.
<lb/>My fear is of the Master of the world,
<lb/>Who is in wisdom wiser than the wise.
<lb/>We must not grow unthankful in our souls
<lb/>To God who is omniscient in good.
<lb/>Me hath He given triumph and success,
<lb/>Grace and the diadem of king of kings,
<lb/>And had my praise been worthy of His gifts
<lb/>It would have bettered my prosperity.
<lb/>My son hath found a home and rest elsewhere;
<lb/>No single drop of him came from my loins.
<lb/>With his awakening my foe arrived,
<pb n="269"/>
<lb/>And, I do fear me, toil. Still if the World-lord
<lb/>Hath no occasion to be wroth with me
<lb/>I reck not of such things. In my regard
<lb/>All they that are confederate with my son
<lb/>Are vile and despicable. 'Tis his letter
<lb/>That, if it bringeth Caesar, will befoul
<lb/>My stream. The twain must be akin, methinketh,
<lb/>Since they are one in Faith and policy.
<lb/>The man that quitteth his forefathers’ Faith
<lb/>Is one whose wits are much to seek. That son
<lb/>Is best who is of one Faith, not at war,
<lb/>With his own sire. Albeit though that insensate
<lb/>Turn from the right no lip must ope to curse him.
<lb/>To curse him is in essence to curse us,
<lb/>Because he is of our own flesh and blood.
<lb/>Array the host, take order for the war,
<lb/>But act with moderation and hold back,
<lb/>While if the matter cometh to a pass,
<lb/>And if he offer battle, be not fierce.
<lb/>To capture him is better than to slay:
<lb/>Perchance he will turn back from evil doing,
<lb/>And then the stream that reared that noble Cypress
<lb/>Must come not on it in a bath of dust;
<lb/>But if he hold his honoured person cheaply,
<lb/>If that tall Cypress shall demean itself,
<lb/>And if he spurn the pillow of delight,
<lb/>Withhold not thou the mace and scimitar.
<lb/>A man of rank indulging base desires
<lb/>Cannot be freed from that propensity,
<lb/>And such a high-born man is base indeed
<lb/>When he doth fight the monarch of the world.
<lb/>Fear not to slay him if he would pour out
<lb/>His own head’s blood upon the dust. He hasteth
<milestone unit="calced" n="1651"/>
<lb/>To give his faith to Caesar and put off
<lb/>Allegiance to our crown, whereby his greatness
<lb/>Hath grown vile, wretched, and calamitous,
<pb n="270"/>
<lb/>And he hath chosen ruin from high heaven.
<lb/>In this regard said Mihr-i-Nush—a sage
<lb/>Who worshipped God and wore the woollen vest:—
<lb/>‘The man that joyeth in a father’s death,
<lb/>May his be neither happiness nor breath.’
<lb/>Seek not for light from darkness, else wilt thou
<lb/>But mingle fire and water in the stream.
<lb/>Man’s only rest is when his toil is done:
<lb/>It is fate’s law and we must acquiesce.
<lb/>Be not in friendship with the turning sky,
<lb/>For whiles thou art the kernel, whiles the shell.
<lb/>Why seek from its pomegranate hue and scent,
<lb/>For it will rob thee of them both at sight?
<lb/>Whene’er the turning sky exalteth thee,
<lb/>Then is thy time for travail, fear, and loss.
<lb/>As for the soldiers that are with Nushzad,
<lb/>And err so greatly from the path of duty,
<lb/>Know that they are but wind and sport to us,
<lb/>The mockery of the wise, no mystery.
<lb/>As for the Christians that are in his host,
<lb/>And have revolted for religion’s sake,
<lb/>The regimen of Christ is such that they
<lb/>Are frighted if one lifteth up one’s voice,
<lb/>Desert his precepts and his path, and end
<lb/>By turning into foemen of the Cross.
<lb/>As for the other folk—the common herd,
<lb/>Ill-taught, ill-minded, and adventurous—
<lb/>They will not fright the heart of any man:
<lb/>Their counsel and a breath of air are one.
<lb/>Now if Nushzad be taken in the fight,
<lb/>Discourse not with him touching these affairs;
<lb/>His person must not suffer injury,
<lb/>His raiment must not show the rents of blows,
<lb/>Because his women-folk will slay themselves.
<lb/>His palace will afford the best of prisons
<pb n="271"/>
<lb/>Both for himself and those that follow him.
<lb/>Bar not to him the portal of my treasures,
<lb/>Albeit one so dear hath grown so vile,
<lb/>And as for raiment, victuals, tapestries,
<lb/>And carpets there must be no stint at all,
<lb/>For he is fitted but for things like these.
<lb/>As for those matchlords of the Iranians—
<lb/>Those that have girded up their loins with him—
<lb/>When thou hast conquered do not hesitate,
<lb/>But cleave them through the middle with the sword,
<lb/>For all that are the great king’s enemies
<lb/>Thou rightly flingest to the crocodiles.
<lb/>Besides these, all that are opposed to me
<lb/>At heart—the seed of wicked Ahriman—
<lb/>Who have forgotten all our benefits,
<lb/>Thou now wilt test in dealing with Nushzad.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1652"/>
<lb/>All acted as our watchmen heretofore,
<lb/>And were in terror of our punishments.
<lb/>For those on-lookers who have vilified,
<lb/>And wagged their tongues against, Nushzad, know thou
<lb/>That they have in especial cursed ourselves,
<lb/>Preparing trouble in mine evil day.
<lb/>Do not thou too as they; thus foemen speak.
<lb/>Unworthy as he is he is mine own,
<lb/>Such is the truthful witness of my heart.
<lb/>The tongue of each man that hath spoken ill,
<lb/>Or acted with injustice toward him, brand
<lb/>In presence of the folk. May such an one
<lb/>Have neither tongue nor mouth. As for the man
<lb/>That warreth to overthrow the Shah, employing
<lb/>Guile, enmity, hostility, and faith
<lb/>In Ahriman, such, as the famed Shah’s foe,
<lb/>Must not be suffered in the realm.”
</p>

<p>They set
<lb/>The Shah’s own seal upon the letter. Then
<lb/>The messenger departed with all speed,
<pb n="272"/>
<lb/>And, when to Ram Barzin he made his way,
<lb/>Told all that he had heard the great king say.

How Ram Barzin fought with Nushzad, and how Nushzad
was slain</head>
<p>
<lb/>That done, he gave to Ram Barzin the letter
<lb/>With its behests for dealing with Nushzad,
<lb/>To levy troops, make war, and banish ruth.
<lb/>When the old man had read it, and had heard
<lb/>The messenger at large, the din of tymbals
<lb/>Arose at cock-crow at the palace-portal,
<lb/>A mighty host marched forth from Madain,
<lb/>And Ram Barzin went swiftly to the war.
<lb/>News reached Nushzad who called and paid his host,
<lb/>While all the Christians and grandees of Rum
<lb/>That dwelt along the march of that fair land
<lb/>Assembled with Shammas as general:
<lb/>Those warriors' hands all had been bathed in blood.
<lb/>A shout rose from the portal of Nushzad,
<lb/>And then the army, like a wind-tossed sea,
<lb/>Moved from the city out upon the plain,
<lb/>Their heads all war, their hearts revenge and venom.
<lb/>When Ram Barzin beheld that army's dust
<lb/>He blew the trumpets and arrayed the host.
<lb/>The dust of cavaliers, the charge of chieftains,
<lb/>The brandishing of mighty maces, rent
<lb/>The hearts of flints; none saw the bright sun's face.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1653"/>
<lb/>Then in the centre of the host Nushzad
<lb/>Set on his head a Rum helm. His host
<lb/>Was full of Christian clericals from Rum;
<lb/>The soil was hidden by their horses' hoofs.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: "Earth seetheth, and the air
<lb/>Is shrieking over it."
<lb/>A warrior,
<pb n="273"/>
<lb/>Beclad in mail and hight Piruz the old,
<lb/>Came boldly forth and cried: "O famed Nushzad!
<lb/>Who wantonly hath turned thy head from right?
<lb/>Contend not with the army of the king
<lb/>Because thou wilt repent thee of this strife.
<lb/>Thou hast abjured the Faith of Gayomart,
<lb/>The pathway of Hushang and Tahmuras.
<lb/>The arch-deceiver Christ was put to death
<lb/>Because he had renounced the Faith of God;
<lb/>So choose not him, of all that founded Faiths,
<lb/>Who so mistook the aspect of his work,
<lb/>For if the Grace of God had shone in him
<lb/>How could the Jews have gained the upper hand?
<lb/>Heard hast thou what thy sire, that noble man,
<lb/>The world-lord, did to Caesar and to Rum,
<lb/>Yet now thou wouldst contend with him and raise
<lb/>Thy head to heaven! For all thy moon-like mien,
<lb/>Thy Grace and stature, neck, limbs, hands, and mace,
<lb/>I see no wisdom with thee anywhere,
<lb/>Such recklessness possesseth thy dark soul!
<lb/>Woe for this head of thine, crown, name, and birth,
<lb/>Which now thou wouldst abandon to the blast!
<lb/>For son to seek his living father's throne,
<lb/>How should this be? 'Tis neither use nor right.
<lb/>To seek the crown, if he be dead, is well;
<lb/>To seek to fight him now is criminal.
<lb/>Save thou be snorting elephant or lion
<lb/>Thou canst not match Shah Nishirwan, and though
<lb/>I have not seen, O prince! a bridle-hand
<lb/>Like thine limned in the palace of the Shahs,
<lb/>Such foot and stirrups, such a breast and neck,
<lb/>Such ardour in the fight and such a mace,
<lb/>Though painter never looked on such a picture,
<lb/>Or any age on such a prince, yet burn not
<lb/>The soul of Nishirwan by childishness,
<pb n="274"/>
<lb/>Or stultify the world-illuming crown,
<lb/>For hostile howsoever a son may be
<lb/>His father will lament when he is slain.
<lb/>Dismount, ask quarter of the Shah, and fling
<lb/>This mace and Rum helmet to the ground;
<lb/>Then if far hence some chilling blast should make
<lb/>The dark dust settle on thy countenance,
<lb/>The Shah's heart would consume for thee, the sun
<lb/>Weep o'er thy face. Sow not throughout the world
<lb/>The seed of enmity, for hastiness
<lb/>Becometh not a prince. If thou dost swerve
<lb/>From mine advice and trust to violence,
<lb/>And to thy might, the counsel of Piruz
<milestone unit="calced" n="1654"/>
<lb/>Oft will recur to thee, and then the words
<lb/>Of thine ill counsellors will seem but wind."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Nushzad made answer: "O wind-pated dotard!
<lb/>Ask not my troops—exalted warriors—
<lb/>Or me—the Shah's son—to cry out for quarter.
<lb/>The Faith of Nushirwan is naught to me;
<lb/>My heart inclineth to my mother—her
<lb/>Whose constant practice is the Faith of Christ.
<lb/>I will not quit her Grace and Faith. Although
<lb/>Its Founder—Christ—was slain, the World-lord's Grace
<lb/>Hath not forsaken Him. That Holy One
<lb/>Hath passed from this earth back to holy God,
<lb/>Such was His aspiration when on earth.
<lb/>I may be slain but shall not fear to die,
<lb/>For to that bane there is no antidote."

<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: "Earth seetheth, and the air
<lb/>Is shrieking over it."
<lb/>A warrior,
<pb n="273"/>
<lb/>Beclad in mail and hight Piruz the old,
<lb/>Came boldly forth and cried: "O famed Nushzad!
<lb/>Who wantonly hath turned thy head from right?
<lb/>Contend not with the army of the king
<lb/>Because thou wilt repent thee of this strife.
<lb/>Thou hast abjured the Faith of Gayomart,
<lb/>The pathway of Hushang and Tahmuras.
<lb/>The arch-deceiver Christ was put to death
<lb/>Because he had renounced the Faith of God;
<lb/>So choose not him, of all that founded Faiths,
<lb/>Who so mistook the aspect of his work,
<lb/>For if the Grace of God had shone in him
<lb/>How could the Jews have gained the upper hand?
<lb/>Heard hast thou what thy sire, that noble man,
<lb/>The world-lord, did to Caesar and to Rum,
<lb/>Yet now thou wouldst contend with him and raise
<lb/>Thy head to heaven! For all thy moon-like mien,
<lb/>Thy Grace and stature, neck, limbs, hands, and mace,
<lb/>I see no wisdom with thee anywhere,
<lb/>Such recklessness possesseth thy dark soul!
<lb/>Woe for this head of thine, crown, name, and birth,
<lb/>Which now thou wouldst abandon to the blast!
<lb/>For son to seek his living father's throne,
<lb/>How should this be? 'Tis neither use nor right.
<lb/>To seek the crown, if he be dead, is well;
<lb/>To seek to fight him now is criminal.
<lb/>Save thou be snorting elephant or lion
<lb/>Thou canst not match Shah Nishirwan, and though
<lb/>I have not seen, O prince! a bridle-hand
<lb/>Like thine limned in the palace of the Shahs,
<lb/>Such foot and stirrups, such a breast and neck,
<lb/>Such ardour in the fight and such a mace,
<lb/>Though painter never looked on such a picture,
<lb/>Or any age on such a prince, yet burn not
<lb/>The soul of Nishirwan by childishness,
<pb n="274"/>
<lb/>Or stultify the world-illuming crown,
<lb/>For hostile howsoever a son may be
<lb/>His father will lament when he is slain.
<lb/>Dismount, ask quarter of the Shah, and fling
<lb/>This mace and Rum helmet to the ground;
<lb/>Then if far hence some chilling blast should make
<lb/>The dark dust settle on thy countenance,
<lb/>The Shah's heart would consume for thee, the sun
<lb/>Weep o'er thy face. Sow not throughout the world
<lb/>The seed of enmity, for hastiness
<lb/>Becometh not a prince. If thou dost swerve
<lb/>From mine advice and trust to violence,
<lb/>And to thy might, the counsel of Piruz
<milestone unit="calced" n="1654"/>
<lb/>Oft will recur to thee, and then the words
<lb/>Of thine ill counsellors will seem but wind."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Nushzad made answer: "O wind-pated dotard!
<lb/>Ask not my troops—exalted warriors—
<lb/>Or me—the Shah's son—to cry out for quarter.
<lb/>The Faith of Nushirwan is naught to me;
<lb/>My heart inclineth to my mother—her
<lb/>Whose constant practice is the Faith of Christ.
<lb/>I will not quit her Grace and Faith. Although
<lb/>Its Founder—Christ—was slain, the World-lord's Grace
<lb/>Hath not forsaken Him. That Holy One
<lb/>Hath passed from this earth back to holy God,
<lb/>Such was His aspiration when on earth.
<lb/>I may be slain but shall not fear to die,
<lb/>For to that bane there is no antidote."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He answered thus the old Piruz and veiled
<lb/>Air's face with shafts. The warriors of the host
<lb/>Advanced, the battle-cry and clarion's blare
<lb/>Went up, Nushzad, the chief, spurred on like fire,
<lb/>Came as it were Azargashasp, and broke
<lb/>The left wing of the army of the Shah,
<lb/>Where none remained to fight with him. He slew
<pb n="275"/>
<lb/>Full many a Lion of the host, whereat,
<lb/>Grown wrathful, Ram Barzin bade shower arrows,
<lb/>And fill the air as 'twere with hail in spring.
<lb/>The din of battle went up on both sides
<lb/>From all the valiant soldiers there engaged.
<lb/>Nushzad was wounded in the melee. Oft
<lb/>He called to mind the counsel of Piruz,
<lb/>And reached in pain the centre of the host,
<lb/>Pierced by a shaft and pale with agony.
<lb/>Thus said he to the warriors of Rum:—
<lb/>"To fight one's sire is wretched, vile, accursed!"
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bewailing and lamenting thus he summoned
<lb/>A bishop and confessed his heart's desires.
<lb/>He said: "The evil fortune caused by me
<lb/>Has fallen rigorously upon myself.
<lb/>Now, since my head will pass beneath the dust,
<lb/>Dispatch a horseman to my mother. Say
<lb/>To her: 'Nushzad hath left this world. For him
<lb/>The days of right and wrong are at an end.
<lb/>I prithee be not grieved at heart for me;
<lb/>Such is the fashion of this Wayside Inn!
<lb/>Since I have been allotted this dark day
<lb/>How could my heart be glad and brighten earth!
<lb/>All living creatures are but born to die;
<lb/>Grieve not for me, for thou art mortal too.
<lb/>'Tis not my slaying that confoundeth me,
<lb/>But worse—my sire's displeasure. Let me have
<lb/>No mausoleum, throne, or stately rites,
<lb/>But bury me with Christian burial.
<lb/>I need no camphor, musk, or spicery,
<lb/>For arrow-stricken I depart the world.'"
<milestone unit="calced" n="1655"/>
<lb/>He spake and shut his lips. Thus passed Nushzad,
<lb/>That noble Lion-heart. Now when his troops
<lb/>Heard of his death they fled the battlefield.
<lb/>The Iranian leader, hearing that the prince
<lb/>Was slain, went weeping to his couch in haste.
<pb n="276"/>
<lb/>The troops ceased slaying on the field of fight,
<lb/>And neither joyed nor spoiled. They saw the prince
<lb/>Slain and o'erthrown with ignominy, his head
<lb/>Upon a Rum bishop’s breast: the field
<lb/>Was filled with wailing for him. Ram Barzin
<lb/>Was troubled to the heart and asked the prelate:—
<lb/>"What know'st thou of the prince's dying wishes?"
<lb/>"Except his mother,” thus the bishop answered,
<lb/>"None must behold his head exposed. He, seeing
<lb/>That he was wounded by a shaft, forbade
<lb/>All obsequies and musk and spicery,
<lb/>Or coronet, brocade of Rum, and throne,
<lb/>Perceiving his to be the slave's dark lot.
<lb/>His mother now will shroud him and provide
<lb/>A tomb and winding-sheet with Christian rites,
<lb/>While his condition now is that of Christ's,
<lb/>Although he did not die upon the Cross."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Of all the Christians that were in the land
<lb/>There was not one but had his visage torn.
<lb/>A cry rose from the country. Men and women
<lb/>Assembled. From the plain they raised the corpse
<lb/>Of that young, gallant prince—the Heart and Eyes
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, the Shah—upon a bier,
<lb/>Transporting it three leagues by hand, then set it
<lb/>Upon two mules which bare it to his mother.
<lb/>Now when she was aware of what had chanced
<lb/>Her head and crown descended to the dust.
<lb/>She came forth to the street unveiled. A crowd
<lb/>Assembled round her in the market-place.
<lb/>They set a camp-enclosure round about,
<lb/>And all the folk cast dust upon their heads.
<lb/>They laid him in the earth. He passed. He came
<lb/>From wind and suddenly to wind returned.
<lb/>Gund-i-Shapur<note>See p. 219.</note> was all in tears, consumed
<lb/>With sorrow for the anguish of the Shah.
<lb/>Why writhe so madly in the bonds of greed?
<pb n="277"/>
<lb/>Thou know'st that here thou canst not long remain.
<lb/>Seek to escape, give not the world such heed,



<lb/>Smell not its rose so fondly, 'tis but bane.
<lb/>From Faith and righteousness turn not thy head,
<lb/>Or else the wrath of God will chasten thee;
<lb/>"A father’s wrath,” a pious Arab said,
<lb/>"Will bring upon thy life calamity.”
<lb/>When sire shall be displeased with son in aught
<lb/>Know that in seed and fruit that son is bad.
<lb/>Oh! never make thy father’s soul distraught
<lb/>Whatever trouble thou from him hast had.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1656"/>
<lb/>When thou’rt secure refrain thy heart from woe,
<lb/>Nor on thy heart the fire of trouble fling,
<lb/>Let not thy passions master wisdom so,
<lb/>But act with seemliness in everything.<note>Four couplets omitted.</note>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now be the world’s king happy all his days,
<lb/>And may he bear these words of mine in mind.
<lb/>Mahmud, the world-lord, who ensueth praise,
<lb/>A niche therefor in every heart will find.
<lb/>Love ever shineth from his Grace divine,
<lb/>His crown’s top is the pillar of the sky.
<lb/>Now ask, if cup thou hast, for amber wine,
<lb/>And hold not quaffing acting sinfully.
<lb/>Seek joy and mirth but never be bemused,
<lb/>Nor think that talk—wise talk—should be abused.

<div> <head>PART II: THE STORY OF BUZURJMIHR AND OF THE SEVEN BANQUETS OF NUSHIRWAN</head>
<pb n="278"/>

<argument>
<p> The Shah, being disquieted by a dream, sends emissaries through the empire to find an interpreter. One is discovered at Marv in the person of Buzurjmihr, then a youth, who having been brought before the Shah interprets the dream and is advanced to great honour. The Shah subsequently gives a series of entertainments at which discussions on wisdom and morals are substituted for the usual diversions of Oriental banquets, and Buzurjmihr again greatly distinguishes himself.
</p>
</argument>
<note>Persia, like other nations, has its Wisdom-literature. This comprises apologues, apothegms, proverbs, parables, the interpretation of dreams and dark sentences, astrological forecasts, the solution of problems, the supplying the correct answer to questions relating to religion, morals, conduct, and expediency, and longer discourses thereon, reflections on fate and fortune, on the uncertainty of all terrestrial affairs, on the vanity of striving after wealth and fame, and the importance of leaving behind one a good name after death. All these forms of wisdom find expression in the Shahnameh, and the poet himself has been not backward in contributing his quota. At the first available opportunity in his work he utters his “Praise of Wisdom”—the first created of God and His best gift to man.<note n="1">Vol. i. p. 101. Cf. too p. 103, supra.</note></note>

<p> A collection of all the passages dealing with such themes and subjects as are mentioned above, and including Firdausi’s own reflections on such matters, as have occurred in the poem up to this point, would amount to something considerable, but scattered through a mass of narrative they are apt to be overlooked. In this reign, however, we are confronted by formal collections of primitive Persian Wisdom associated for the most part with the name of Buzurjmihr but to some extent with other great officials and with <pb n="279"/> Nushirwan himself. Firdausi availed himself of the opportunity of the conjunction of the just Shah with the wise counsellor to bring together all that he could find in his authorities and elsewhere on some of the subjects mentioned at the beginning of this note. That a large Pahlavi literature once existed on such matters, and arranged sometimes in the form of question and answer, we know from what is extant. Thus the sage in the "<q>Din-i Mainog-i Khrad</q>" ("<q>Opinions of the Spirit of Wisdom</q>") consults the Spirit of Wisdom on sixtytwo points and receives answers, e.g. "<q>The sage asked the spirit of wisdom thus: 'Which man is the mightier?' ... The spirit of wisdom answered thus: 'That man is the mightier who is able to struggle with his own fiends; and, in particular, he who keeps these five fiends far from his person, which are such as greediness, wrath, lust, disgrace, and discontent.</q>"<note n="1">WPT, iii. 81.</note> The concluding question is: "<q>Which is that good work which is greater and better than all good works, and no trouble whatever is necessary for its performance?</q>" The answer is: "<q>To be grateful in the world, and to wish happiness for everyone. This is greater and better than every good work, and no commotion whatever is necessary for its performance.</q>"<note n="2">Id. 113.</note> These questions and answers are quite of a piece with the sages’ gnomes in the poem. There are also extant in Pahlavi the "<q>Pandnamak-i Vazurg-Mihr-i Bakhtagan</q>" or "<q>Bakhtagan,</q>" i.e. the "<q>Book of Counsels of Buzurjmihr the son of Bakhtagan,</q>" the "<q>Characteristics of a Happy Man,</q>" and other texts dealing with similar subjects.<note n="3">GIP, ii. 113 seq.</note> There can be no doubt but that Firdausi derived the sententious, gnomic, parenetic, or whatever one chooses to call them, portions of the Shahnama, like the narrative, indirectly from the Pahlavi. Four series of such passages occur in the present reign, The first and longest is in the present Part. The second is Buzurjmihr’s Discourse on good deeds and works in Part III. The third is Nushirwan’s answers to the questions addressed to him by the archmages. The fourth is the word-for-word examination that Hurmuzd, Nushirwan’s son, has to pass at the hands of Buzurjmihr, by order of the Shah, before being nominated as his father’s successor. One cannot help feeling a sneaking sympathy, reprehensible though it be, with him when we find him signalising his advent to the throne by making a clean sweep of his father’s ministers from whose “wise saws and modern instances” doubtlessly he had suffered much in the days of his youth. Nero acted similarly in the case of Burrus and the younger Seneca. Of these four series the third is concerned only partly with Wisdom-literature, some <pb n="280"/> of the questions dealing with Nushirwan’s own conduct on specified occasions. This and the fourth series will appear in Volume VIII, Buzurjmihr, the son of Bakhtagan, of Marv, the man chiefly associated with the Wisdom-literature of the Shahnama, is but a semi-historical figure hardly mentioned by any historian before Firdausi's time with the exception of Mas'udi who died when the poet was a youth. Mas'udi gives twelve maxims of Buzurjmihr’s and little else,<note n="4">MM, ii. 206 seg., vii. 164.</note> so that practically we are dependent on what Firdausi tells us, and this, with regard to the incidents recorded, generally has something of the preternatural about it. Buzurjmihr’s career begins with a dream, and while sleeping on his journey to the court a snake, which seems an Arab rather than a Persian touch, comes and breathes over him. Moreover, his fall from power is preceded by an omen and his restoration to favour accomplished by another. We never hear of him as being associated with any of Nushirwan’s great achievements in administration or in war. He is employed, it is true, upon two missions, once to expound a game—chess—and to propound another of his own invention—nard—and once to negotiate in time of war a loan for his master, which falls through owing to the fact that Nushirwan has a higher conception of the dignity of the office of the scribe than Buzurjmihr himself. His repute seems largely due to Firdausi, who used him as a peg whereon to hang all the old clothes of the Wisdom-literature that the poet was too conscientious to discard but could not dispose of elsewhere. There is, however, a thanksgiving couplet to testify that he was not sorry when the worst of his task was over.<note n="5">See p. 379.</note> If the number seven were not such a favourite in Persian story one might suggest that the Seven Banquets of Nushirwan originated in a perverted reminiscence of the seven Greek philosophers who were entertained for a while at his court when Justinian closed the schools of Athens,<note n="6">GDF, v. 93.</note> and that Buzurjmihr himself is not much more than a native composite reproduction of those hapless and disillusioned sages.
</p>
<div><head>§ 1 How Nushirwan had a Dream and how Buzurjmihr interpreted it</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now in the tale of Buzurjmihr will we
<lb/>Reveal a cheerier visage. Do not deem
<lb/>That there is naught but folly in a dream;
<lb/>Know that a dream may smack of prophecy,
<lb/>And in especial when such visitings
</p>
<pb n="282"/>
<p>
<lb/>Impress the clear mind of a king of kings.
<lb/>The stars with sky and moon hold conference,
<lb/>Their words are whispered and dispersed through space,
<lb/>And clear souls dreaming see the future thence
<lb/>As fire is mirrored in the water’s face.
<lb/>One night Shah Nushirwan, the wise and shrewd,
<lb/>That lucid spirit, lay asleep and dreamed:
<lb/>A royal tree grew up before the throne,
<lb/>And joyed his heart. He called for harp and wine
<lb/>And minstrelsy, but on his throne of peace
<lb/>And joy there sat with him a sharp-toothed boar,
<lb/>Sat ready-dight for revelry and claimed
<lb/>To quaff the wine from Nushirwan’s own cup.
<lb/>Sol rose in Taurus and the skylark’s note
<lb/>Was heard on all sides yet the monarch sat
<lb/>Upon his throne in dudgeon at that dream.
<lb/>They called the interpreter of dreams and held
<lb/>A session of the magnates at the court.
<lb/>The Shah narrated to those archimages,
<lb/>The counsellors, his dream. The interpreter
<milestone unit="calced" n="1657"/>
<lb/>Made no reply, he knew of no such case,
<lb/>And one that pleadeth ignorance is excused.
<lb/>The Shah, thus left unanswered by the sages,
<lb/>Was instant what to do in his concern,
<lb/>And sent to every side an archimage,
<lb/>One enterprising, shrewd of heart, and wise.
<lb/>He made each take a purse and entertained
<lb/>High hopes from their return. In every purse
<lb/>There were ten thousand drachms that every envoy
<lb/>Might seek out some interpreter of dreams,
<lb/>Some man of understanding, some adept,
<lb/>To solve the world-king’s dream and to reveal
<lb/>The mystery, and then bestow on such
<lb/>A full purse and the royal compliments.
<note>Reading with P.</note>
</p>
<pb n="283"/>
<p>
<lb/>So to all parts a veteran archmage went—
<lb/>A prudent cavalier and man of lore.
<lb/>One of these chiefs—Azad Sarv—came to Marv,
<lb/>Went through the town and saw an archimage,
<lb/>Who taught the Zandavasta to some youths
<lb/>With harshness, anger, and raised voice. The tallest,
<lb/>An earnest student of the Zandavasta,
<lb/>One whom they used to title Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Was poring lovingly upon the roll.
<lb/>Azad Sarv turned his rein, drew near, and sought
<lb/>An explanation of the great king’s dream.
<lb/>The scribe replied: "’Tis not my business;
<lb/>The Zandavasta is my help to knowledge.
<lb/>I teach these children but I do not dare
<lb/>To breathe of aught beyond," but Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Said blushing to his master, having heard
<lb/>The envoy’s words: "This quarry is for me;
<lb/>It is my business to interpret dreams."
<lb/>His teacher bawled: "Hast thou thy roll by heart
<lb/>That thou shouldst thus exalt thy neck in pride,
<lb/>And set up as a dream-interpreter?"
<lb/>The envoy said to him: "O learned man!
<lb/>He may possess this skill; abash him not.
<lb/>This youth’s lot may be high through fortune’s teaching,
<lb/>Not thine."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The master wroth with Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Cried: "Tell then what thou knowest," but he
<lb/>answered:
<lb/>"I will speak not till set before the Shah."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy gave him money and a steed
<lb/>With all things needful. They set off from Marv,
<lb/>As pheasants pace ‘neath roses, and discoursed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1658"/>
<lb/>About the Shah, his power, Grace, crown, and state
<lb/>Till at the hour for provand and repose
<lb/>They reached a spot with water, lighted down
<note>Cf. Vol. v. p. 260.</note>
</p>
<pb n="284"/>
<p>
<lb/>Beneath a tree and, having eaten, rested.
<lb/>While Buzurjmihr slept in the shade, his mantle
<lb/>Drawn o’er his face, his noble way-mate saw,
<lb/>Being still awake, a snake which drew away
<lb/>The mantle from the sleeper, vehemently
<lb/>Breathed over him from head to foot, then clomb
<lb/>The tree. When that black snake had scaled the stem
<lb/>The youth awoke, and when the serpent saw
<lb/>The youth’s discomfiture it disappeared
<lb/>Amid the dusky boughs. The envoy stood
<lb/>Astound, invoking oft the name of God,
<lb/>And thought: "This wise youth will attain to greatness!"
<lb/>They left that wood, pushed on, and reached the Shah.
<lb/>The envoy hurried first before the throne
<lb/>Of Nushirwan, and said: "Oh! may thy fortune
<lb/>Be ever young, O Shah! From court I went
<lb/>To Marv and roamed about as pheasant doth
<lb/>Within a rosary. Amid the sages
<lb/>I found a wise youth and have brought him hither
<lb/>In haste."
<lb/>He told withal what Buzurjmihr
<lb/>Had said and of the portent of the snake.
<lb/>The world-lord called and told the dream to him.
<lb/>He heard, grew full of matter, and replied:
<lb/>"There is a youth disguised in women’s garb
<lb/>Within thy bower. Now put all strangers forth,
<lb/>That none may know our purpose, and command
<lb/>Thy ladies all to pass before thy presence
<lb/>With measured tread, and then I will demand
<lb/>Of that bold reprobate how came he thus
<lb/>Within the Lion’s lair, for God will show
<lb/>The secret fact to be as thou hast dreamed."
<lb/>The Shah put forth all strangers, closed the palace
<lb/>Of king of kings, and bade the eunuchs bring,
</p>
<pb n="285"/>
<p>
<lb/>As swift as smoke, the Idols dwelling there.
<lb/>They came, those Idols of his bower, in all
<milestone unit="calced" n="1659"/>
<lb/>Their perfumes, tints, and beauty. All these fair ones,
<lb/>Exhaling jasmine, dainty, modest, passed
<lb/>With leisured tread before him, but no man
<lb/>Appeared among them, and like an angry lion
<lb/>Raged Nushirwan. Then said the interpreter:
<lb/>"This should not be; there is a youth among them.
<lb/>Bid them to pass a second time all bare,
<lb/>And probe their practice to the uttermost."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah spake thus: "Cause them to pass again,
<lb/>And put away the veil of modesty."
<lb/>They passed the second time and, when all thought
<lb/>The dream an empty one, a youth appeared
<lb/>Of cypress-stature and of kingly looks,
<lb/>But quaking like a willow and despairing
<lb/>Of his dear life. Now in the great king’s bower
<lb/>Were seventy girls, all noble Cypresses,
<lb/>And one of them, with cheeks of ivory,
<lb/>Was daughter to the governor of Chach.
<lb/>The youth with jasmine-face and musk-perfumed
<lb/>Had been her love at home. He followed her
<lb/>Where’er she went and served her like a slave.
<lb/>The Shah inquired of her: "Who is this man
<lb/>So cherished by my slave, so favored, young,
<lb/>And daring, in the bower of Nushirwan?"
<lb/>"He is not," said the girl, "as old as I.
<lb/>He is but young. One mother bore us both.
<lb/>Our sire was different, our mother one.
<lb/>There is naught wrong between us. He assumed
<lb/>This kind of habit, for through modesty
<lb/>He did not dare to look upon the Shah.
<lb/>Oh! make it not a pretext that my brother
<lb/>From shamefastness before thee veiled his face."
<lb/>The Shah said to the youth: "Thou worthless dog!
<lb/>Both race and family are smirched by thee."
</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>
<lb/>He frowned. He was amazed at that young pair,
<lb/>Then bade in wrath the executioner:
<lb/>"Let the dust hide them."
<lb/>So he haled them back
<lb/>Behind the curtains of Shah Nushirwan,
<lb/>And hung them there—a warning to the rest.
<lb/>The Shah gave that interpreter of dreams
<lb/>Purse, steeds, and robes, and, wondering at his knowledge,
<lb/>Observed his sayings. They inscribed his name
<lb/>Among the counsellors, the archimages.
<lb/>Thus prospered Buzurjmihr, and circling heaven
<lb/>Showed him its face, while ever day by day
<lb/>His fortune greatened, and the Shah’s heart joyed
<lb/>In him exceedingly.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1660"/>
<lb/>That heart was full
<lb/>Of right; the Shah was cultured, heart and brain.
<lb/>He had residing at his court archmages,
<lb/>And sages understanding in all knowledge.
<lb/>Three score and ten—all men of eloquence—
<lb/>Were lodged and entertained continually.
<lb/>He used, when not engaged with justice, largess,
<lb/>Festivity or war, to question them,
<lb/>And deck his heart with knowledge. Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>Though still a youth, was eloquent and shrewd
<lb/>And fair to look upon, surpassing all
<lb/>The famed archmages, readers of the stars,
<lb/>And sages, in his knowledge, and became
<lb/>Exalted over those philosophers.
<lb/>None was so learned in astrology.
<lb/>In leechcraft he excelled <note>Reading with P.</note> and spoke with ease
<lb/>Of conduct, government, and policies.

</div>  

<div><pb n="287"/>

<head>§ 2 The first Banquet of Nushirwan to the Sages, and the Counsels of Buzurjmihr</head>
<p>
<lb/>The board was spread one day. The Shah commanded:
<lb/>"Bid the archmages come, the learned, the curious,
<lb/>The eloquent, the prudent, and observing."
<lb/>The archmages vigilant of heart, the chiefs
<lb/>That were accomplished in all knowledge, came,
<lb/>And, having feasted, called for wine and drank
<lb/>Until their spirits rose, not bringing wisdom
<lb/>To disrepute but to refresh their souls.
<lb/>The prudent Shah said to those men of lore:
<lb/>"Display the hidden knowledge that ye have;
<lb/>Let every one possessed of understanding
<lb/>Within his heart hold forth and pleasure me."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The wise men bold and mighty in discourse
<lb/>Set loose their tongues in presence of the king,
<lb/>Both young and old, as he required of them.
<lb/>When Buzurjmihr had listened to their words,
<lb/>And noted that the Shah held knowledge dear,
<lb/>He rose, did reverence, and said: "Just judge!
<lb/>Be earth the bondslave of thine ivory throne,
<lb/>Heaven lustrous with the Glory of thy crown.
<lb/>If now the Shah shall bid his slave unlock
<lb/>His tongue then I will speak although unworthy,
<lb/>And, in respect of knowledge, least of all.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1661"/>
<lb/>No wise man can be blamed for having loosed:
<lb/>His tongue in presence of Shah Nushirwan."
<lb/>The monarch looked upon the sage and said:
<lb/>"What reason can there be for hiding knowledge?"
<lb/>The youth forthwith displayed his mastery,
<lb/>And spread light round him while his eloquence
<lb/>And counsels fixed the archimages’ hearts.
</p>
<pb n="288"/>

<p>
<lb/>He first displayed his gifts in praise of God,
<lb/>And then proceeded: "One whose mind is clear
<lb/>Will utter much in little; hasty folk
<lb/>Are talkative and tedious. When fools' talk
<lb/>Endureth long the speaker is despised.
<lb/>Seek worth and not 'addition, for the world
<lb/>Is fleeting, and we are but sojourners.
<lb/>Were our days to endure forevermore
<lb/>The world would have too many candidates.
<lb/>While here below humanity is best,
<lb/>And knowledge in that view will not gainsay thee.
<lb/>Our inward light we owe to righteousness,
<lb/>And we must weep o’er darkness and chicane.
<lb/>The heart of every one is slave to passion,
<lb/>Which differeth with each, and in the world
<lb/>Each hath his humour; it is well that thou
<lb/>Conform therewith. All foremost in affairs
<lb/>Still will be scheming and endeavouring more,
<lb/>But sages, scholars, and the inly blest
<lb/>Dwell here below and set their hearts above.
<lb/>Vex not thyself about the unattained;
<lb/>'Tis toil of body and distress of soul.
<lb/>He that is strong will act straightforwardly,
<lb/>But lies and double-dealing come of weakness.
<lb/>If thou lack knowledge silence is the jewel,
<lb/>While if thou art in love with thine own knowledge
<lb/>Debate will take that wisdom out of thee.
<lb/>Rich is the man that hath not greed, and blest
<lb/>Is he that hath not covetise for mate.
<lb/>Humanity is brother unto wisdom,
<lb/>Which is as 'twere the crown upon the soul.
<lb/>To have a sage for mortal enemy
<lb/>Is better for thee than a fool for friend.
<lb/>The man content is rich; he putteth greed
<lb/>And care in bonds. Thou wilt give ear to sages
<lb/>If thou art humble in thy wish to learn.
</p>
<pb n="289"/>

<p>
<lb/>When one is masterful in counselling
<lb/>Men falter not in action. Let the man
<lb/>That hath forgot his knowledge hold his tongue.
<lb/>When thou hast wealth in hand with gold and silver,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1662"/>
<lb/>And steeds caparisoned, in daily cost
<lb/>Be neither close nor lavish. Choose the mean,
<lb/>And let thine only guide be rectitude.
<lb/>The wise man keepeth foes afar, and they
<lb/>Become his servants. Know thou, he that doth
<lb/>His best will win in war. Speak not vain words,
<lb/>For from that fire ensueth naught but smoke.
<lb/>Spend not thy thoughts upon what ne'er can be,
<lb/>Because with water thou canst pierce not iron.
<lb/>A king if he be learned is humble too
<lb/>Though knowledge make him great and powerful.
<lb/>He that acknowledgeth God's handiwork
<lb/>Hath passed the ills of fortune; he will serve
<lb/>God more and more, cast out the Div's suggestions,
<lb/>Refrain himself from what should not be done,
<lb/>Afflict not those that should be unafflicted,
<lb/>And in the last resort incline to God,
<lb/>Who is our Nourisher and Fosterer."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Now at that goodly speech of Buzurjmihr
<lb/>The doctors all grew fresh of countenance,
<lb/>Rose in the presence of the king of kings,
<lb/>And proffered praise anew. The company
<lb/>Were all astound at Buzurjmihr, that one
<lb/>So young should rise so high. The world-lord marvelled
<lb/>At him, then summoned the chief registrars,
<lb/>And bade them set his name first on the roll:
<lb/>His fortune shone forth like the sun in heaven.
<lb/>Again the archmages entered on discourse,
<lb/>While all the sages were in wonderment;
<lb/>The youth set loose his tongue, for he was pure
<lb/>Of heart and of an ardent soul, and thus
</p>
<pb n="290"/>

<p>
<lb/>He said: "We must not even in our thoughts
<lb/>Turn from the king, the righteous judge, for he
<lb/>Is as the shepherd and we are the sheep;
<lb/>Again, we are the earth, he is high heaven.
<lb/>We must not quit our fealty to him,
<lb/>Must not renounce his way and ordinance,
<lb/>But joy when he is glad, if we are fain
<lb/>To proffer to him all the age's due,
<lb/>Diffuse his excellences in the world,
<lb/>But keep his confidence inviolate.
<lb/>Presume not thou upon his dignity,
<lb/>For e'en the lion's heart is frayed by fire.
<lb/>We should call e'en a mountain that despised
<lb/>His bidding foolish-hearted and light-witted.
<lb/>All evil and all good come from the Shah,
<lb/>From him come bond and dungeon, crown and throne.
<lb/>The world hath from his love its worth and Grace,
<lb/>While at his wrath our livers seethe within us.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1663"/>
<lb/>The crowned head is the Grace of God, the sage
<lb/>Hath joy and mirth therefrom. Of Ahriman
<lb/>Is he that joyeth not; his heart and brain
<lb/>Are cultured not with knowledge."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They gave ear
<lb/>To what the young man said, and those outworn
<lb/>Revived in soul. With tongues and mouths all praise
<lb/>That mighty convocation went its ways.

<head>§ 3 The second Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and the Archimages</head>
<p>
<lb/>A se'nnight passed. That king of ardent heart
<lb/>Convoked the wise and shelved the world’s affairs
<lb/>Because he wished to hear the words of sages—
<pb n="291"/>
<lb/>Those that were worthy to be called to court,
<lb/>And were approved by knowledge to the Shah.
<lb/>They came, the wise in utterance, both young
<lb/>And elders of experience. With the doctors
<lb/>Of ardent soul fared youthful Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>The exalted one. These doctors sage and shrewd
<lb/>Sat near the lofty throne and turned their looks
<lb/>On Buzurjmihr because at him the face
<lb/>Of Nushirwan grew bright. One of the wisest
<lb/>Then questioned him concerning fate and fortune:
<lb/>"What is their character and who ordained them?"
<lb/>He answered: "One aspireth, being young.
<lb/>He toileth night and day, and yet his path
<lb/>Is dark and narrow and his conduit low,
<lb/>While some mere dolt will sleep on fortune’s throne,
<lb/>And rose-trees scatter roses over him.
<lb/>Such is the character of fate and fortune,
<lb/>No toil avoideth their apportionment;
<lb/>The World-lord, the All-wise, our Fosterer,
<lb/>Hath fashioned thus the star of destiny."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: "What man attaineth greatness?
<lb/>To whom is high estate the most becoming?"
<lb/>He said: "The man that hath the better knowledge
<lb/>Of what is good and putteth it in practice."
<lb/>Another said: "What is there best in us?
<lb/>Who from the world is worthiest of good?"
<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>He answered: "Gentleness, munificence,
<lb/>With magnanimity and courteousness.
<lb/>The humble man who boweth down his neck;
<lb/>His hand will give, expecting no return;
<lb/>He toileth and by toil would win the world,
<lb/>And keepeth step with fellow wayfarers."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>"What is the special virtue of the sage,"
<lb/>Another said, "in moments of dispute?"
<milestone unit="calced" n="1664"/>
<lb/>He answered: "To discern when he is wrong,
<lb/>And modify his methods and his views."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another one inquired: "How should one act
<lb/>To make existence more endurable?"
<lb/>He thus made answer: "Whensoe'er the heart
<lb/>Is fraught with wisdom there is gladness too.
<lb/>Then will the man both give and take aright,
<lb/>And shut the door of fraud and knavery,
<lb/>Will pardon faults whene'er he hath the power,
<lb/>And not be hasty or irascible."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another asked of him: "Among the folk
<lb/>Who is best able to command himself?"
<lb/>He said: "The man that is not led by passion
<lb/>Away from nobleness and native worth,
<lb/>And likewise he that can command his weakness,
<lb/>Aware that evils follow on excess."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: "Is there aught anywhere
<lb/>More excellent than bounty and good nature?
<lb/>Who bringeth speedily his crop to fruit,
<lb/>And furnisheth two springtides in a year?"
<lb/>"One," thus he made reply, "that all unasked
<lb/>Doth deck his soul with generosity,
<lb/>But one that hath the praise of the receiver
<lb/>Regard him not as giving but as trading."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: "What are the adornments of a man,
<lb/>And which is noblest?"
<lb/>Buzurjmihr replied:
<lb/>"He that is bounteous toward a worthy object;
<lb/>He towereth like a cypress in a garden,
<lb/>And never withereth, but one unworthy,
<lb/>Though he be set in musk, will savour not;
<lb/>No flower will grow upon that arid thorn.
<lb/>To question of the dumb or of the deaf,
<lb/>Though thou art justified, is profitless."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>"Within this Wayside Inn," another said,
<lb/>"The sage is not exempt from pain and trouble.
<lb/>How shall we act that we may win fair fame,
<lb/>And so begin that nobly we may end?"
<lb/>He answered: "Keep from sin; treat all the world
<lb/>As though it were thyself; what thou mislikest
<lb/>Inflict not on another—friend or foe."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: "Which sayest thou of the twain
<lb/>Is better—labour moderate or great?"
<lb/>He answered thus: "From wisdom's standpoint thought
<lb/>Alone is worthy. If thou needest fruit
<lb/>Toil in proportion to the work in hand."
<lb/>"If we must weep o'er those that are to blame,"
<lb/>Another asked, "who can deserve our praise?"
<lb/>He answered thus: "Whoever hath the most
<lb/>Of hope and fear and awe of holy God."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: "O thou illustrious
<lb/>In wisdom and whose head out-toppeth heaven!
<lb/>What is the goodliest destiny for me
<lb/>From this exalted and unstable sky?"
<milestone unit="calced" n="1665"/>
<lb/>That man of eloquence made answer: "His
<lb/>Who is secure and is exempt from need;
<lb/>Him fortune treateth with benevolence
<lb/>So long as he is just in all his ways."
<lb/>"What is the knowledge," asked another one,
<lb/>"Whereby I may be happy in the world?"
<lb/>He answered thus: "That of the patient man,
<lb/>Who holdeth in contempt the impudent,
<lb/>And his whose brain is not perturbed by wrath,
<lb/>And who, though wroth, will wink at others' faults."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another asked: "What man is he, O sage!
<lb/>That winneth the approval of the wise?"
<lb/>Said Buzurjmihr: "The man whom wisdom feedeth,
<lb/>Who mourneth not the lost but giveth up
<lb/>His darling to the dust without regret,
<lb/>Pain, or dismay, rejecteth empty hopes
<lb/>Like willow's fruit, is always glad and gay,
<lb/>And careless of the processes of time."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: "What are the faults of kings
<lb/>Whereby the hearts of righteous men are saddened?"
<lb/>He answered: "Wise men say that there are four:
<lb/>The first is terror of the foe in fight;
<lb/>The second being niggardly in giving;
<lb/>The third rejecting wise advice in war;
<lb/>The fourth is hastiness of temperament,
<lb/>And sleeping not upon their purposes."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another one inquired: "What man is faultless,
<lb/>And what is there to blame in noble men?"
<lb/>"We call one upright," thus said Buzurjmihr,
<lb/>"When wisdom beareth witness to his words,
<lb/>While those that seek by cunning and injustice
<lb/>To shine are blamed for falsehood and deceit.
<lb/>Between them is the man of violence,
<lb/>Abusive, with his head fulfilled with strife,
<lb/>And who, though meek and humble with the king,
<lb/>Yet madly persecuteth holy men."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another said: "What kind of character
<lb/>Will profit him that seeketh not mishap?"
<lb/>"The speaker of the truth is true in all
<lb/>His deeds," he answered, "governeth his tongue,
<lb/>Is modest, and soft-voiced amidst of clamour.
<lb/>Best is the sage who holdeth it unmeet
<lb/>To banish wisdom for the sake of passion."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Another sage inquired: "Who is the man
<lb/>That can without mishap transact affairs,
<lb/>Tend his own life, and profit kith and kin?"
<lb/>He thus made answer: "He that from the first
<lb/>Hath known and sought the door of holy God—



<lb/>The Source of thy thanksgivings and thy Refuge,
<lb/>The Lord of day and night, of sun and moon.
<lb/>Moreover heartily he must obey
<lb/>The Shah’s behests in public and in private,
<lb/>Tend his own person dearly and shut fast
<lb/>Thereon the door of travail and of greed,
<lb/>Must care for his own kindred, feed the poor,
<lb/>And give his children teachers, for the world
<lb/>Must not be trusted to the ignorant,
<lb/>And when a son is docile to command
<lb/>"Tis for the father to make much of him.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“What is the place an upright son should hold,”
<lb/>Another asked him, “in his sire’s esteem?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus made answer: “In his father’s eyes
<lb/>A glorious son is dear as life itself:
<lb/>The father’s name abideth after death
<lb/>Because the son will say: ‘My father taught me.’”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another asked: “What dost thou see in riches
<lb/>To grace the heart?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He made reply: “The man
<lb/>Of wealth is honoured though the wealth is vile;
<lb/>But there is much that is bound up therewith,
<lb/>Take heed that thou misprize not these my words,
<lb/>For, first, whate’er thou hast a mind unto
<lb/>Will by its nature show if thine be good;
<lb/>And, next, for thee to have and not employ
<lb/>Is to treat stones and royal gems as one.”
<lb/>‘Among the kings with fame and lofty crown,”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said, “whom callest thou the best?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“That king,” he made reply, “with whom the good
<lb/>Dwell safely while the bad quake at his voice:
<lb/>The earth reposeth underneath his throne.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Another said: “What maketh a man rich,
<lb/>And who in this world is distressed and poor?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He thus replied: “The man that is content
<lb/>With what the Master of high heaven bestoweth,
<lb/>While for the man whom fortune favoureth not
<lb/>There is not any evil worse than greed.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The famous men were full of wonderment
<lb/>At him and lauded him with one consent.

<head>§ 4
The third Banquet of Nushirwan to Buzurjmihr and
the Archimages</head>
<p>
<lb/>A se'nnight passed. The eighth day with the dawn
<lb/>The all-conquering Shah sat on his throne and summoned
<lb/>Before him all the men of understanding,
<lb/>The wise and eloquent, who all discoursed
<lb/>At large, but truly none much pleased the Shah,
<lb/>Who after said to Buzurjmihr: "Unveil
<lb/>Thy shamefast face."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That fluent sage set loose
<lb/>His tongue, displayed his varied lore, and first
<lb/>He blessed the Shah, and said: "Be this crowned head
<lb/>Victorious," adding: "None becometh great
<lb/>Unless he shun the pathway of mishap.
<lb/>If thou wouldst rise to greatness by thy knowledge
<lb/>Thou needest wisdom in thy choice of words.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1667"/>
<lb/>In quest of fame one must be brave, the age
<lb/>Rejecteth faint-hearts. If thou seek’st the throne
<lb/>Accomplishments are needed since the bough
<lb/>That putteth forth its green must bear thee fruit.
<lb/>When folk make question of accomplishments
<lb/>Tis vain to cite mere aptitude," <note n="1">Or “high lineage.”</note> for that,
<lb/>With these to seek, is not approved and worthless.
<lb/>In dealing with this point a wise man said:—
<lb/>'If roses savour not forbear to speak
<lb/>Of colour; none in fire a stream will seek.'
<lb/>A king is all the richer for his bounty,
<lb/>And hath no credit for his secret treasures.
<lb/>If thou hast claimed attainments justify
<lb/>What thou hast fairly spoken by thy deeds.
<lb/>The sage is happy being fed by heaven
<pb n="297"/>
<lb/>With wisdom, and the man of simple heart
<lb/>Because ‘tis free from all deceitfulness.
<lb/>In this world wisdom is a trusty tree,
<lb/>And the great king’s heart is its first of fruits.
<lb/>Thou wilt be easy if thou art content,
<lb/>But practise greed and thou wilt quake therefor.
<lb/>Do not thy kindness in the sight of men,
<lb/>For thou wilt have small kindness in return.
<lb/>Good fortune favoureth the open-hearted,
<lb/>And he is blest who beareth patiently.
<lb/>Still if a man would rise he must be furnished
<lb/>With certain things to aid him in the struggle.
<lb/>First, rede and erudition; secondly,
<lb/>A ripe experience; thirdly, friends to help
<lb/>In time of action and to estimate
<lb/>The chances every way for good and ill,
<lb/>And to be profitable afterward.
<lb/>In everyday life and emergencies.
<lb/>He needeth, fourthly, rectitude and wisdom
<lb/>To purge his heart of falsehood and of fraud,
<lb/>And, fifthly, if thou art possessed of strength
<lb/>Toil with thy body; greatness will result." <note n="2">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The strong unless they labour ne'er will reach
<lb/>The height of their desires, but over-toil,
<lb/>Know, endeth in despair. I will set forth
<lb/>The five characteristics of the sage,
<lb/>Which to observe involve him not in trouble,
<lb/>With seven too of the fool, and 'tis no marvel
<lb/>If he be irked thereby: and, to begin,
<lb/>No sage is vexed at loss or prematurely
<lb/>Is glad, for disappointment will perturb him.
<lb/>He counteth not upon the unattained
<lb/>So as to break his heart if he should miss it.
<lb/>He neither hopeth that which ne'er can be,
<lb/>Nor saith: 'The willow-bough will bring forth fruit.'
<pb n="298"/>
<lb/>When at his ease from travail and from ill
<lb/>He recketh of the future, wherefore when
<lb/>Time bringeth hardship on him he will prove
<lb/>Beforehand and not slack in enterprise.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1668"/>
<lb/>The fool’s way, as I said, is sevenfold:
<lb/>His wrath is kindled with the innocent,
<lb/>His treasure opened to the unworthy man
<lb/>Without return of meed or recompense,
<lb/>While, thirdly, he is an ingrate to God,
<lb/>And is not wise and cognizant of good,
<lb/>But, fourthly, talketh loudly of himself
<lb/>To every one and, fifthly, is involved
<lb/>In pain and loss through his own feckless words;
<lb/>He trusteth, sixthly, to untrusty folk,
<lb/>Expecting thorns to bear him painted silk,
<lb/>And, lastly, uttereth lies in argument,
<lb/>Endeavouring to shine by impudence.
<lb/>Know this, O thou exalted sovereign!
<lb/>That no man getteth aught but harm from ill.
<lb/>When any one is mute in company
<lb/>That silence is melodious to the heart.
<lb/>By hearing some one wise and eloquent
<lb/>Thou wilt get provand for thy body, counsel
<lb/>And prudence for thy heart. Forget not thou
<lb/>Such words because they crown the throne of knowledge.
<lb/>If thou wouldst bring that knowledge into bearing
<lb/>Release thy jewel from its case by speech,
<lb/>And if thou wouldst extend thy fame draw forth
<lb/>Thy tongue as ‘twere a falchion from its sheath;
<lb/>But if thou holdest session with the unwise" <note n="3">Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The under then will have the upper hand.
<lb/>By knowledge are the soul and heart illumined;
<lb/>See thou go not about to compass lies.
<lb/>When one of eloquence is holding forth
<lb/>Abide his words, be not impatient;
<pb n="299"/>
<lb/>Thou mayst get wisdom from his utterances,
<lb/>And afterwards repeat what thou hast heard.
<lb/>Use not thy wisdom as a means of gain
<lb/>Though not to do so may result in hardship.
<lb/>With heart and tongue in an accord of right
<lb/>The door of loss is barred on every side.
<lb/>Oh! may the heart of Nushirwan, the Shah,
<lb/>Be open to instruction evermore."
</p>
<p>An archimage of subtle intellect
<lb/>Then asked: "What are the good and seemly things
<lb/>That give a man a lustre in the world,
<lb/>And quittance from the troubles of the time?"
<lb/>He answered thus: 'Whoe'er attaineth wisdom
<lb/>Will gain thereby the fruitage of both worlds."
<lb/>'But if he hath not wisdom," said the archmage,
<lb/>"Since wisdom is God’s radiant robe of honour?"
</p>
<p>Said Buzurjmihr: "Then knowledge is the best,
<lb/>The learned is mighty midst the men of might."
</p>
<p>"But if," the archmage said, "he hath not sought
<lb/>That stream and never bathed his soul therein?"
<lb/>Thus Buzurjmihr replied: "The warrior
<lb/>Must count his body as a worthless thing,
<lb/>And if he striveth in the day of battle,
<lb/>And layeth foemen’s heads upon the dust,
<lb/>He will be cherished in the great king’s heart,
<lb/>For ever happy and in good command."
<milestone unit="calced" n="1669"/>
<lb/>'But if one is not valiant," said the archimage,
<lb/>Nor seeketh after knowledge, law, and Faith?"
</p>
<p>Then Buzurjmihr replied: "'Twere well that death
<lb/>Should set the helm of darkness on his head."
</p>
<p>Another asked: "How shall we act that all
<lb/>Of us may eat the fruitage of the tree
<lb/>Set by the sage within the garth of spring,
<lb/>And walk moreover underneath its shade?"
</p>
<p>Said Buzurjmihr: "The man that barreth up
<lb/>His tongue from evil vexeth not his soul,
<pb n="300"/>
<lb/>And rendeth not in talk another’s skin.
<lb/>He will be likewise friends with all the folk,




<lb/>All troubles will be smoothed away for him,
<lb/>And enemy and friend will be as one."</p>

<p>Another asked him, saying: "Are the men
<lb/>That shun the way of failure great or good?"</p>

<p>Thus Buzurjmihr replied: "An evil deed
<lb/>Is like a tree that beareth evil fruit.
<lb/>Thus if a man speak gently with his tongue
<lb/>But little harshness will befall his ear,
<lb/>For know it is the tongue that troubleth men;
<lb/>So if thou wouldst be easy weigh thy words.
<lb/>The man of few words and a loyal subject
<lb/>Hath only one fit post—before the throne.
<lb/>Moreover he escapeth ills not come,
<lb/>As bird or beast escapeth from the net,
<lb/>While furthermore he triumpheth o’er evil,
<lb/>Is self-controlled and wise exceedingly.
<lb/>He leaveth well alone and troubleth not
<lb/>The inoffensive, letteth no good 'scape him,
<lb/>And counteth not upon the days to come.
<lb/>He shunneth foe with more than quarry’s speed,
<lb/>And cleaveth unto friend like shaft and feather.
<lb/>For any pleasure that will end in grief
<lb/>The man of wisdom hath but little yearning.
<lb/>Put ease and indolence afar from thee,
<lb/>Take pains and make a feast of toil; without it
<lb/>Thou wilt win not addition in the world;
<lb/>There is no treasure for the indolent." <note n="1">The two following couplets are transposed.</note>
<lb/>May this world live in Nushirwan, be he
<lb/>Its world-lord ever and his fortune young."</p>

<p>They held discourse at large upon this theme:
<lb/>The hearts of those grown drowsy were awakened.
<lb/>The archimages, magnates, and shrewd sages
<lb/>Blessed Buzurjmihr and gave the Shah great praise,
<lb/>Then went rejoicing on their several ways.
