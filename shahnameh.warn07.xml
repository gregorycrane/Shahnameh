<head>XXXV BAHRAM GUR: HE REIGNED SIXTY-THREE YEARS</head>


<div>
<head>ARGUMENT</head>
<p>Bahram’s accession and inaugural measures. His adventures, amorous and otherwise, among his subjects. His relations with foreign potentates. His instructions to his officials, and remission of taxation. His introduction of the Gypsies into Iran, and his death.</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>NOTE</head>
<p>Bahram Gur (Varahran V., A.D. 420-438) is said by Tabari and Mas'udi to have been twenty years old at the time of his accession.<note place="foot">NT, p. 98; MM, ii. 190.</note> 

According to Tabari he reigned either eighteen or twenty-three years.<note place="foot">NT, p. 112.</note> Mas'udi says the latter.<note place="foot">MM, id.</note> On the other hand, Mir Khand, who tells us that he followed the most generally received account, perhaps Firdausi’s own, states that Bahram reigned sixty-three years.<note>RM, Pt. I, Vol. ii. p. 362.</note> No doubt, popular tradition lovingly prolonged to the utmost the reign of this Shah who, like James V. of Scotland, was <quote>King of the Commons.</quote> The poet was at no loss for material in this part of his work, and the reign is the most diverting in the Shahnameh. Its interest with regard to the question of the provenance of the Arabian Nights has been noted already.<note place="foot">See Vol. vi. p. 250.</note> As is to be expected in the circumstances, the subject-matter is largely legendary, though some authentic features have been preserved, and there can be little doubt but that Bahram’s own character as depicted by Firdausi is in the main historically correct. He fulfilled the promises made by him when a candidate for the throne.</p>


<pb n="4"/>

<p>but gave himself up largely to pleasure, though this does not seem
to have impaired his activities at critical moments. He appears, too,
to have been fortunate in his administrators. His chief minister,
Mihr Narsi, who is not to be confounded with Narsi, the Shah’s
brother, and three of his sons were at the head of affairs. One
was the principal, or nearly so, of the official hierarchy, another
was chief superintendent of the taxes, and the third was commander-in-chief.<note n="1">NT, pp. 106, 108 seq.</note> Mihr Narsi and his father Burdza are stated to
have held office under Yazdagird, Bahram’s father, and the former
was reappointed chief minister when Yazdagird, Bahram’s son,
came to the throne.<note n="2">ZT, ii. pp. 122, 127; NT, pp. 113.</note> He was himself a prince and an Arsacid, so
it would seem that the supplanted family had regained a great
position for itself under the new dispensation, and that the state of
things fully justified the pronouncement put by later legend into
the mouth of Kaid.<note n="3">See Vol. vi. pp. 256, 267.</note> Bahram Gur began his reign with a persecution
of the Christians, which led to war with the Eastern Roman
Empire. There is a slight allusion to such a war in the poem,<note n="4">See p. 84.</note> but
the chief incident recorded to have taken place is a pacific one.<note n="5">See p. 100 seq.</note>
§§ 1 and 2. Bahram devotes the first days of his reign to
carrying out his promises of reform made before his accession,<note n="6">See Vol. vi. p. 406.</note>
and to the relief of taxation.
§§ 3-16. We have here a series of popular legends of Bahram’s
adventures when going about unrecognised among various classes
of his subjects. The story of the miser occurs twice.<note n="7">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note><note n="8">§§ 4 and 15 seg.</note>
§§ 19-22. We have here the story of Bahram’s most famous
exploit, which is historical, though as much cannot be said of the
various details with which popular appreciation has embellished it.
Historically, the foes over whom Bahram won his great triumph
were the Hephthalites, or White Huns.<note n="9">See Vol. i. p. 19.</note> This is clear on Firdausi’s
own showing when he comes to the reign of Piruz.<note n="10">See p. 164 seq.</note> Later on
again, in the reign of Nushirwan, ample distinction is made
between the subjects of the Khan of Chin and the Hephthalites,<note n="11">See p. 328 seg.</note>
In substituting the former for the latter on this occasion Firdausi
errs in good company, Tabari, Mas'udi, and Mir Khand all name
the Turks as the enemy,<note n="12">NT, p. 99; MM, ii. 190; RM, Pt. I., Vol. ii. p. 357.</note> and since they did not come upon the
scene for another century and more,<note n="13">See Vol. i. p. 20.</note> we learn approximately the


<pb n="5"/> 
earliest date at which the story of Bahram’s exploit could have been edited in its existing form. According to the Persian Tabari<note n="1">ZT, ii. 120.</note> —the version adapted from the original Arabic by Bal’ami, the minister of the Samanid prince Mansur, son of Nuh (a.p. 961-976), about a.p. 963—the Khan was put to flight, according to the Arabic<note n="2">NT, p. 101.</note> slain in the battle by Bahram’s own hand. Both agree that the Khatun, or wife of the Khan, was taken prisoner and sent to serve in the famous Fire-temple at Shiz, whither Bahram had gone to pray for success in his expedition.<note n="3">See p. 86; ZT, ii. 121; NT, 104.</note> According to the Arabic Tabari, Bahram, as an act of thanksgiving for his victory, relieved his subjects of taxation for three years.<note n="4">NT, 105.</note> This probably is the popular version of the fact that great reforms in that connexion were effected during his reign, but they could not have been justified, one would think, to the extent stated by the amount of plunder taken from the Hephthalites, and still less to the extent described in the Shahnama, which affirms that he almost reformed taxation away altogether. It may be added that the various accounts of Bahram’s expedition against the Hephthalites are in substantial accord though they differ in detail, e.g., as to how far the enemy had advanced at the time of the battle, the route that Bahram followed in his march, and the number of troops that he took with him.
</p>

<p> §24. Bahram’s war with the Eastern Roman Empire, in which he was not very successful, came to an end in a.p. 422, but Firdausi (§ 19) makes it synchronise with that against the Hephthalites which, according to the Persian Tabari,<note n="5">ZT, ii. 119.</note> took place five years later. Next we hear of an envoy sent by Caesar (§§ 19, 23), and then of his belated audience with the Shah. The points discussed are not the terms of peace, but certain “hard questions,”<note n="6">As to which see p. 102 seq.</note> and it is only incidentally that the envoy mentions that Rum is ready to pay tribute to Iran. We have a similar case in the reign of Nushirwan when the Raja of Hind sends the game of chess to that Shah, who returns the compliment with the game of nard,<note n="7">See p. 384 seq.</note> while in the next volume we shall find the disgraced counsellor Buzurjmihr regaining the favour of the same Shah by his success in solving another problem set by Caesar. §§ 26-38. For instances in the Shahnama of kings going incognito to visit foreign courts, see Vol. vi. pp. 325, 335. In the Arabic Tabari, Bahram’s motive for visiting Hind is to see whether by annexing a portion of it he could lighten the taxes of his own


<pb n="6"/>
subjects.<note n="1">NT, p. 106.</note> Unlike his expedition against the Khan of Chin, as Firdausi puts it, and historically against the Hephthalites, the one to Hind appears to be wholly fabulous. It is given, however, at length by Tabari and Mir Khand, and mentioned by Mas’udi.<note n="2">Id. RM, I, ii. 360; MM, ii. 191.</note> It will be seen that Bahram in the course of his well-meant efforts to promote the welfare of his subjects does not find it quite so easy as he expected to make everybody happy by legislation. 
</p><p>
§39. Professor Noldeke is inclined to consider Bahram’s importation of Gypsies from Hind to Iran historical.<note n="3">NT, p. 99 note.</note> The details of course belong to the province of popular legend, but are delightfully characteristic of both parties concerned. The Gypsy language appears to be a debased form of Hindustani. According to Mir Khand the Gypsies intermarried with the Persians, and the Jats were said to be their offspring. Consequently, nearly every Jat is a  musician.<note n="4">RM, I, ii. 357.</note>
</p>

<p>§40. Firdausi is almost alone in his statement that Bahram Gur died in his bed. The common account is that he was killed when out hunting by falling into one of the underground water-courses, so common in Persia, and that his body never was recovered. Popular tradition places the scene of his death in a valley between Shiraz and Isfahan and known as the “Vale of Heroes,” where there are numerous springs supposed to be intercommunicating and of great depth. Sir John Malcolm states that one of his escort was drowned in 1810 when bathing in the identical spring in which Bahram is said to have perished.<note n="5">MHP, i. 94 and note.</note> Tabari lays the scene of the accident in Media, and it took place, if it took place at all, probably not far from Hamadan at a spot called, according to Dinawari, Dih Marj. Noldeke, however, considers that the whole story was made up to account for the nickname “Gur” bestowed upon Bahram. The word in question means both “onager” and “tomb.”<note n="6">NT, 103 and note.</note> The same collocation of letters also means a “Fire-worshipper,” and it is possible that some Muhammadan translator from the Pahlavi may have thought fit to dispatch the guebre to the grave.

<head>§ 1 How Bahram ascended the Throne, charged the Officers, and wrote Letters to all the Chiefs</head>
<p>
<lb/>Whenas Bahram Gur sat upon the throne
<lb/>The sun acclaimed him while the Shah adored
<lb/>The Maker—the all-seeing, watchful World-lord,
<lb/>The Lord of victory and majesty,
<lb/>The Lord of increase and of loss—then said:<q>From Him have I received the throne and crown,
<lb/>For He hath fashioned fortune, and my hopes
<lb/>And fears are all in Him. I give Him thanks
<lb/>For all His benefits; do ye too praise Him,
<lb/>And strive to keep His covenant unbroken.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The Iranians answered:<q>We are girt for service.
<lb/>May this crown prove right glorious to the Shah,
<lb/>And may his heart and fortune live forever.</q>
<lb/>Their praises done, all scattered gems before him.
<lb/>Thus said Bahram:<q>O chiefs experienced
<lb/>In daily good and ill! we all are slaves,
<lb/>And God is One, sole-worthy to be worshipped.
<lb/>From fear of evil days we will secure you,
<lb/>And not expose you to malignant Need.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spoke. They rose and homaged him anew.
<lb/>They spent the night in converse, and at sunrise
<lb/>The Shah sat peacefully upon his throne,
<lb/>The Iranians came to audience, and he said:<q>Ye chieftains famed and favored by the stars!
<lb/>Put we our trust in God and joy in Him,
<lb/>Boast not and root out of the world our hearts.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>He spoke and then those Glories of his court—
<lb/>His chiefs—called for their steeds. The Shah, the third day,
<lb/>Sat on the throne, and said:<q>Religious usage

<pb n="8"/>

<lb/>Must be observed. We witness to God's being,
<lb/>And make our souls familiar with the Faith.
<lb/>There is a Resurrection, Heaven, and Hell,
<lb/>And we cannot escape from good and ill.
<lb/>Ascribe not Faith or knowledge to the man
<lb/>That doubteth of the Day of Reckoning.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The fourth day, donning on the ivory throne
<lb/>The well-loved crown, he said:<q>Men, not my treasures,
<lb/>Are my delight. This Wayside Inn I ask not,
<lb/>And grudge not going, for the other world
<lb/>Is everlasting and this transitory.
<lb/>Abstain from greed and trouble not thyself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The fifth day he said thus:<q>I have no joy
<lb/>In others' toils for mine aggrandizement;
<lb/>We toil in quest of jocund Paradise;
<lb/>He that hath sown but seed of good is blest.</q>
<lb/>The sixth day said he to his subjects:<q>Never
<lb/>May we ensue defeat; we will protect
<lb/>Our troops from foes and make malignants tremble.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The seventh day, when he took his seat, he said:<q>Ye chiefs wise, wary, and experienced!
<lb/>Since with the vile we practise villainy
<lb/>We will have conversation with the wise.
<lb/>Ye that are cold to me shall fare still worse
<lb/>Than with my sire, but ye that do my will
<lb/>Must not experience sorrow, pain, and toil.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The eighth day, when he took his seat, he bade
<lb/>Call Jawan of those about the court,
<lb/>And said to him:<q>To every mighty man,
<lb/>To every chief and clime, indite for me
<lb/>A letter couched in just and loving terms,
<lb/>And say: 'Bahram hath mounted on the throne
<lb/>With joy—a lord of bounty and of right,
<lb/>A shunner of all fraud and knavery—</q></p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>
<lb/>For he hath Grace and stature, love and justice:
<lb/>The Judge all-holy is in all his thoughts.
<lb/><q>'I will accept,' he saith, 'the obedient,
<lb/>But fault-condoning maketh faults increase.
<lb/>I sit upon my glorious father's throne,
<lb/>I keep the customs of just Tahmuras,<note n="1">For Tahmuras see Vol. i. p. 125.</note>
<lb/>And treat all justly howsoe'er perverse.
<lb/>I will be juster than mine ancestors,
<lb/>And guide you to the Faith—that of Zarduhsht,
<lb/>The prophet—quitting not my fathers' path.
<lb/>I put the Faith of old Zarduhsht before me;
<lb/>The way of that true prophet is mine own.
<lb/>Be ye all sovereign in your own affairs,
<lb/>And guard your marches and your loyalty,
<lb/>Kings of your children and your women-folk:
<lb/>Blest is the man that is both wise and pure.
<lb/>If God accord us life and favouring stars
<lb/>We will not fill our treasury with gold;
<lb/>Such treasures keep the poor in travail. Read
<lb/>This joyful letter which assureth you
<lb/>Of lasting wealth and honour. To all kings
<lb/>Our greeting, most to those whose warp and woof
<lb/>Are love.''</q>
<lb/>They sealed the letters and made choice
<lb/>Of glorious envoys. Archmage, man of lore,
<lb/>And wary cavalier, those letters bore.</p>

<head>§ 2 How Bahram pardoned the Fault of the Iranians, farewelled Munzir and Numan, and remitted the Iranians' Arrears of Taxes</head>
<p>
<lb/>Next day when Sol rose, when the hills bulked large,
<lb/>And sleep was broken, to Munzir there came
</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1490"/>
<p>
<lb/>A panic-stricken throng and said to him —
<lb/><q><lb/>“Make intercession for us with the Shah
<lb/>To pardon our offences, for the crimes
<lb/>Of Yazdagird so wrought us that the blood
<lb/>Froze in the nobles’ hearts! So much of foul
<lb/>In word and deed, iniquity, distress,
<lb/>And anguish chilled our hearts toward Bahram
<lb/>Because we suffered so beneath his sire.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Munzir’s warm pleadings mollified the Shah,
<lb/>Who being just and noble pardoned all,
<lb/>Whate’er the fault. He decked the imperial palace,
<lb/>And all the good and great resorted thither.
<lb/>When they had got the place of majesty
<lb/>In readiness they seated there the worthy,
<lb/>In every place they spread the board and called
<lb/>For wine and harp and minstrelsy. Next day
<lb/>Another crowd assembled, yet the chief
<lb/>Was wearied not of giving. On the third
<lb/>There were both revels and festivities,
<lb/>And grief was banished from the world-king’s palace.
<lb/>He told the offices done by Nu’man
<lb/>And by Munzir—those men of stainless birth—
<lb/>On his behalf, and all the chiefs acclaimed
<lb/>Those desert dwellings and those men of war.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah next oped his treasury and filled
<lb/>His palace with brocade and gold, steeds, trappings,
<lb/>Mail-coats and scents,<note>Reading with P.</note> and gems of every hue.
<lb/>He gave all to Nu’man and to Munzir,
<lb/>And Jawanwi told o’er to them the gifts.
<lb/>None matched the Shah in bounty and in travail.
<lb/>He gave the other Arabs many presents,
<lb/>So that they left the royal halls, rejoicing.
<lb/>He then had brought a royal robe of honor,
<lb/>A steed, and raiment of a paladin;
<lb/>These gave they to Khusrau, made much of him,
</p>

<pb n="11"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1491"/>

<p>
<lb/>And seated him upon the glorious throne.
<lb/>Then, turning from Khusrau,<note>Reading with P.</note> the king of kings,
<lb/>Descending from his throne, approached the seat
<lb/>Where sat Narsi—a prince, his younger brother,
<lb/>And one with him in heart and tongue. He made
<lb/>Narsi the captain of the host to set
<lb/>The land in order, gave up to his keeping
<lb/>The host at large, and ravished all the realm
<lb/>With bounty, oped the treasury, and paid
<lb/>The troops who gladdened with dinars. The Shah,
<lb/>That man of lore, then bade Gushasp, the scribe,
<lb/>With prudent Jawanwi, the chief accountant,
<lb/>Approach, and ordered them to cancel all
<lb/>Arrears of taxes for the Iranians.

<lb/>These two wise scribes went to their registers,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1491"/>
<lb/>And in this matter called in aid Kaiwan
<lb/>Because he was the expert of the day,
<lb/>And kept the world’s statistics in his breast.
<lb/>They added up the sum of the arrears,
<lb/>And found it ninety and a hundred times
<lb/>Three hundred thousand drachms. These he forgave,
<lb/>And burnt the registers, and all Iran
<lb/>Rejoiced thereat. Whenas all folk were aware
<lb/>Of that event they praised him mightily.
<lb/>They all flocked to the Fire-temples, to the halls
<lb/>Where New Year’s Day and Sada feast were kept,
<lb/>Flung musk upon the Fire and blessed Bahram,
<lb/>The Shah. Thereafter he dispatched officials
<lb/>To go about the world. He sought and gathered
<lb/>Within a certain city all the exiles
<lb/>Of Yazdagird that thus the monarch’s letter
<lb/>Might reach those noble Persians, and inquire
<lb/>Their wishes, sent each chief a robe of honor,
<lb/>And gave to each a province that befitted
<lb/>His station. Noble, archimage, and marchlord,
</p>

<pb n="12"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1492"/>

<p>
<lb/>Whoever heard Bahram’s deliverance,
<lb/>All visited his court with open hearts,
<lb/>And blithe of countenance. He bade each suitor
<lb/>Repair to the high priest and, when the world
<lb/>Had recognised his bidding, he let stand
<lb/>A herald at his gate thus to proclaim:—
<lb/><q><lb/>"Ye subjects of the watchful Shah! abstain
<lb/>From sorrow and from sin, and praise henceforth
<lb/>Him through whose justice earth is prosperous.
<lb/>Take refuge from the world with God alone,
<lb/>For He possesseth all and helpeth all.
<lb/>The man that giveth heed to our command,
<lb/>Not turning from our path and fealty,
<lb/>To him will we increase our benefits,
<lb/>And clear our mind of hate and covetise;
<lb/>But whosoever shunneth what is just
<lb/>Shall suffer retribution at our hands.
<lb/>If God hereafter shall vouchsafe us strength,
<lb/>And matters turn out to our heart’s content,
<lb/>We will add benefit to benefit,
<lb/>And ye shall utter praise on our account."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>At these words all the people of Iran
<lb/>Went full of joy and bright of countenance,
<lb/>And, as the sovereignty became secure,
<lb/>Joy waxed and sorrow minished, while the Shah
<lb/>In feasting, horsemanship upon the Ground,
<lb/>In sport and polo, full employment found.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>§ 3 How Bahram went to the House of Lambak, the Water-carrier, and became his Guest</head>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1492"/>
<lb/>It happened that Bahram Gur went one day
<lb/>With certain warriors to hunt the lion.

<pb n="13"/>
<lb/>An old man, staff in hand, drew near to him,
<lb/>And said: <q>God-fearing Shah! within our city
<lb/>There are two men, one rich, the other poor.
<lb/>Now Barahem, the Jew, a miscreant knave,
<lb/>Is rich in silver and in gold. Lambak,
<lb/>The water-carrier, is of noble nature,
<lb/>Fair-spoken, hospitable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So Bahram
<lb/>Inquired about the two, their words and ways.
<lb/>A worthy said: <q>Lambak, the water-carrier,
<lb/>O great, famed, noble king! is generous,
<lb/>Doth keep a table, and is well disposed.
<lb/>He passeth half the day in water-carrying,
<lb/>The other half in entertaining guests,
<lb/>And leaveth nothing over for the morrow,
<lb/>While Barahem is but a barren Jew,
<lb/>And grasping, and his greed should be exposed.
<lb/>He hath drachms, treasure, and dinars, brocades,
<lb/>And goods of all kinds, but none seeth his bread,
<lb/>And he is ever wrathful at a guest.</q>
<lb/>The Shah then bade a herald: <q>Go, proclaim
<lb/>Before the court: 'To everyone concerned:
<lb/>The water of the water-carrier,
<lb/>Lambak, is bad to drink.'</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He stayed till Sol
<lb/>Grew pale, then mounted a fleet steed and came,
<lb/>Like wind, toward the dwelling of Lambak,
<lb/>Knocked with the ring against the door, and cried:
<lb/><q>A captain of the Iranian host am I,
<lb/>The night is dark, and I have far to go.
<lb/>Let me lodge here tonight. I will behave
<lb/>With honour and discretion.</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>Then Lambak,
<lb/>Pleased with the voice of one that spake so fairly,
<lb/>Made answer straight: <q>Come in, O cavalier!
<pb n="14"/>
<lb/>And may the king approve thee. If ten others
<lb/>Were with thee it were better; each had been
<lb/>A moon above my head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Shah Bahram
<lb/>Dismounted, and Lambak saw to the steed.
<lb/>He gladly rubbed it down and haltered it,
<lb/>Then, when Bahram was seated, ran and brought
<lb/>A chess-board<note>According to the poet’s own showing later on, cheas was not intro
duced into Persia till the reign of Nushirwan. See p. 384 seq.</note> and made shift to furnish food,
<lb/>And all things needful, saying: <q>Noble sir!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1493"/> 
<lb/>Put by the chess-men and begin thy meal.</q> <note n="2">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>The eating done, the host in high delight
<lb/>Brought out a cup of wine. The Shah was all
<lb/>Amazement at that feast of his, kind speech,
<lb/>And cheery mien, passed night there, and at dawn
<lb/>Woke at the salutation of Lambak,
<lb/>Who said: <q>Thy steed, good sooth, fared ill last night.
<lb/>Stay just this one day with me, and if thou
<lb/>Wouldst have a comrade we will summon one,
<lb/>And find the needful. Joy with me one day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king made answer to the water-carrier:
<lb/><q>I have not much on hand today.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Lambak
<lb/>Departed, taking divers water-skins,
<lb/>But nobody appeared to buy his water.
<lb/>In dudgeon he put off his vest and, taking
<lb/>His porter’s knot and bucket in his arms,
<lb/>Went and procured instead at the bazar
<lb/>Meat and dried curds, and in due course put on
<lb/>The pot. His guest took note of all his trouble.
<lb/>Lambak prepared the meal; they ate and drank,
<lb/>And had another sitting. All that night
<lb/>Bahram had wine in hand; Lambak too loved it.
</p>

<pb n="15"/>
<p>
<lb/>When it was day he hurried to Bahram,
<lb/>And said: <q>Be merry night and day, and free
<lb/>From trouble, grief, and toil. Consort with me
<lb/>For yet another day, for, know, thy presence
<lb/>Is life and goods to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“Now God forbid
<lb/>That we should not be happy for a third day,”
<lb/>Bahram said, while the water-carrier blessed him:
<lb/><q>Be merry in thy heart and mate with fortune.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He took to the bazar his water-skins
<lb/>And tackle, which he pledged to some rich man,
<lb/>Bought what he needed and returned in haste
<lb/>Rejoicing to Bahram, and said to him:
<lb/><q>Help with the food, for man must eat.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram
<lb/>Took the meat promptly from him, cut it up,
<lb/>And then proceeded with the cookery.
<lb/>When they had eaten they took wine and goblet,
<lb/>And first of all drank to the king of kings.
<lb/>Lambak, when they had drunk, prepared for sleep,
<lb/>And set a candle by Bahram Gur’s couch.

<lb/>The fourth day, when the sun shone and Bahram Gur
<lb/>Awoke, his host approached and said: <q>Famed sir!
<lb/>Thou hast resided in this small, dark house,
<lb/>And doubtless in discomfort; still if thou
<milestone unit="calced" n="1494"/>
<lb/>Fear’st not the Shah stay in my mean abode
<lb/>Two se’nnights more if so thou hast a mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then Shah Bahram blessed him and said: <q>Live thou
<lb/>Thy years and months in mirth and happiness.
<lb/>We have been jolly in this house three days,
<lb/>While quaffing to the monarchs of the world,
<lb/>And elsewhere I will speak a word for thee
<lb/>That shall make bright thy heart and plans, for sure
<lb/>Thy hospitality shall yield thee fruit,
<lb/>And, if thou perseverest, thrones and crowns.</q>
</p>
<pb n="16"/>
<p>
<lb/>Dust-swift he put the saddle on his steed,
<lb/>Departed merrily and sought the chase.
<lb/>He hunted on till night the hills ’gan ride,
<lb/>Then lightly from his meiny turned aside.
</p>
</div>
<head>§ 4 How Bahram went to the House of Baraham, the Jew, who treated him 
scurvily</head>
<div>
<p>
<lb/>He stole away and made toward the house
<lb/>Of barren Baraham, knocked at the door,
<lb/>And said: <q>The Shah hath come back from the chase,
<lb/>But I was left behind. ’Tis night and I
<lb/>Know not the way, can find not Shah and escort.
<lb/>If I may sojourn in this house tonight
<lb/>I will not trouble any one.</q>
<lb/>A slave
<lb/>Went and reported this to Baraham,
<lb/>Who answered: <q>Trouble not thyself hereat,
<lb/>But say: ‘Thou wilt not get a lodging here.’</q>
<lb/>The messenger departed to Bahram Gur,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is no shelter here for thee.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>Return to him and say:
<lb/>‘I mean to stop. I ask thee for a lodging
<lb/>Tonight and I will trouble thee no further.’</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The servant, hearing this, ran back and said:
<lb/><q>This horseman will not budge tonight and saith
<lb/>As much in many words.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Baraham:
<lb/><q>Go instantly and say: ‘This house is small.
<lb/>The Jew is very poor and every night
<lb/>Reposes, bare and hungry, on the ground.’</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They gave the message, and Bahram Gur said:
<pb n="17"/>
<lb/><q>If here my lodging will prove troublesome
<lb/>I will not enter but will sleep outside
<lb/>The door, ’tis all I want.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said Baraham:
<lb/><q>Brave horseman! thoughtlessly<note>Or "grievously."</note> thou troublest me.
<lb/>Were any one to rob thee in thy sleep
<lb/>I should be plagued enough on thine account.
<lb/>Come in if thou art in distress and want,
<lb/>But on condition that thou askest naught.
<lb/>I have not e’en a napkin wherewithal
<lb/>To wipe my body when ’tis washed at death,
<lb/>Or shroud wherein to wind it.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram rejoined: <q>I will not trouble thee
<lb/>In any way. Thy portal will suffice.
<lb/>I will be watchman, barring bell and cry.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then Baraham was troubled, and his soul
<lb/>A brake of cares. He thought: <q>This saucy fellow
<lb/>Will not depart. How can I cause him trouble
<lb/>About his steed?</q> then said again: <q>Great sir!
<lb/>Thy many words afflict me. If thy steed
<lb/>Shall leave its droppings here and stale or break
<lb/>The tiles, thou shalt remove its dung at dawn,
<lb/>Sweep up, bear off its refuse to the plain,
<lb/>And pay for any breakages at once.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>I pledge my head to this.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Dismounting from his steed he tethered it
<lb/>With its own bridle and unsheathed his sword.
<lb/>He spread his saddle-cloth, used as his pillow
<lb/>The saddle, and reposed upon the floor.
<lb/>The Jew secured the door, brought victuals forth,
<lb/>And sat him down to eat. <q>O cavalier!</q>

<lb/>He said, <q>remember, having heard, this saw:
<lb/><q>Who hath may eat and who hath not look on.</q></q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>I have heard so from of old,</q>






<pb n="18"/>
<lb/>And now I have beheld made manifest
<lb/>What thou hast quoted from a sage’s words.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Jew brought wine forth and, when satiate
<lb/>With food and blither for the drinking, bawled:
<lb/><q>O toilful horseman! list this ancient saw:
<lb/>‘He that hath food and purposeth to eat
<lb/>Will offer his thanksgiving for the meat,
<lb/>For one of substance hath a happy mind,
<lb/>And in his wealth a coat of mail will find;
<lb/>But Empty Pockets is a dry-lipped wight,
<lb/>And, like thee, ravenous at mid of night.’</q>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>’Tis passing wonderful
<lb/>What I have seen, and must not be forgotten,
<lb/>And if thy goblet give thee good at last
<lb/>Then heigh for drinker, wine, and genial cup!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When o’er the mountains Sol displayed its sword
<lb/>Bahram Gur shunned more sleep and put the saddle
<lb/>On his fleet grey. His saddle! Nay, hard pillow.
<lb/>Came Baraham and said: <q>O cavalier!
<lb/>Thou art not faithful to thy word. Thou saidst:
<milestone unit="calced" n="1496"/>
<lb/>‘I will sweep up the droppings of the steed
<lb/>At once.’ Away with them as thou didst promise.
<lb/>I am annoyed by a dishonest guest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur answered: <q>Go and fetch a slave.
<lb/>He will remove the droppings fast enough,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>And I will give him gold for sweeping up,
<lb/>And bearing off, the refuse to the plain.</q>
<lb/><q>No one have I,</q> he said, <q>to sweep up refuse,
<lb/>Take it away, and fling it in the ditch.
<lb/>Break not thy promises deceitfully;
<lb/>Let me not say that thou hast played the knave.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, hearing, took another course.
<lb/>He had a dainty handkerchief of silk
<lb/>Inside his boot, all musk and spicery;
<lb/>He took it out and put therein the droppings,
<pb n="19"/>
<lb/>Then flung them all together in the ditch.
<lb/>Away went Baraham and snatched it up
<lb/>While Shah Bahram stood dazed. <q>Oho!</q> said he,
<lb/><q>Thou scrupulous! If the great king shall hear
<lb/>Of all thy nobleness he will secure thee
<lb/>From want in this world, and will set thee high
<lb/>Among the chiefs.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He went back to his palace,
<lb/>And all night long was planning what to do.
<lb/>Within his halls thought banished all repose,
<lb/>He laughed himself but kept the matter close.
</p>

<head>§ 5 How Bahram bestowed the Wealth of Bardham upon Lambak</head>

<div>
<p>
<lb/>Next morn he donned his crown and held an audience,
<lb/>Then called to him Lambak, the water-carrier,
<lb/>Who came before him with enfolded arms.
<lb/>They brought withal and quickly Baraham,
<lb/>That curst, malicious Jew. When he arrived
<lb/>They made him sit and called an honest man,
<lb/>To whom the Shah said: <q>Take some baggage-beasts
<lb/>And, acting with the utmost honesty,
<lb/>Go to the house of Baraham forthwith,
<lb/>And look thou bring what thou find’st hoarded there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>That honest man went to the Jew’s abode.
<lb/>The house was all brocade, dinars, and raiment,
<lb/>All carpetings, and draperies, and hoards.
<lb/>There was a caravanserai attached,
<lb/>And no room too on earth for all the goods—
<lb/>Gold, silver, every gem, and, on the top
<lb/>Of every bag, a lofty diadem.
<pb n="20"/>

<lb/>The archmage’s reckoning failed. He called for camels,


<lb/>A thousand from the desert of Jahram,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1497"/>
<lb/>And packed the baggage but much still remained.<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>That good man drove apace the caravans,
<lb/>And, when the bells resounded from the court-gate,
<lb/>Went and informed the Shah: <q>As many gems
<lb/>Are here as in thy treasury, yet are left
<lb/>Two hundred ass-loads!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thought the Shah, amazed: <q>The Jew hath greatly toiled, but to what profit
<lb/>Since food hath failed him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Bestowed a hundred camel-loads of gold,
<lb/>Of drachms, of carpets, and things great and small
<lb/>Upon the water-carrier. Lambak
<lb/>Departed with his treasures. Then the Shah
<lb/>Called Baraham and said to him: <q>O thou
<lb/>Consorting in thy meanness with the dust!
<lb/>Dost tell me that thy prophet was long-lived,
<lb/>And yet bewail life’s superfluities?<note>If your prophet managed to live long on little so can you.</note>
<lb/>A horseman came and quoted me this saw,
<lb/>Out of the sayings of the past, which saith:
<lb/>‘Hath will enjoy and Hath not withereth.’
<lb/>So now withdraw thy grasping hand and watch
<lb/>Henceforth the enjoyment of the water-carrier.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then to that vile Jew of the synagogue
<lb/>He spake at large of droppings, handkerchief
<lb/>Gold-woven, and tiles, bestowed upon the knave
<lb/>Four drachms, and said: <q>Take this as capital;
<lb/>No more befitteth thee. To mendicants
<lb/>Thy wealth, to thee thy head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave the poor
<lb/>All that there was. The Jew departed wailing.
<lb/>The Shah gave up the house to plundering;
<lb/>'Twas well that other folk should have their fling.
</p>

<pb n="21"/>
</div>

<head>§ 6 How Bahram slew Lions and forbade Wine-drinking</head>

<div>
<p>
<lb/>He found employment for the hunting cheetah,
<lb/>Bestirred him and was minded for the chase.
<lb/>He mounted him upon a speedy steed,
<lb/>And pricked forth to the plain with hawk on hand.
<lb/>He found a wood that was a rich man’s seat.
<lb/>It was as verdurous as Paradise,
<lb/>And there was neither man nor beast in sight.
<lb/>He said: <q>Here lions should be found. No man
<lb/>Of prudence would sleep here.</q>
<lb/>He entered in,
<lb/>And rode about surveying it. He saw
<lb/>A lion there and that he must employ
<lb/>The scimitar. He shouted at the beast
<lb/>And, when it bravely charged him, rode outside
<milestone unit="calced" n="1498"/>
<lb/>The forest, blazed forth like Azargashasp,

<lb/>And, when the lion followed, strung his bow,
<lb/>A hero he, shot and transfixed the creature
<lb/>Through side and heart; that of the lioness
<lb/>Grew all a-flame, and she too charged Bahram,
<lb/>Roared out and clawed at him. The cavalier
<lb/>Smote with his sword her loins, and that brave beast
<lb/>Gave up the fight. Now in the wood there dwelt
<lb/>A country magnate, a God-fearing man,
<lb/>Whose name was Mihr Bidad. That sword-stroke charmed him.
<lb/>With sweet words on his tongue that old man left
<lb/>The wood, drew near the Shah, blessed him, did reverence,
<lb/>And said: <q>O famous chief! may fortune’s star
<lb/>Be at thy beck. A rural chief am I,
<lb/>O holy one! and owner of this march,
<pb n="22"/>
<lb/>This tilth, and mansion, ox and ass and sheep.
<lb/>Those lions caused me sorrow and despair;
<lb/>Now by thy hand, thy thumb-ring, and thy hilt
<lb/>God hath removed them. Tarry in our wood,<note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>And I will bring thee milk and wine and honey.
<lb/>I have as many lambs as thou canst want
<lb/>With trees fruit-laden that will furnish shade.</q>


</p>
<p>

<lb/>The Shah alighted and surveyed the forest;
<lb/>He found it verdurous, supplied with streams,
<lb/>And fitted for a young man’s dwelling-place.
<lb/>Then Mihr Bidéd went and fetched minstrelsy
<lb/>As well as divers of the village-chiefs.
<lb/>He slaughtered numbers of fat sheep and came,
<lb/>Gold cup in hand. When they had eaten bread
<lb/>The servants set on cups of wine with roses
<lb/>And fenugreek. The host quaffed one and gave
<lb/>Another to Bahram and took all pains
<lb/>To set him at his ease. When Mihr Biddd
<lb/>Grew blithe with wine he said: <q>Fair-fortuned hero!
<lb/>Thou favourest the Shah or the full moon
<lb/>At midnight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram: <q>Yea, that is so;
<lb/>The King of kings designed this face of mine.
<lb/>He maketh as He willeth, waxing not
<lb/>Nor waning, but if I am like the Shah
<lb/>Then I have given thee this seat and forest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>This said, he mounted, sought his pleasure-palace,
<lb/>Bemused, but sleepless in the garth all night
<lb/>Romanced about the lips of the beloved.
</p><p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1499"/>

<lb/>Next morn he took his seat and called for wine.
<lb/>The captains of the host approached rejoicing,
<lb/>And with the others came a noble man
<lb/>Who from his village brought a gift of fruit—
<lb/>Pomegranate, apple, quince, in camel-loads,
<lb/>And posies fashioned for imperial use.
</p>

<pb n="23"/>

<p>
<lb/>The world-lord, seeing him, saluted him,
<lb/>And seated him among the paladins.
<lb/>The lord that brought the posies and the fruit
<lb/>Bore in the olden tongue the name Kirwi.
<lb/>While he was joying to behold the Shah,
<lb/>The nobles, and the banquet-hall, he spied
<lb/>A crystal goblet filled with wine which proved
<lb/>His ruin. Reaching out among the lords
<lb/>He grasped it, rose, and drank <q>The king of kings!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then cried: <q>A toper I, my name Kirwi.
<lb/>Since in the presence of the king of kings
<lb/>I drain the goblet I will drain again.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>This said, he drained the goblet seven times,
<lb/>And distanced all the other revellers.
<lb/>Then by the Shah’s permission he departed
<lb/>To learn if he could bear off all that wine.
<lb/>He left the jovial city for the plain,
<lb/>And when the wine was warm within his breast
<lb/>He galloped from among his retinue
<lb/>Toward the hills, dismounted, chose him out
<lb/>A quiet, shady spot, and slumbered. Came
<lb/>A black crow from the mountains and pecked out
<lb/>His eyes! His escort following found him dead
<lb/>And eyeless with his roadster by his side,
<lb/>And wailed o’er him and at such revelry.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram had wakened in his chamber
<lb/>A courtier came to him, and said: <q>A crow
<lb/>Hath pecked out both Kirwi’s bright eyes while he
<lb/>Was lying drunk among the hills.</q>
<lb/>The world-lord
<lb/>Grew pale of cheek thereat and sorrowful,
<lb/>And from the palace proclamation issued:—
<lb/><q>Ye men of name endowed with Grace and sense!
<lb/>Wine is a thing forbidden in the world
<lb/>Alike to paladin and artisan.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus passed a year while all held wine forbidden
<pb n="24"/>


<lb/>E’en when the Shah himself held revelry,
<lb/>Or called for tales from old time legendry.
</p>
</div>

<head>§ 7 The Story of the young Shoemaker, and how Bahram allowed Wine again</head>

<div>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1500"/>
<p>
<lb/>Now at that time a young shoemaker wedded
<lb/>A virtuous wife, rich and of good repute,
<lb/>But failed in nuptial duty, and his mother
<lb/>Lamented bitterly his grievous case.
<lb/>Howbeit she had some wine in store. She took
<lb/>Her son to her own house and bade the youth:
<lb/><q>Drink seven cups to hearten thee. Perchance
<lb/>Thou mayest break this stubborn seal to-night.
<lb/>How can a woollen mattock mine in stone?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He quaffed cups seven or eight, and verily
<lb/>His feet and hide waxed strong. The cups had made
<lb/>The young man confident; he came, achieved
<lb/>His purpose, and then went back to his mother
<lb/>In high delight thereat, and thus it chanced:
<lb/>A lion of the Shah’s had broken loose,
<lb/>And came along the road. Now at the time
<lb/>The shoemaker was still in drink—a sea
<lb/>That made his fingers thumbs. He ran, bestrode
<lb/>The roaring lion, and then reaching out
<lb/>He clutched its ears. The lion had been fed;
<lb/>The youth maintained his seat. Post-haste the keeper
<lb/>Came running after them, a chain in one hand,
<lb/>A lasso in the other. He beheld
<lb/>A shoemaker upon the lion’s back,
<lb/>Perched there like some bold rider on an ass,
<lb/>Ran to the palace-gate, came unabashed
<lb/>Before the Shah, and told about the wonder


<pb n="25"/>
<lb/>That he had seen, with his own eyes, and none
<lb/>Beside had heard. The world-lord all amazed
<lb/>Called the high priest and chiefs, and bade the former:
<lb/><q>See what the stock of this shoemaker is.
<lb/>If he shall prove a paladin by birth
<lb/>’Tis well, for courage fitteth paladins.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They sought and asked his mother: <q>Is his rank
<lb/>Above his station?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When the talk grew long
<lb/>She hurried to the Shah and told him all,
<lb/>First doing her obeisance and exclaiming:
<lb/><q>Live happily till time shall be no more.
<lb/>This youth, who had not come to man’s estate,
<lb/>Must take himself a partner and keep house,
<lb/>And then prove impotent! His wife, she said:
<lb/>‘This weakling was self-sown!’ All privily
<lb/>I gave to him three cups of wine, and none
<lb/>In all the world was ware thereof. Forthwith
<milestone unit="calced" n="1501"/>
<lb/>It flushed his cheeks and made a man of him.
<lb/>Three cups of wine are his nobility;
<lb/>Who could imagine that the Shah would wish
<lb/>To hear thereof? Shoemaker was his granddad,
<lb/>And so is he, and not by birth above
<lb/>His trade.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah smiled on the crone, and said:
<lb/><q>This is no tale to hide.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He thus addressed
<lb/>The archmage: <q>Wine is now permissible,
<lb/>And we should drink thereof to his extent
<lb/>Who in his cups still can bestride a lion,
<lb/>And not be overthrown, but not to his
<lb/>Who lieth all dead-drunk upon the road
<lb/>What while some black crow pecketh out his eyes.</q>
<lb/>A proclamation went up from the gate:
<lb/><q>O paladins who wear the golden girdle!
<lb/>Drink wine in moderation, all of you!
<pb n="26"/>
<lb/>Considering the end when ye begin,
<lb/>And when the wine hath led you to delight
<lb/>Then go to sleep but not in helpless plight.</q>
</p>

</div>

<head>§ 8 How Riuzbih, Bahram’s High Priest, ruined a Village by a Stratagem and restored it</head>

<div>
<p>
<lb/>The third day at the dawn the Shah went forth,
<lb/>He and his men, to hunt upon the plain;
<lb/>Hurmuz, his minister, was on his left,
<lb/>And on his right the holy archimage.
<lb/>They told him tales, discoursing of Jamshid
<lb/>And Faridun.<note>See Vol. i. pp. 129 seq., 147 seq.</note> Before them were the hounds,
<lb/>The cheetahs, hawks, and falcons. Thus they shortened
<lb/>The tedious day. Bright Sol was high, but still
<lb/>They saw no trace of deer or onager,
<lb/>And so Bahram Gur, troubled by the heat,
<lb/>Turned back in dudgeon from the hunting-field.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He came upon a verdurous spot fulfilled
<lb/>With houses, men, and cattle. Many folk
<lb/>Came from the settlement to see the troops,
<lb/>But no man did obeisance. Thou hadst said:
<lb/><q>The earth hath tethered every ass of them!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch, vexed and overcome by heat,
<lb/>Had fixed upon that village for a halt.
<lb/>Its folk disgusted him, he viewed them not
<lb/>With favour, and in anger thus addressed
<lb/>The high priest: <q>What an ill-starred spot is this!
<lb/>Be it a lair for wild beasts and for game,
<lb/>And may its streams run pitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archimage,
<lb/>Who took this for an order, turned aside
<pb n="27"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1502"/>
<lb/>Toward the village and informed the folk:
<lb/><q>This verdant spot—all fruitage, men, and cattle—
<lb/>Hath greatly pleased Bahram, the king of kings,
<lb/>Who hath a new design respecting it.
<lb/>He raiseth all of you to noble rank
<lb/>To turn this pleasant village to a city.
<lb/>Here, lord and hireling, ye shall be all equal.
<lb/>Men, women, children, ye shall be all chiefs,
<lb/>Each of you be the master of the village.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>Glad shouts rose from that prosperous settlement
<lb/>Because the people were all lords alike.
<lb/>Thenceforth, man’s rede or woman’s, 'twas all one,
<lb/>And slave and hireling were their master’s peers.
<lb/>The village-youths, no longer checked by awe,
<lb/>Cut off their elders’ heads, then fell upon
<lb/>Each other and, where roads were not, shed blood.
<lb/>At that to-do folk fled incontinent.
<lb/>The helpless aged remained, but there remained not
<lb/>The implements of culture, goods, and crops.
<lb/>The settlement had ruin in its face,
<lb/>The trees were withered and the streams ran dry,
<lb/>The land and houses were all desolate,
<lb/>And shunned of man and beast. Now when a year
<lb/>Had passed and spring returned the monarch went
<lb/>A-hunting in those parts and reached that spot
<lb/>Erst populous and blithe, and saw the place
<lb/>O’erturned, trees withered, habitations waste,
<lb/>And not a man or beast throughout the march.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Thereat the Shah turned pale, the fear of God
<lb/>Came on him, he was grievously distressed,
<lb/>And thus addressed the archmage: <q>Wine is now permissible,
<lb/>And we should drink thereof to his extent

<lb/>Alack! this place so jocund once is ruined!
<lb/>Go to now and restore it with my treasures,
<lb/>And take such order that the folk henceforth
<lb/>Be scathless.</q></p>







<p>
<lb/>Going from the royal pesence
<pb n="28"/>
<lb/>The archmage sped forth to that scene of ruin.
<lb/>From street to street he hurried and at last
<lb/>Came on an old man unemployed. Dismounting
<lb/>He spake the elder fair, made him sit down
<lb/>Near by, and said to him: <q>Old, honoured sir!
<lb/>Who wrecked this district once so populous?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The old man answered thus: <q>Our monarch once
<lb/>Was passing through our parts, and thereupon
<lb/>There came to us a witless archimage,
<lb/>One of those useless people with big names,
<lb/>And said to us: ‘Ye all are chieftains here:
<lb/>See that ye pay respect to nobody.
<lb/>Be masters, all of you, both men and women,
<lb/>And great among the great.’ Such were his words,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1503"/>
<lb/>And all the township was convulsed thereat,
<lb/>All rapine, murder, stick! May God befriend him
<lb/>In like proportion, may grief, death, and hardship
<lb/>Ne’er stale with him. Our case is growing worse,
<lb/>And such that folk must weep for us.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Ruzbih,
<lb/>Grieved for that old man, asked: <q>Who is your chief?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The other answered: <q>Who will have a place
<lb/>Where there is naught excepting seed and grass?</q>
<lb/>Ruzbih replied: <q>Be thou the governor,
<lb/>Be as the crown upon the head in all things,
<lb/>Make requisition from the world-lord’s treasures
<lb/>For money, oxen, asses, grain, and produce;
<lb/>Bring to the village all the unemployed;
<lb/>They all are subjects, thou alone art chief,
<lb/>And curse no more the ancient archimage,
<lb/>Who spake not as he would in what he said.
<lb/>If thou wilt have assistants from the court
<lb/>I will dispatch them. Ask for what thou wilt.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The elder joyed to hear this and was freed
<lb/>From longsome grief. He hied him home forthwith,
<pb n="29"/>
<lb/>Brought others to his Cistern and began
<lb/>To people and apportion out the lands.
<lb/>They borrowed from their neighbours ox and ass,
<lb/>And furnished all the plain. He and his settlers
<lb/>Worked hard and planted many trees on all sides,
<lb/>And, when his labour had restored one piece,
<lb/>The hearts of those that dwelt therein rejoiced.
<lb/>Those that had fled, their heart’s blood in their eyes,
<lb/>Flocked back on hearing of that restoration,
<lb/>And of the toils of that white-headed chief,
<lb/>And reinstated street and water-course,
<lb/>While fowl, ox, ass, and sheep all multiplied
<lb/>Upon the cultured parts, and everywhere
<lb/>Folk planted trees till that waste spot became
<lb/>Like Paradise. The third year he restored
<lb/>The town: the chief was blessed in all his labours.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When jocund spring came round the Shah went forth
<lb/>Upon the plain a-hunting with Ruzbih,
<lb/>The high priest. When the pair drew near the hamlet
<lb/>Bahram Gur suddenly beheld the world
<lb/>All crops and cattle, lofty mansions rose,
<lb/>And all the township thronged with sheep and oxen.
<lb/>'Twas all streams, pleasances, and growing crops,
<lb/>And fenugreek and tulips filled the hills,
<lb/>Whereon roamed sheep and lambs, for hill and dale
<lb/>Had grown to be a paradise. The Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1504"/>
<lb/>Said to the high priest: <q>O Ruzbih! what didst thou
<milestone unit="calced" n="1504"/>
<lb/>To make this verdant village waste and scatter
<lb/>Its men and beasts, and what hast thou dispensed
<lb/>In thus restoring it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The high priest answered:
<lb/><q>This ancient seat was ruined by a word,
<lb/>And by a word restored, to please the Shah.
<lb/>He bade me: ‘Take thou treasure and dinars,
<lb/>And make this verdant spot a wilderness,’
<lb/>But I feared God and blame from great and small.
<pb n="30"/>

<lb/>When friends, though one in heart, are two in aim
<lb/>’Tis ruin, as I have perceived, to both;
<lb/>So when there are two rulers in a state
<lb/>Their land will be o’erturned. I went and said
<lb/>Thus to the elders of this settlement:
<lb/>‘O men! there is no ruler over you
<lb/>From this time forth, but women, children, slaves,
<lb/>Hirelings and husbandmen, are lords alike.’
<lb/>When those who had been underlings became
<lb/>Lords too the nobles’ heads were all brought low,
<lb/>And all the place was ruined by a word.
<lb/>Thus was I far removed from all reproach,
<lb/>And apprehension of God’s chastisement.
<lb/>Thereafter, when the Shah had ruth on them,
<lb/>I went and pointed out another course;
<lb/>I made a wise, old man and eloquent,
<lb/>A man of leading and informed, the ruler.
<lb/>He laboured and restored the waste, rejoicing
<lb/>His subjects’ hearts. When one man ruled, the course
<lb/>Was good, prosperity increased, ill waned.
<lb/>I, unobserved, had shown them what was bad,
<lb/>And opened afterward the way of God.
<lb/>Discourse is better than fine-watered gems
<lb/>When ’tis employed aright. Let wisdom be
<lb/>The Shah, the tongue the paladin, if thou
<lb/>Wouldst have thy spirit easy. May thy heart
<lb/>Be glad for aye and free from wile and waste.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing, cried: <q>Well done, Ruzbih!
<lb/>Thou’rt worthy of a crown!</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur gave
<lb/>That old man worshipful and prescient
<lb/>A purse all filled with gold dinars. For him
<lb/>A robe of honour too they fashioned
<lb/>Of royal stuffs, and cloud-ward raised his head.

<div><head>§ 9 How Bahram married a Country-miller’s Daughters</head>


<p>
<lb/>Another week the monarch of the world
<lb/>Went forth to hunt with lords and archimages,
<lb/>Prepared to spend a month upon the chase,
<lb/>To revel with his meiny, and to take
<lb/>Illimitable game on waste and mountain.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1505"/>
<lb/>He and his escort reached in merry pin
<lb/>A town. The night came on, and all was dark.
<lb/>The chiefs dismissed the escort and recited
<lb/>Tales of the Shahs. He saw afar a fire,
<lb/>Such as Shahs kindle on Bahman’s high day.<note>The day Bahman of the month Bahman was a time of festivity.</note>
<lb/>The king of kings gazed at the light and spied
<lb/>A pleasant village with a mill before it,
<lb/>Where sat the village-chiefs, while all the maidens,
<lb/>Each with a crown of roses on her head,
<lb/>Were feasting by themselves beside the fire.
<lb/>The minstrels sat about, the maidens sang
<lb/>Tales of the royal wars, and every one
<lb/>Began to tell a story in her turn.
<lb/>They all were moon-faced, all had locks a-curl,
<lb/>All were sweet-spoken, and all savoured musk.
<lb/>They sat ranked on the grass and close before
<lb/>The mill-door, singing, with a posy each,
<lb/>And half bemused with wine and merriment.
<lb/>Then from that scene of revel rose a cry,
<lb/>And one exclaimed: <q>The toast of Shah Bahram!
<lb/>He hath Grace, stature, mien, and love. Before him
<lb/>The rolling sphere upstandeth. Thou wouldst say:
<lb/>‘His face distilleth wine, the scent of musk
<lb/>Proceedeth from his hair.’ He only hunteth
<lb/>The lion and the onager, and so
<lb/>Folk title him ‘Bahram Gur.’</q>
</p>

<pb n="32"/>

<p>
<lb/>This he heard,
<lb/>And rode toward them. Drawing near the girls
<lb/>He scanned the plain, beheld it filled with Moons,
<lb/>And saw that he should stop short of the city.
<lb/>He bade, and from the road cup-bearers came,
<lb/>Provided wine and boon-companions,
<lb/>And handed him a crystal cup. Meanwhile
<lb/>Four of the girls, those chief in rank, came forth—
<lb/>One Mushkinab,<note>Mushkinaz in C. and P. Mushkinab means "Pure Musk"; Mushkinak is a speoies of bird; Naztab is "Charmer,"  and Susanak “Little
Lily.”</note> the others Mushkinak,
<lb/>Naztab, and Sasanak. With cheeks like spring,
<lb/>With stately mien, and hand in hand, they went
<lb/>Before the Shah and sang about Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, the wise and prosperous.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur asked, for they perturbed his heart:
<lb/><q>Who are ye,<note>Reading with P.</note> rose-cheeked? Wherefore is this fire?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>One said: <q>O cavalier of cypress-height,
<lb/>So like a king in everything! our father
<milestone unit="calced" n="1506"/>
<lb/>Is an old miller who is shooting game
<lb/>Upon this mountain and will come anon
<lb/>Since it is night, and he can see no longer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>With that the miller and his men came bringing
<lb/>Their quarry. When his eyes fell on Bahram Gur
<lb/>He rubbed his face upon the dust and bore him
<lb/>With awe and reverence. The Shah bade give
<lb/>That old man just arrived a golden cup,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Why keepest thou these four
<lb/>With sunny faces thus? Is it not time
<lb/>For them to wed?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The old man offered praise,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is no husband for them; they
<lb/>Are maidens still and pure in chastity,
<lb/>But that is all the property they have,
<lb/>And this is all that I can say for them.</q>
</p>

<pb n="33"/>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram said: <q>Give me all the four, and henceforth
<lb/>Regard them not as daughters.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Quoth the ancient:
<lb/><q>Do not as thou hast said, O cavalier!
<lb/>No cups have we, no land, no crops, no silver,
<lb/>No mansion, ox, and ass.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur said:
<lb/><q>'Tis well, for I would have them portionless.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller said: <q>The four shall be thy wives,
<lb/>The handmaids of the dust within thy chambers.
<lb/>Thine eye hath seen their good points and their ill,
<lb/>And, seeing, hath approved.</q>
<lb/>Bahram Gur said:
<lb/><q>From holy God, the All-giver, I accept them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake and rose. Steeds neighed upon the plain.
<lb/>He bade the eunuchs of his escort bear
<lb/>Those Idols to the royal women’s house,
<lb/>And through the night the troops filed o’er the waste.
<lb/>The miller marvelled, mused all night, and said:
<lb/><q>This moon-like lord so tall
<lb/>And masterful, how came he here by night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>She answered: <q>He perceived the fire from far,
<lb/>The noise the girls were making, and the sound
<lb/>Of minstrels, harp, and revelry.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller
<lb/>Said to his wife: <q>Advise me, O my spouse!
<lb/>If this affair will turn out well or ill?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>She answered: <q>It is all God’s providence.
<lb/>The man, on seeing them, asked not their race,
<lb/>Thought not of dowry. On earth’s face he sought
<lb/>For Moons and not for money or kings’ daughters.
<lb/>If idol-worshippers saw these in Chin
<lb/>There would be no more idol-worshipping!</q>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1507"/>
<lb/>Thus till above the Raven’s back the sun 
<lb/>Rose, and the world grew like a shining lamp,
<lb/>They talked at large of base and upright men,

<pb n="34"/>            

<lb/>But with the day the village-chief arrived,
<lb/>And said to that old man: <q>O brave of luck!<note>"O vaillant Rouzbeh." Mohl.</note>
<lb/>Good fortune visited thy couch last night!
<lb/>The verdant branches of thy tree bear fruit.
<lb/>One looked, beheld the merriment and fire,
<lb/>And, having turned his horse about, drew near;
<lb/>So now thy daughters have become his wives,
<lb/>And rest securely in his women’s house.
<lb/>By giving them such faces, hair, and carriage
<lb/>Thou didst prepare them for the Shah! Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, is now thy son-in-law!
<lb/>Henceforth thou wilt be famous through the realm.
<lb/>He hath bestowed upon thee all this province
<lb/>And march, so sorrow not, for thou hast 'scaped
<lb/>From cares and fears. Command. 'Tis thine to bid.
<lb/>We all of us are thralls and bound to thee;
<lb/>We all of us are subject to thee now,
<lb/>Are subject! Rather we are all thy slaves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The miller and his wife in their amaze
<lb/>Invoked God’s name. The village-chieftain said:
<lb/><q>Such locks as those and countenances too
<lb/>Would bring the sun from his fourth heaven to woo.</q>
</p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 10 How Bahram found the Treasures of Jamshid and bestowed them upon the Poor</head>
<p>
<lb/>Another week he went forth to the chase
<lb/>With favourites from the host and archimages.
<lb/>Swift as the wind there came a loyal liege
<lb/>With spade in hand and asking of the troops
<lb/>Where was Bahram, the Shah, amid the throng?
<lb/>An archimage replied: <q>What wilt thou? Speak.
<pb n="35"/>  
<lb/>Thou canst not see the monarch of the world.</q><note>Reading with P.</note>
<lb/>The man said: <q>Since I may see not his face
<lb/>I will speak not before his followers.</q>
</p>



<p>
<lb/>They brought before the Shah that seeker—one
<lb/>Both learned and eloquent—who seeing him
<lb/>Said: <q>I have words to speak to thee in private.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur turned his horse’s head aside,
<lb/>And rode some distance from his followers’ sight.
<lb/>Then said the man: <q>O world-possessing Shah!
<lb/>Thou must observe my words. A countryman
<lb/>Am I, and landlord here. I own the soil,
<lb/>The homestead, and the crops. I was engaged
<lb/>In making water-courses on my land
<lb/>To benefit my property, and when
<lb/>There was much water, and the stream ran strong,
<lb/>In one place there was formed an orifice,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1508"/>
<lb/>A wondrous clamour reached mine ears, and I
<lb/>Came crying out in terror of my life.
<lb/>The clash of cymbals issued from the stream—
<lb/>A sound denoting treasure.</q><note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 250.</note>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>Bahram Gur weal and saw a plain all verdure,
<lb/>And watered, bade bring labourers with spades
<lb/>From far, and lighted from his steed. They pitched
<lb/>His tent among the crops. Night came. The warriors
<lb/>Lit lamps and everywhere enkindled fires.
<lb/>Now when the sun set up above the deep
<lb/>Its banner, burnishing the violet air,
<lb/>The workmen mustered from all sides, as though
<lb/>A mighty army, and began to dig.
<lb/>That portion of the plain was excavate,
<lb/>And, as the workers wearied, there appeared
<lb/>Out of the dust a mount-like place—a mansion
<lb/>Of mortar and burnt brick—like Paradise.
<lb/>They plied their picks; far down a doorway showed.
</p>        
<pb n="36"/>
<p>
<lb/>An archmage, seeing, entered by the door,
<lb/>He and another uninvited guest.
<lb/>They found a single chamber long and wide,
<lb/>And many cubits high. Within it stood
<lb/>Two buffaloes of gold and, fronting them,
<lb/>A golden laver strewn with emeralds
<lb/>And rubies mixed. They seemed two Signs of Taurus,
<lb/>Were hollow, and were filled up with pomegranates,
<lb/>With apples, and with quinces that contained
<lb/>Fine-watered pearls, each like a water-drop.
<lb/>The buffaloes had jewel-eyes, and heads
<lb/>Decayed with age. Ranked round them there were
<lb/>lions
<lb/>And onagers, some having ruby eyes,
<lb/>And others crystal. There were golden pheasants
<lb/>And peacocks, with their breasts and eyes all gems.
<lb/>The minister, whose wisdom was a crown
<lb/>Upon the moon, on seeing that spectacle,
<lb/>Went to the Shah and cried excitedly:—
<lb/><q>Arise. Enough to dower thy treasuries
<lb/>Is here! A chamber filled with precious stones
<lb/>Is manifest, whose key high heaven hath kept!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>His lord said: <q>One of counsel and of might
<lb/>Would write his name upon his treasures. See
<lb/>Whose name is there and when they were amassed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On hearing this the high priest went and saw
<lb/>The impress of the signet of Jamshid
<lb/>Upon the buffaloes, and notified
<lb/>The monarch of the world: <q>I have beheld,
<lb/>And 'Shah Jamshid' is on the buffaloes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1509"/>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>O high priest in all regards
<lb/>More learned than sages! wherefore make mine own
<lb/>The treasures that Jamshid laid up of yore?
<lb/>May nothing e’er be added to my wealth
<lb/>Unless by justice and the scimitar.
<lb/>Bestow the whole upon the poor. God grant
<pb n="37"/>
<lb/>That no mishap befall us. For my troops
<lb/>No share is requisite, our valour openeth
<lb/>The earth to us. As is the use of kings
<lb/>'Tis needful that we count up all this wealth,
<lb/>Sell all the gems for cash, and then assemble
<lb/>From desert and from settlement the widows,
<lb/>The orphans, and the impoverished men of name—
<lb/>Those lost to aspiration, fame, and ease—
<lb/>Then take the sum of such, including those
<lb/>That, troubled by their debts, should have a share,
<lb/>And give to them the money and the goods
<lb/>To assoil Jamshid the world-lord’s soul, but I
<lb/>Am youthful still, and sound in wind and limb;
<lb/>Why should I seek his treasures? Let one tenth
<lb/>Be for the finder, who sought out the Shah,
<lb/>But never let him hope for joy hereafter
<lb/>That beareth off the cerecloth from Jamshid.
<lb/>To compass toil in consort with my troops,
<lb/>And treasure and renown from Rum and Chin,
<lb/>That is for me and for my steed, Shabdiz,
<lb/>And for my trenchant scimitar. No shifts,
<lb/>Or shirks, for me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He went back to the treasure
<lb/>Won by his sweat and toil, assembled all
<lb/>The warriors of the realm, and gave his troops
<lb/>A whole year’s pay. He held a feast that spring,
<lb/>Adorned his hall of jewelled tracery,
<lb/>And, when the red wine shone in crystal cups,
<lb/>And he himself was jocund and right glad,
<lb/>He thus harangued his friends: <q/> Exalted ones,
<lb/>Who know the token of the throne of kings!
<lb/>Down from Hushang as far as famed Naudar,
<lb/>Who was a memory of Faridin,
<lb/>And on again right up to Kai Kubad,
<lb/>Who placed the crown of greatness on his head,
<lb/>See who of all these mighty men is left,
<pb n="38"/>
<lb/>And who remaineth to applaud their justice ?
<lb/>Now, since the circle of their years is cut,
<lb/>Their reputation is their monument,
<lb/>Which saith that this had spirit, that had not,
<lb/>And one doth blame them, and another praise.
<lb/>We all shall pass in turn, and not to walk
<milestone unit="calced" n="1510"/>
<lb/>The world for ill is well. Why should I need
<lb/>The treasure of those gone ? Why should my heart
<lb/>Expand toward dinars ? I will not set it
<lb/>Upon this Wayside Inn, or make my boast
<lb/>Of crown, or clutch at treasure. If the days
<lb/>Pass in delight why should the wise eat grief ?
<lb/>Whene’er a liege of mine, a countryman
<lb/>Or courtier, shall complain of mine oppression
<lb/>Then may my head and crown and treasure perish.<q/>
<lb/>There was an ancient man, hight Mahiyar,
<lb/>Whose years had reached eight score and four. He
<lb/>On hearing this, and spake thus: <q/> O just lord !
<lb/>Tales have we heard of Faridun, Jamshid,
<lb/>And others more or less renowned, but none
<lb/>Hath heard of Shah like thee—the lowly’s hope,
<lb/>The Glory of the great—and were the sea
<lb/>Large as thy heart ’twould rise in waves of gems,
<lb/>For from thy soul the radiance of Surush
<lb/>Proceedeth, dwarfing all a wise man’s wit.
<lb/>Thou hast so lavished treasure in the world
<lb/>That no one great or small hath seen the like.
<lb/>When men spake of the era of Jamshid,
<lb/>And of the treasure of the buffaloes,
<lb/>None wotted where it was—beneath the dust,
<lb/>Or in the dragon’s breath—but having found it
<lb/>Thou didst not look thereon, for thou didst scorn
<lb/>This Wayside Hostelry. Good sooth! no king
<lb/>Hath seen, nor will a hundred see, such jewels
<lb/>As these in any sea, yet these and all
<pb n="39"/>
<lb/>The buffaloes and onagers thou gavest
<lb/>Without exception to the poor! May crown
<lb/>And girdle never lack thee. Health be thine,
<lb/>Be victor thou and fortune’s favourite.
<lb/>The ink would blacken many a royal roll
<lb/>To tell this tale and yet not reach the end.
<lb/>Thou being gone thy name will live in praise
<lb/>When folk recount the story of thy days.<q/></p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 11 How Bahram, returning from Hunting, went to the House of a Merchant and departed displeased</head>

<p>
<lb/>One day, another week, he went to hunt,
<lb/>When indisposed, and took his bow and arrows.
<lb/>The plain grew sultry with the blazing sun.
<lb/>He came back from his hunting leisurely,
<lb/>And reached a merchant’s house, to whom he said,
<lb/>On looking round and seeing none beside :
<lb/>“Canst give us lodging since thou wilt not find us
<lb/>A trouble ? ”
<milestone unit="calced" n="1511"/>
<lb/>Having helped him to dismount
<lb/>The merchant found a place for him. The Shah,
<lb/>Complaining of the colic, gave the merchant
<lb/>Some drachms, and said: “ Toast some old cheese
<lb/>with almonds.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The merchant did not do as he was asked,
<lb/>Not having almonds by him, but, at night-fall
<lb/>And at his leisure, got a hot roast fowl,
<lb/>And served it to Bahram upon a tray,
<lb/>Who said : “ I asked thee for old cheese, besought thee
<lb/>To bring it, and thou hast not brought it me
<lb/>Although I gave thee drachms and had complained
<lb/>Of colic.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Said the merchant : “ Foolish fellow !
<pb n="40"/>
<lb/>Thy soul is starving through thy lack of wit.
<lb/>Since I have brought to thee this hot roast fowl
<lb/>Mere shame should stay thee asking aught beside.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram thereat ceased longing for old cheese.
<lb/>Grieved at his words he ate, referring not
<lb/>To what had passed. When it was sleeping-time
<lb/>He slept and said naught further to the merchant.
<lb/>Now when the sun rose o’er the heaving deep,
<lb/>And when the Cloak pitch-hued had disappeared,
<lb/>The wealthy merchant said to his apprentice :—
<lb/>“O simpleton ! why didst thou buy a fowl
<lb/>Not worth a drachm for more and wrong me 50 ?
<lb/>Had’t been a proper fowl then he and I
<lb/>Had fallen not out last night, or hadst thou spent
<lb/>A quarter of a drachm in buying cheese
<lb/>He would have been to me like milk and water
<lb/>To-day.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The apprentice answered : <q>Tis all one.
<lb/>Know that the fowl is at my charge. Be thou
<lb/>And he my guests, so quarrel not with me
<lb/>About the bird.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram arose
<lb/>From pleasant sleep he sought his docile steed
<lb/>To saddle it and go back to his palace,
<lb/>And from his palace raise his crown to Saturn.
<lb/>The apprentice, seeing him, said to Bahram :—
<lb/><q>Give to thy slave thy company to-day.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah returned, sat down again, and marvelled
<lb/>At fortune. Then the youth went out and fetched
<lb/>Two hundred almonds and addressed his master :—
<lb/><q>Bestir thee, sir ! and have these almonds toasted,
<lb/>Make ready too some cheese and some new bread,
<lb/>For such the cavalier asked yesterday,
<lb/>Bring food and spread the board.</q>
<lb/>He went before
<pb n="41"/>
<lb/>Bahram and said: “O cavalier! I bring thee
<milestone unit="calced" n="1512"/>
<lb/>All hot what yesterday thou didst require,
<lb/>And there is more to follow in due course.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thus saying he set off to the bazar,
<lb/>A different sort of purchaser. He bought
<lb/>More almonds, sugar, fowl, and lamb to make
<lb/>An ample meal, wine, saffron, musk, rose-water,
<lb/>And hurried home. He brought the board all spread
<lb/>With dainty meats. A sprightly youth was he
<lb/>And well disposed. The eating done, he brought
<lb/>Forth cups of wine, first serving king Bahram,
<lb/>And thus, till blithe and jocund, they proceeded
<lb/>From eating to the cup. The Shah addressed
<lb/>His entertainer thus: <q> Bahram will be
<lb/>Inquiring for me, but do ye drink on,
<lb/>Grow drunk, and budge not till ye prove yourselves
<lb/>Wine-worshippers.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then rubbing down and saddling
<lb/>Shabdiz he started, blithe with wine, for court,
<lb/>First saying to the merchant : <q/> Toil not so
<lb/>In quest of gain, O thou that sellest dear !
<lb/>‘Thou wouldst have sold me for a quarter drachm
<lb/>Yestreen, sewn up the eyes of thine apprentice
<lb/>Because he bought a fowl above the price,
<lb/>And have put me within the dragon’s maw.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He spake and sped back to his royal seat.
<lb/>Now when the sun displayed its crown in heaven
<lb/>The guardian of the world sat on his throne
<lb/>Of ivory and bade the chamberlain
<lb/>Seek out the merchant and conduct him thither
<lb/>With his apprentice. One of them was glad,
<lb/>The other glum. Bahram, on seeing the apprentice,
<lb/>Made much of him and seated him rejoicing
<lb/>Among the lords. They brought to him a purse,
<lb/>And made his awe-gloomed spirit like the moon.
<lb/>Then to the merchant said Bahram : <q> Know this:
<pb n="42"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1513"/>
<lb/>Thou shalt be slave for life to thine apprentice,
<lb/>And, further, pay him twice in every month
<lb/>Three score drachms from thy savings. With thy goods
<lb/>He shall be entertainer and make laugh
<lb/>The hearts of noble men.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then to the high priest :—
<lb/><q>The king that disregardeth this world’s doings,
<lb/>How can he know what man is truly great,
<lb/>Or how discern the evil from the good?</q>
<lb/>So now, O sage that seekest wisdom’s way,
<lb/>If thou must have a saw hear what I say :—
<lb/>Avoid all avarice if man thou be,
<lb/>Or be indeed below humanity.<q/>
</p>
</div>
<div><head>§ 12 How Bahram slew a Dragon and went to a Yokel’s House</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram abode a season with his lords,
<lb/>With sparkling wine, with cup, and minstrelsy.
<lb/>Spring came, the ground seemed Paradise, the air
<lb/>Sowed tulips on earth’s face, all tracts grew full
<lb/>Of game, and in the brooks the waters seemed
<lb/>Like wine and milk. The deer and onager
<lb/>Paced in the dales or clustered on the sward,
<lb/>The blackbirds haunted all the river-banks,
<lb/>And all around them bent pomegranate-blooms.
<lb/>‘Tis long, the nobles said to Shah Bahram Gar,
<lb/>Since we have hunted onager.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He answered :—
<lb/><q>Choose we a thousand horsemen from the host,
<lb/>And let them bring the cheetahs and the hawks,

<pb n="43"/>
<lb/>The falcons and the noble peregrines,
<lb/>Go to Turan and pass a month in hunting.</q></p>    


<p>
<lb/>The royal hunter went. He found the world
<lb/>All hues and scent. His gallant chieftains swept it
<lb/>For onager, gazelle, and mountain-sheep—
<lb/>A labour that extended o’er two days—
<lb/>What while Bahram had wine in hand; the third,
<lb/>When Sol illumed its crown, when earth grew golden,
<lb/>And hill and stream became as ivory,
<lb/>The valiant Shah went to the chase and saw
<lb/>A dragon like a lion. From its head
<lb/>Hair hung down to the ground, and it had breasts
<lb/>Like those of women. Then Bahram Gar strung
<lb/>His bow and shot forthwith a poplar arrow
<lb/>Against the dragon’s chest. He shot another
<lb/>Straight at its head, and gore and venom flowed
<lb/>Adown its front. The king dismounted, drew
<lb/>His sword, and carved up all the dragon’s breast.
<lb/>It had gulped down a youth and frozen him
<lb/>In blood and bane. Bahram bewailed him sorely
<lb/>What while the venom blinded his own eyes.
<lb/>He took the corpse out of the dragon’s maw,
<lb/>Ne’er may its head and breast unite again.
<lb/>He rode off dizzied, suffering, and longing
<lb/>For sleep and water, reached a settlement,
<lb/>Arriving at a house-door from the waste,
<lb/>And saw a woman shouldering a pitcher.
<lb/>She veiled her face from him. He said to her :—
<lb/>“Can I lodge here or must I toil on still ?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She said: “Brave horseman! treat this house as thine.”
<lb/>On hearing this he rode his courser in.
<lb/>His hostess called her husband. “Bring a wisp,”
<lb/>She said, “and rub his steed. At feeding-time
<lb/>Feed from the sack.”
<milestone unit="calced" n="1503"/>
<lb/>She went to her own chamber,
<pb n="44"/>
<lb/>Swept out the house and laid down mat and pillow,
<lb/>With blessings on Bahram, went to the cistern,
<lb/>Drew water, and berated to herself
<lb/>Her spouse the while: “The fool will ne’er bestir
<lb/>Himself on seeing some one in the house.
<lb/>This is not women’s work, but for my part
<lb/>I, soldier-like, can only grin and bear it!”
<lb/>She brought and spread the board with vinegar
<lb/>And salad, bread and curds. Went Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And bathed his face, for he had been o’erwrought
<lb/>In fighting with that dragon. So he ate
<lb/>A little, then lay down and groaned, his face
<lb/>Concealed beneath a kerchief made in Chin.
<lb/>The woman, when she woke, said to her spouse:—
<lb/>“O knave with unwashed face! thou shouldest slay
<lb/>A lamb because this cavalier is great,
<lb/>And of the royal seed, hath kingly bearing,
<lb/>And moon-like Grace, and he is like to none
<lb/>Save Shah Bahram.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Her mean spouse said to her:—
<lb/>“Why such to-do? Thou hast no salted meat,
<lb/>No fire-wood, and no bread, and spinnest not
<lb/>A-nights as others do. When thou hast killed
<lb/>A lamb, and he—this cavalier—hath eaten
<lb/>And gone, then go, buy, mingle with the throng;
<lb/>The winter, cold, and blast undoubtedly
<lb/>Will come on thee no less.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>So spake her spouse.
<lb/>She hearkened not, for she was good and wise,
<lb/>And in the end her husband slew a lamb
<lb/>At her entreaty for the cavalier.
<lb/>When it was slain she made a pot of broth,
<lb/>And lit a fire with half-burnt sticks, then brought
<lb/>The tray with eggs thereon and water-cresses,
<lb/>A roasted leg of lamb and everything
<lb/>That she had cooked. Bahram, when he had washed
<pb n="45"/>
<lb/>His hands, his dinner done, felt indisposed
<lb/>For slumber and still ailed. Now when the night
<lb/>Foregathered with the sun the woman fetched
<lb/>Wine and a harp. “O woman of few words!”
<lb/>The Shah said, “tell to me some old-world tale
<lb/>That while thou art reciting I may quaff
<lb/>To chase away my pain and cares. I give thee
<lb/>Free speech about the Shah for praise or blame.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That woman of few words said: <q/>Yea, 'tis well,
<lb/>For he is first and last in everything.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram responded: <q/>He is so indeed,
<lb/>But he is just and good to nobody.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That dame of spirit said: <q/>O honest man!
<lb/>This place hath many folk and many homes,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1515"/>
<lb/>And always cavaliers are passing through
<lb/>From public offices and ministers.
<lb/>If one of them shall call a man a thief
<lb/>The accused will have much trouble afterward.
<lb/>The cavalier to compass some few drachms
<lb/>Will make the poor man's life a misery,
<lb/>Or one may smirch some honest woman's fame,
<lb/>And make her fall to folly. This is loss,
<lb/>Because the treasury is none the richer.
<lb/>This is our trouble with our Shah, the world-lord.<q/>
<lb/>The king grew full of thought at that account—
<lb/>How those in power were wronging his good name—
<lb/>And then the pious Shah thought with himself:—
<lb/>No one doth praise the just. Henceforward I
<lb/>Will play the tyrant for a while that love
<lb/>And justice may grow manifest from ill.<q/>
<lb/>Vexed by dark thoughts he passed a sleepless night,
<lb/>His heart allied to tyranny the while.
<lb/>Now when Sol rent its musky-scented veil,
<lb/>And showed its face in heaven, the woman left
<lb/>The house and bade her spouse: <q/>Bring pot and fire,
<lb/>And in the water put all kinds of grain
<pb n="46"/>

<lb/>Before the sun shall see it. Mind it well
<lb/>While I go milk the cow.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She brought the cow
<lb/>From pasture, got much grass, and threw it down
<lb/>Before her; then she tried the udders, crying:—
<lb/>In God's name who hath neither mate nor peer!<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>She found the udder milkless, and the heart
<lb/>Of that young hostess aged. She told her husband:—
<lb/>Good man! our monarch's heart hath changed in purpose,
<lb/>The world's king hath become tyrannical!
<lb/>A secret change came o'er his heart last night.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He said: <q/>What words are these? Why go and croak?<q/>
<lb/>She thus replied: <q/>My dear one! what I say
<lb/>Is sober truth, for when the Shah, the world-lord,
<lb/>Hath grown unjust the moon may shine not forth
<lb/>In heaven, the udders are dry, the musk-bags lose
<lb/>Their scent, adultery and guile are rampant,
<lb/>The tender heart becometh flinty, wolves
<lb/>Devour folk on the waste, the sage doth flee
<lb/>The fool, and eggs are addled 'neath the hens
<lb/>What time the Shah becometh tyrannous.
<lb/>The pasture of this cow had minished not,
<lb/>Her watering-place supplied her as before,
<lb/>Yet is her udder dry, her lowing changed.<q/>
<lb/>On hearing this the Shah forthwith repented,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1516"/>
<lb/>And prayed to God: <q/>O Thou who art supreme,
<lb/>Almighty, and the Arbiter of fortune!
<lb/>If e'er my heart shall turn away from justice
<lb/>Then be the throne of kings no longer mine.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That blesséd dame, who worshipped holy God,
<lb/>Tried with her hand the udder once again,
<lb/>She tried it in the Lord's name, saying thus:—
<lb/>Cause Thou the milk to flow.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The milk flowed forth.
<pb n="47"/>
<lb/>The good wife cried: <q/>O God, our Succourer!
<lb/>Thou hast recalled to justice the unjust,
<lb/>For, if not so, this virtue were not his.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Then said she to the master of the house:—
<lb/>The justice of the unjust is restored.
<lb/>Laugh and rejoice; this is the Maker's boon
<lb/>To us.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the porridge had been cooked,
<lb/>And man and wife had done that chare, the good dame,
<lb/>And after her the master of the house,
<lb/>Who bare the tray, went to their guest. Upon it
<lb/>There was a bowl of porridge, oh! how good
<lb/>Had it been but some broth! The Shah ate somewhat,
<lb/>Then spake thus to that kindly dame: <q/>Take thou
<lb/>This whip outside and hang it where folk pass.
<lb/>Choose out a proper bough because the wind
<lb/>Must harm it not, then note the passers by
<lb/>With one eye on the whip.<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good-man went
<lb/>Forthwith, he hung the whip upon a tree,
<lb/>And kept his eye thereon a while. There came
<lb/>Innumerable troops along the road,
<lb/>And all that saw the whip there hailed Bahram.
<lb/>They lighted down before that lengthy whip,
<lb/>And passed saluting. <q/>'Tis the Shah, none else!<q/>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The good-man told his spouse. <q/>Naught but the throne
<lb/>Could fit a face like that!<q/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then full of awe
<lb/>Both ran to him and cried: <q>“O Shah! O great!
<pb n="47"/>
<lb/>O mighty one! O sage, high priest and world-lord!
<lb/>A humble woman and her gardener-spouse
<lb/>Have been thy poor hosts in this house. Withal
<lb/>They did not do their best. We ne’er suspected
<lb/>That ’twas the Shah, that such an one as he
<lb/>Would come to this place as a guest, would come
<lb/>To this poor home of ours.”</q>
<lb/>Bahram replied:—
<lb/><q>Good friend! I give to thee this march, the land,
<lb/>And village. Be thou ever hospitable;
<lb/>Be that, and give up garden-work.</q>
<lb/>He spoke,
<lb/>And laughing left the house, got on his steed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1517"/>
<lb/>Wind-footed, and from that poor village reached
<lb/>His jewelled halls. The nobles of Iran
<lb/>Went thither for the chase, three hundred strong,
<lb/>And each with thirty servants in his train
<lb/>Of Turkman, Raman, or of Persian strain.
</p>
<head>§ 13 How Bahram went to the Chase and espoused themDaughters of the Thane Barzin</head>

<p>
<lb/>The third day after this the Shah went forth
<lb/>With escort, the equipment for the chase,
<lb/>Ten camels all in housings of brocade
<lb/>With stirrups silver and with dossers gold,
<lb/>Ten camels with the Shah’s pavilion,
<lb/>And his brocaded seat. In front of these
<lb/>Were seven elephants which bare the throne
<lb/>Of turquoise dyed like Nile; its feet were all
<lb/>Of gold and crystal; ’twas the throne itself
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram Gur. Every swordsman there
<lb/>Had thirty pages who had golden belts
<lb/>And bridles, while a hundred camels served
<lb/>To bear the minstrels wearing massive crowns.
<lb/>The falconers had eight score hawks with them,
<lb/>And ten score noble peregrines and falcons.
<lb/>Among them there was one bird black of hue,
<pb n="49"/>
<lb/>More precious in the Shah’s eyes than the rest,
<lb/>With sable talons and with yellow beak,
<lb/>Like gold a-gleam on lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>They called it a tughral. Its eyes were like
<lb/>Two goblets full of blood. The Khan of Chin
<lb/>Had sent it with a throne and crown, with amber,
<lb/>A golden torque inlaid with emeralds,
<lb/>With two score armlets, and with thrice twelve earrings,
<lb/>Three hundred camel-loads of rarities
<lb/>Of Chin, and fifteen score of ruby signets.
<lb/>Behind the falconers they led eight score
<lb/>Of cheetahs for that Lustre of the world—
<lb/>The Shah—with jewelled torques and chains of gold.
<lb/>Thus came the king of kings upon the plain,
<lb/>And raised his crown o’er Jupiter. The sportsmen
<lb/>Made for the river whither used the Shah
<lb/>Auspiciously to fare each seventh year.
<lb/>As they drew near they found the river full
<lb/>Of water-fowl. He had the tabor beaten,
<lb/>And the tughral flew off. The imperious bird
<lb/>Was all impatience; in its claws a crane
<lb/>Was helpless quarry, and a pard had been
<milestone unit="calced" n="1518"/>
<lb/>Its proper prey. At length it soared from sight,
<lb/>And bound a crane, then soared again and flew
<lb/>Like shaft from bow, the falconer pursuing.
<lb/>The Shah was vexed that it had flown away,
<lb/>And followed by the tinkling of its bells.
<lb/>He came upon a spacious pleasure-ground,
<lb/>With mansion rising in a coign thereof,—
<lb/>And thither went with certain of his men,
<lb/>The rest remaining on the hunting-field.
<lb/>On entering Bahram Gur saw a garden
<lb/>As ’twere a mountain-skirt. Upon the ground
<lb/>Brocade was spread, and all the place was full
<lb/>Of slaves and wealth. A pool was in the centre
<lb/>Whereby an old man sat. Three girls like ivory
<pb n="50"/>
<lb/>Sat by him wearing turquoise crowns. Their cheeks
<lb/>Were like the spring, their statures tall, their eyebrows
<lb/>Arched, and their tresses lassos; each girl held
<lb/>A crystal goblet, and Bahram Gar saw them.
<lb/>His eyes were dazzled at the spectacle
<lb/>Just as his heart was gloomed for his tughral.
<lb/>On seeing him that wealthy thane grew pale
<lb/>As fenugreek with fear. A wise old man
<lb/>Was he, Barzin by name, but ill-affected
<lb/>Toward the Shah. As swift as wind he left

<lb/>The hauz,<note>1 See Vol. i. p. 208 note.</note> approached the Shah, and kissed the ground,
<lb/>Then said: <q>“O monarch of the sun-like face!
<lb/>May heaven revolve according to thy will.
<lb/>I do not dare to say to thee: ‘Abide
<lb/>With thy two hundred horsemen on my march.’
<lb/>Still, if the Shah take pleasure in my garden,
<lb/>The glory of Barzin hath reached the moon.”</q>
<lb/>“Today,” the world’s king answered, <q>“the tughral
<lb/>Escaped us. I am vexed about that fowler,
<lb/>Which hunted birds as leopards hunt their quarry.”</q>
<lb/>Barzin replied: <q>“I saw a sable bird
<lb/>Just now with golden bells and pitch-hued body,
<lb/>Its beak and talons turmeric in hue;
<lb/>It came and settled on yon walnut-tree:
<lb/>By thy good fortune it is come to hand.”</q>
<lb/>The Shah said to a servant: <q>“Go and look.”</q>
<lb/>He went like wind and cried: <q>“Glad ever be
<lb/>The world-lord! The tughral is on a bough;
<lb/>E’en now the falconer is taking it.”</q>
<lb/>The hawk thus found, the old man said: <q>“O Shah
<lb/>Without a mate or equal on the earth!
<lb/>Oh! may thine entertainer prove auspicious,
<lb/>And all the wearers of a crown thy slaves.”</q>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1519"/>
<lb/>Call for a wine-cup in our present joy,
<lb/>And, when thou art refreshed, ask what thou wilt.</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king of kings dismounted at the pool,
<lb/>And old Barzin grew glad. With that there came
<lb/>Bahram’s chief minister and therewithal
<lb/>The captains of the host and treasurer.
<lb/>Barzin brought forth a golden cup and first
<lb/>Drank to the monarch of the world, then brought
<lb/>And offered to the Shah a cup of crystal,
<lb/>Who seeing took and drained the proffered draught
<lb/>Below the inscription-line, whereat Barzin
<lb/>In high delight had wine-jars set about
<lb/>The place, and in his cups said to his daughters:—
<lb/><q>“My clever chicks! no chieftain of the host,
<lb/>But Shah Bahram hath visited this garden!
<lb/>So come, thou songstress! let us have a song,
<lb/>And thou, my moon-faced daughter! bring thy harp.”</q>
<lb/>All three drew near the Shah, and on their heads
<lb/>Were jewelled crowns. One danced, another played
<lb/>Upon the harp, the third possessed a sweet
<lb/>And soothing voice. While they made minstrelsy
<lb/>The king of kings in high contentment drained
<lb/>His goblet dry. He said thus to Barzin:—
<lb/><q>What girls are these who live with thee in joy?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Barzin thus answered him: <q>“O Shah! may none
<lb/>Behold the age without thee. Know that these
<lb/>Are mine own daughters and my heart’s delight.
<lb/>One is a caroler, another harpeth,
<lb/>The third observeth measure in the dance.
<lb/>I need not aught, O Shah! for I have money,
<lb/>Domain, and pleasure-ground, and my three daughters
<lb/>Are, as the Shah perceiveth, like glad spring.
<lb/>O moon-face!”</q> said he to the songstress, <q>“fear not,
<lb/>But sing a song about the Shah.”</q>
</p>
<p><lb/>The Idols
<pb n="52"/>
<lb/>Took heart to sing and play. The songstress sang:—
<lb/><q>O moon-faced king! the moon in heaven
<lb/>Alone is like to thee,
<lb/>The royal throne thine only seat.
<lb/>Thou with thy moon-like blee,
<lb/>And teak-like stature art the pride
<lb/>Of throne and crown. Oh! rare
<lb/>For those that see thy face at morn,
<lb/>For those that scent thy hair!
<lb/>Thy loins are tiger-like, thy limbs
<lb/>Are mighty, thy crown’s Grace
<lb/>Is as the cloud-rack high, and like
<lb/>Pomegranate-bloom thy face.
<lb/>For rapture of thy love hearts laugh,
<lb/>Like ocean is thine own;
<lb/>Like cloud thy hand. As thy fit prey
<lb/>I see the lion alone.
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1520"/> Thou splittest with thy shaft a hair,
<lb/>And by thine equity
<lb/>Convertest water into milk.
<lb/>When hostile armies see
<lb/>Thy lasso and thy puissant arm
<lb/>Their hearts and brains are rent
<lb/>However mighty their array,
<lb/>Howe’er on battle bent.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, having heard the ditty, drained
<lb/>The massive crystal cup and thus addressed
<lb/>Barzin: <q>“O noble sir, experienced much
<lb/>Is this world’s heat and cold! thou wilt not find
<lb/>A better son-in-law than me who am
<lb/>"Mid kings a hero and the king of men.
<lb/>Bestow thy daughters on me—all the three—
<pb n="53"/>
<lb/>And I will raise thy coronet to Saturn.”</q>
<lb/><q>“O king!” Barzin replied, “may wine and bearer
<lb/>Find favour in thy sight. Who will dare say
<lb/>That he hath such a Venus in his house?
<lb/>If now thou wilt accept me as a slave
<lb/>To serve before the throne of king of kings
<lb/>Then will I pay my service to thy crown,
<lb/>Thy throne, thy Grace, thy fortune, and thy state;
<lb/>Moreover my three daughters are thy handmaids
<lb/>To stand before thee as thy slaves. The Shah
<lb/>Approved of them as such or ever he
<lb/>Saw these three Moons afar. As teaks are they
<lb/>In stature and as ivory in hue,
<lb/>Fit for the throne and to adorn the crown.
<lb/>Now will I tell the monarch of the world
<lb/>What fortune I possess for good and ill:
<lb/>Of clothes and carpets, stuffs and draperies,
<lb/>Good sooth have I stored up in mine abode
<lb/>Two hundred camel-loads or more as well
<lb/>As necklaces and bracelets, crowns and thrones,
<lb/>All for my daughters’ pleasure.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“Leave what thou hast in store,
<lb/>Where now it is, and seek mirth with the wine-cup.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The elder answered: <q>“My three moon-like daughters
<lb/>I give thee by the rites of Gayomart
<lb/>And of Hushang. Dust are they 'neath thy feet,
<lb/>And all the three live but to do thy will.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The eldest daughter’s name was Mah Afrid,
<lb/>The second’s Faranak, and the cadette’s
<lb/>Was Shambalid. Approving them at sight
<lb/>The Shah preferred them 'mongst his lawful wives,
<lb/>And bade a noble of his escort bring
<lb/>Four golden litters,<note>The fourth was for himself and needful. See below.</note> and, when all three Idols
<lb/>Were set therein, they were encircled there
<pb n="54"/>
<lb/>By forty Ruman slaves—their devotees—
<lb/>Who called down praises on them as they went,
<lb/>While they departed to their golden home
<lb/>The glorious Shah caroused. A servant hung
<lb/>His whip above the court-gate, for the escort,
<lb/>Save by the token of the whip, ne’er knew
<lb/>Where Shah and nobles were. When any one
<lb/>Beheld the handle and its lengthy thong
<lb/>He used to run thereto and do obeisance.
<lb/>Bahram drank on until he was bemused,
<lb/>Then gloriously took his seat within a litter,
<lb/>And went back to his women’s golden house—
<lb/>The house that was perfumed with ambergris.
<lb/>On his return he tarried for a week,
<lb/>And much he feasted, lavished, and held converse.
<lb/>The eighth day he went hunting with Ruzbih,
<lb/>And with a thousand cavaliers. He saw
<lb/>That all the plain was full of onager,
<lb/>Drew from its case his royal bow, and strung it,
<lb/>Invoking God who giveth victory.
<lb/>'Twas springtide and the onager were pairing.
<lb/>From all the world they met confronting there,
<lb/>And rent each other’s hides, the face of earth
<lb/>Was reddened with their blood. Bahram abode
<lb/>While two bucks fought together furiously,
<lb/>Then when the valiant buck that gained the day
<lb/>Was covering a doe he laughed to see
<lb/>The onagers, took hold upon his bow-string,
<lb/>Shot, piercing the buck’s flank so that the arrow
<lb/>Went home up to its plumes, and skewered buck
<lb/>And doe together, thrilling all his escort.
<lb/>All who beheld that shot acclaimed the Shah:—
<lb/><q>“Oh! be the evil eye far from thy Grace,
<lb/>And may thy whole life be a festival.
<lb/>Such might as thine the age ne’er saw till now;
<lb/>At once Shah, warrior, and king art thou.”</q>

<head>§ 14 How Bahram slew Lions, went to the House of a Jeweller, and married his Daughter</head>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah, on urging thence his steed Shabrang,
<lb/>Came on a forest and beheld before it
<lb/>Two savage lions, strung and drew his bow.
<lb/>The arrow, striking on the lion’s breast,
<lb/>Was buried to the plumes. Forthwith Bahram
<lb/>Turned to the lioness and, shooting, pinned
<lb/>Her breast and loins together, but exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>“The shaft was featherless, the point was blunt,
<lb/>If point there were.”</q>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1522"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The escort praised him, saying:—
<lb/><q>O famous king of earth! none ever saw,
<lb/>Or will see, on the throne of king of kings
<lb/>A Shah like thee, who with unfeathered arrows
<lb/>O’erthrowest lions, and with plumed uprootest
<lb/>A mount of flint.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The monarch with his meiny
<lb/>Rode on along the meadow-land and saw
<lb/>A forest full of sheep, their herds in flight
<lb/>For fear of harm. The chief herd, ne’er at ease
<lb/>For terror of wild beasts, perceived Bahram,
<lb/>Who said to him: <q>“What man is driving sheep
<lb/>To this unlikely spot?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The head man answered:—
<lb/><q>“Great sir! none cometh to this pasturage
<lb/>Except myself. They are a jeweller’s:
<lb/>I drove them from the mountains yesterday.
<lb/>The owner is a wealthy man not troubled
<lb/>By fear of loss. He owneth gems by ass-loads,
<lb/>Gold, silver, trinketry. He hath withal
<lb/>One only daughter, skilful on the harp.
<lb/>Her tresses cluster on her head in curls.
<pb n="56"/>

<lb/>He will take wine from her hand only. None
<lb/>Hath seen an old man like him. How could he
<lb/>Have kept his property but by the justice
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram? The great king of the world
<lb/>Is not concerned for gold, and his archmages
<lb/>Are not unjust; but say who slew these beasts,
<lb/>For may the Ruler of the world uphold him?”</q>

</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“This pair of lions fell
<lb/>Beneath the arrows of a valiant man,
<lb/>Who, having slain these gallant beasts, departed
<lb/>With seven other gallant cavaliers.
<lb/>Where is the jeweller’s mansion? Point the way,
<lb/>And hide it not from us.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The chief hind said:—
<lb/><q>“Proceed and thou wilt reach a brand-new seat.
<lb/>The jeweller thence fareth to the city,
<lb/>To Shah Bahram’s own palace, but, what time
<lb/>The sun doth don its Sable Silk, returneth
<lb/>To banquet. Revelling and sound of lyre
<lb/>Will reach thine ears if thou wilt bide a while.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram, on hearing this, called for his steed,
<lb/>And for apparel suited to a king,
<lb/>Then parted from his minister and escort.
<lb/>Good sooth! but he was full of eagerness!
<lb/>Ruzbih said to the chiefs: <q>“So now the Shah
<lb/>Is going to the village, there to knock
<lb/>Upon the portal of the jeweller!

<lb/>And, mark my words! will ask of him his daughter,
<lb/>And crown her doubtless with a crown of gold,
<lb/>Will take her to his ladies’ golden house,
<lb/>And send that other three back to Barzin!
<lb/>He never hath enough of chambering;
<lb/>His consort flitteth ere the night is over!
<lb/>He hath above a hundred ladies’ bowers!
<lb/>'Tis ill to have a king of kings like this.”</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Just now a eunuch reckoned up nine hundred
<lb/>And thirty damsels wearing jewelled crowns
<lb/>Within the palace, all provided for!
<lb/>The Shah demandeth tribute from all lands,
<lb/>And Rum will be exhausted in a year.
<lb/>Alack! for shoulders, breast, and height like his,
<lb/>And face that brightened all the company!
<lb/>None will behold his like in strength and stature,
<lb/>Who pinneth with one shaft two onagers;
<lb/>But dalliance with women marreth him,
<lb/>He soon will be as feeble as a ghost!
<lb/>His eyes will darken and his looks grow wan,
<lb/>His body slacken and his cheeks turn blue.
<lb/>To sniff at women maketh hoary heads,
<lb/>And hoary heads have naught to hope on earth.
<lb/>As polo-playing maketh stoop the upright,
<lb/>So womanizing causeth every ill.
<lb/>Once in a month is intercourse enough,
<lb/>While more is waste of blood. A wise youth too
<lb/>Should husband vigour for his children’s sake.
<lb/>In this excess there is excess of loss,
<lb/>And slackness is afflictive to a man.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They went back to the palace, talking still,
<lb/>And one remarked: <q>The Sun hath lost his way.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur, with one slave to mind his horse,
<lb/>Fared through the gloom of night and, when he neared
<lb/>The jeweller’s abode, heard sounds of harping,
<lb/>Whereto he urged Gulgun, his steed, forthwith
<lb/>Toward the merchant’s house. He knocked and asked
<lb/>Admittance, all the while invoking Him
<lb/>Who made the sun. A kindly handmaid said:—
<lb/><q>Who's there? Why knock thus at this time of night?</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>This morning as the Shah
<lb/>Was coming from the hunting-ground my horse
<lb/>Went lame, and I perforce got left behind.

<pb n="58"/>
<lb/>Here in this thoroughfare the folk will steal
<lb/>A steed like this and my gold harness too,
<lb/>So I need help.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The handmaid went and told
<lb/>Her lord: <q>“A man requesteth shelter, saying:
<lb/>'My steed with its gold harness will be stolen,
<lb/>And I shall go away undone.'”</q>
<lb/>He answered:—
<lb/><q>“Then ope the door. Hast never seen a guest
<lb/>Come here before?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1524"/>
<lb/>The maid made haste to open,
<lb/>And said: <q>“Come in, my son!”</q>
<lb/>The Shah on entering,
<lb/>And seeing such a place and such attendance,
<lb/>Said to himself: <q>“O just and only God!
<lb/>Thou art Thy servant’s Guide to what is good.
<lb/>Ne’er may I be but just in conduct, never
<lb/>Be covetous and arrogance my creed,
<lb/>Let every act and deed of mine be just,
<lb/>And let my subjects’ hearts rejoice in me:
<lb/>Then, if my knowledge and my justice wax,
<lb/>My memory will shine when I am dead.
<lb/>May all my subjects, like this jeweller,
<lb/>Enjoy the sound of harp and revelry.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>On entering the lofty hall he saw
<lb/>The jeweller’s famed daughter from the door.
<lb/>The thane, on seeing him, arose and came
<lb/>With bows profound, and said: <q>“Good ev’n to thee.
<lb/>May all thy foemen’s hearts be rooted out.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The host spread out a mat and laid thereon
<lb/>A cushion, gazing at his guest with joy.
<lb/>One brought a sumptuous board with viands hot
<lb/>And cold thereon. One came—a faithful liege—
<lb/>And was instructed to secure the steed.
<lb/>Elsewhere they lodged and fed Bahram Gar’s servant.
<lb/>They set a low seat for the host himself,
<pb n="59"/>
<lb/>Who took his place close to his guest the Shah,
<lb/>And then began to offer his excuse,
<lb/>Thus saying to Bahram: <q>“Brave paladin!
<lb/>Since thou art entertained within my house
<lb/>Conform thyself to my rough usages.
<lb/>When we have eaten we must drink and then
<lb/>Rest sweetly. ‘Tis dark night, the wine is royal;
<lb/>When thou hast drunk thy quantum thou shalt sleep,
<lb/>And, when thou wakest at the break of day,
<lb/>Must haste back to the service of the Shah.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“Night dark when one alighteth
<lb/>On cheery host like thee! We must not prove
<lb/>Ingrate to God; the hearts of thankless men
<lb/>Are full of fear.”</q>
<lb/>The handmaid, who was all
<lb/>Astonied at the aspect of the guest,
<lb/>Brought water, bowl, and napkin. Hands were washed,
<lb/>Then came the wine-cup’s turn, and with the wine
<lb/>Came mirth, contentment, and tranquillity.
<lb/>The handmaid brought a flagon and strong drink,
<lb/>Red wine, a cup, and flowers of fenugreek.
<lb/>The thane first reached out for the cup and drank,
<lb/>Then washed it out with musk and with rose-water,
<lb/>And gave the cup that cheereth to Bahram.
<lb/>“What,” said he, “is my boon-companion’s name?
<lb/>Now will I make a covenant with thee,
<lb/>And I will take Bahram, the Shah, as surety.”
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The king laughed heartily thereat and said:—
<lb/><q>“Gushasp, the cavalier, am I, and hither
<lb/>Came I attracted by the sound of harp,
<lb/>And not to drink or while away the time.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“This girl of mine,” his host replied, <q>“exalteth
<lb/>My head to heaven and is at once my harper,
<lb/>And my cup-bearer, and withal she singeth,
<lb/>And dissipateth care. My Heart’s Delight
<lb/>Is named Arzi—my heart’s delight and server.”</q>

<pb n="60"/>

<lb/>He said to that tall Cypress: <q>“Bring thy harp,
<lb/>Come in thy loveliness before Gushasp.”</q>
<lb/>The harpist, tall as a pomegranate-tree,
<lb/>Moved stately to the king of kings and said:—
<lb/><q>“O chosen cavalier who hast in all
<lb/>The semblance of a king! know that this house
<lb/>Of feasting is thine own, my sire thy host
<lb/>And treasurer. May thy dark nights be joyous,
<lb/>And be thy head exalted o’er the rain-clouds.”</q>
<lb/>He said to her: <q>“Sit down, take up thy harp,
<lb/>And let us have a song immediately.
<lb/>To-night old Mahiyar shall be a youth,
<lb/>And pledge his soul as hostage for his guest.”</q>
<lb/>The harpist clasped her harp and first she played
<lb/>The Magians’ chant, and as the silken chords
<lb/>Rang out an odour as of jasmine filled
<lb/>The room. She sang to Mahiyar, her sire,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>“How plaintive is her harp!”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>“Thou art as a cypress
<lb/>That lippeth a stream,
<lb/>And white locks encircle
<lb/>Thy cheeks’ rosy gleam.
<lb/>Thy tongue is warm-spoken,
<lb/>Thy heart loveth peace,
<lb/>Oh! ne’er may thy foemen
<lb/>Of ill have surcease.
<lb/>Thy soul’s food be wisdom.
<lb/>Thy bent is as great
<lb/>As Faridun’s. On thee
<lb/>As handmaid I wait.
<lb/>Arzi am I titled,
<lb/>I joy in our guest,
<lb/>Like monarch whose troops are
<lb/>With victory blest.”
</p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p>
<lb/>This ditty done, toward the guest she turned,
<lb/>Turned toward him with a song and plaintive chords:—
<lb/><q>Sincere and brave, high-starred and king-like one!
<lb/>They that ne’er saw Bahram, the cavalier,
<lb/>The well approved, to every bosom dear,
<lb/>Should look upon thy face, and all is done.
<lb/>His only semblance in the host thou art,
<lb/>Tall as a cypress with a reed-like waist,
<lb/>A cypress with a pheasant’s carriage graced,
<lb/>An elephant in bulk with lion’s heart.
<lb/>Two miles in fight thou flingest forth thy spear,
<lb/>Thy cheeks as though pomegranate-blossoms shine
<lb/>(Who was it washed, say’st thou, those blooms in wine?)
<lb/>And as a camel’s thighs thine arms appear.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1526"/>

<lb/>Thou tramplest Mount Bistan. Heaven toiled to mould
<lb/>A man like thee. None see I to compete
<lb/>In strife with thee. As dust beneath thy feet
<lb/>Oh! may Arzi’s form be while life shall hold.”</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The girl’s proficiency with song and harp,
<lb/>Her looks, her stature, and accomplishments,
<lb/>So wrought the world-lord that thou wouldst have said:—
<lb/><q>“His heart hath grown a magazine of woes,”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>And at the time when Mahiyar grew drunk
<lb/>Before him he addressed his host, thus saying:—
<lb/><q>“Give me thy daughter as my lawful wife
<lb/>If thou wouldst be commended for just dealing.”</q>
<lb/><q>“Wilt thou accept,”</q> said Mahiyar to her,
<lb/><q>“The presents of this lion-hearted man?
<lb/>See if he pleaseth thee, and if ’tis well
<lb/>For thee to go with him.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Arzi replied:—

<pb n="62"/>
<lb/><q>Good, noble father!<note>Reading with P.</note> if thou wouldst bestow me
<lb/>On any then my partner is Gushasp,
<lb/>The cavalier. One that doth look upon
<lb/>A man like this will bid Bahram ‘Avaunt!’</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>His daughter’s words misliked him and he said
<lb/>Thus to Bahram: <q>“O horseman of the fray!
<lb/>Regard her carefully from head to foot,
<lb/>Her industry, her knowledge, and discretion;
<lb/>See if she be approved of thee at heart;
<lb/>Report of her is better than assumption.
<lb/>She is at once accomplished and no beggar;
<lb/>I do not specify exact amounts,
<lb/>But shouldst thou count the gems of Mahiyar
<lb/>They would exceed those in the royal coffers.
<lb/>Be not precipitate, take rest to-night,
<lb/>And, if needs must, another cup of wine,
<lb/>For great men make no compacts in their cups
<lb/>Especially about their lady-loves.
<lb/>Wait therefore till the sun shall rise on high,
<lb/>And till the nobles’ heads have roused from sleep,
<lb/>Then will we call far-seeing elders—
<lb/>Disinterested men and scholarly.
<lb/>At night ’tis out of order and ignoreth
<lb/>The precedents of Faridun, the Shah.
<lb/>Ill-omened ’tis to marry in one’s cups
<lb/>Or handsel any business.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram:—
<lb/><q>“Absurd! ’Tis ill to draw, or go by, omens.
<lb/>This harpist pleaseth me to-night, so strive
<lb/>To deem the matter an auspicious one.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The sire said to his daughter: <q>“O Arza!
<lb/>Dost thou approve him as to looks and manners?”</q>
<lb/>She said: <q>“Yea, I approved of him when I
<lb/>Far off beheld him with such head and eyes.

<pb n="63"/>
<lb/>Complete the work and leave the rest to God:
<lb/>The sky is not at feud with Mahiyar.”</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>Her father answered: <q>“Thou art now his wife.
<lb/>Know this that thou art under coverture.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1527"/>
<lb/>He gave her to Bahram Gur who espoused her;
<lb/>By dawn the matter had been consummate.
<lb/>The Shah’s attendant hung the royal whip
<lb/>Upon the door of Mahiyar, Arzi
<lb/>Went to her chamber while on every side
<lb/>Folk still were sleeping. Mahiyar departed
<lb/>To make all ready for the cavalier,
<lb/>Gushasp, and told a servant: <q>“Shut the doors,
<lb/>And send off someone to the flock in haste.
<lb/>They must not serve the board without a lamb,
<lb/>And one well fattened too. Wait on Gushasp,
<lb/>And, when he waketh, bring him ice and sherbet,<note>Fakké’. See Vol. i. p. 43 note.</note>
<lb/>Take too a bowl of camphor and rose-water
<lb/>To scent his chamber. As for me, my cups
<lb/>Have left me just as I was yesterday;
<lb/>Old jewellers shirk not their wine.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He spake,
<lb/>And, drawing up his cloak about his head,
<lb/>Wooed rest and sleep.
<lb/>When bright Sol showed its crown,
<lb/>And earth became like shining ivory,
<lb/>Troops armed with shields and double-headed darts
<lb/>Went to seek traces of the royal whip.
<lb/>The escort gathered round the door as though
<lb/>The Shah’s own court, and all that recognised
<lb/>The whip came forward and saluted it.
<lb/>The porter, seeing that great gathering,
<lb/>The throng of swordsmen and of javelin-men,
<lb/>Went, roused his sleeping lord, and sobered him,
<lb/>Thus saying to him: <q>“Rise, bestir thyself;
<lb/>This is no time to sleep or place to sit,
<lb/>Because the world’s king is thy guest within
<lb/>This sorry house of thine!”</q>
<pb n="64"/>
<lb/><milestone unit="calced" n="1528"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The jeweller’s heart
<lb/>Throbbed wildly at the words. He cried: <q>“What say'st thou?
<lb/>How tracest thou the footsteps of the king?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then fully realising what was said
<lb/>He sprang up from the bed-clothes with a shout,
<lb/>Enraged against the porter, <q>“These,”</q> he cried,
<lb/><q>“Are not the words of wisdom and of age.”</q>
<lb/><q>“Experienced man!”</q> the slave said, <q>“who on earth
<lb/>Made thee the monarch of Iran? So vast
<lb/>A host is at thy gate that, wouldst thou pass,
<lb/>There is scant room, and every Jack of them,
<lb/>On coming up, saluteth our old curtain!<note>The felt curtain at the door-way. Cf. p. 69.</note>
<lb/>At dawn, before the sun began to shine,
<lb/>The cavalier’s attendant came and hung
<lb/>A whip all gold and jewels o’er our entry,
<lb/>Where we pass through it, and round that long whip
<milestone unit="calced" n="1528"/>
<lb/>There is a world of folk from hill and dale.
<lb/>So now be up and doing, be not slack,
<lb/>And let not wine affect thee.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Hearing this,
<lb/>The shrewd old man was troubled: <q>“Why did I
<lb/>Get drunk last night before the king of kings,
<lb/>And let my daughter share the wine with us?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then going to the chamber of Arzi
<lb/>He said: <q>“My gracious Moon! it was Bahram,
<lb/>The king of kings, that last night visited
<lb/>The jeweller! On coming from the chase
<lb/>He hither turned his steed. Now up and don
<lb/>Brocade of Rum and set upon thy head
<lb/>Thy last night’s crown. Make him an offering
<lb/>Of jewels worthy of a king—three rubies
<lb/>Of royal worth—and, when thou shalt behold
<pb n="65"/>
<lb/>His sun-like face, enfold thine arms before him,
<lb/>Keep thine eyes fixed on him and think of him
<lb/>As thine own soul and body. Answer meekly
<lb/>When he shall question thee, and let thy words
<lb/>Be modest and discreet. I shall not come
<lb/>Unless he calleth me and giveth me
<lb/>A place among his followers. I sat
<lb/>At table with him like his peer! Oh! would
<lb/>That I had no bones in me! Furthermore
<lb/>I cottoned with the Shah when in my cups!
<lb/>Wine maketh old and young to misdemean.”</q>
<lb/>Just then a slave came hurrying and said:
<lb/><q>“The Shah, that ardent spirit, is awake.”</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the Shah woke safe and sound, he went
<lb/>To bathe him in the garden, went to pray
<lb/>Before the sun, confiding all to God.
<lb/>Returning thence to the reception-room
<lb/>He bade a server bring a cup of wine,
<lb/>Heard that his retinue had come, dismissed it,
<lb/>And called Arzi on whom his heart was set.<note>Arzu means ‘Desire,’ and there is a double use of the word in the
<lb/>original: "Because he had a desire for Desire.”</note>
<lb/>Arzi appeared with wine and offerings—
<lb/>A handmaid with her necklace and her earrings—
<lb/>And with a lowly reverence kissed the ground.
<lb/>The Shah smiled on her greatly pleased and said:—
<lb/><q>“Whence such behaviour—first to make me drunk,
<lb/>Then run away? Thy song and harp suffice
<lb/>For me, a woman’s presents are for others.
<lb/>Come sing to me thy ditties of the chase,
<lb/>Of spearhead-blows, and royal combatings.”</q>
<lb/>Anon he said: <q>“Where is the jeweller,
<lb/>For we got drunk together yesternight?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The daughter, when she heard this, called her father,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1529"/>
<lb/>Mazed at the Shah’s good-nature. Came her sire
<lb/>With folded arms before the sun-like king





<pb n="66"/>
<lb/>Of kings, and said: <q>“O Shah! O chief! O wise!
<lb/>O great! O mighty one! O warrior!
<lb/>O archimage! may this world ever be
<lb/>At thy dispose and everywhere thy name
<lb/>Associate with the crown. The man that quaffeth
<lb/>The draught of foolishness should hold his tongue.
<lb/>My fault was due to ignorance. Methinks
<lb/>That thou must deem me mad. Vouchsafe to pardon
<lb/>My fault and make my face and faring bright.
<lb/>I stand—a foolish slave—before thy door;
<lb/>The king of kings will deem me less than man.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram replied: <q>“The wise man never taketh
<lb/>The drunkard seriously; one should not eye
<lb/>Or savour wine if it make sad the face.
<lb/>I saw thee not ill-tempered in thy cups.
<lb/>Now listen to the singing of Arzu,
<lb/>And proffer as thine own apology
<lb/>The tulips and the jasmine of her song.
<lb/>Let her descant what while we quaff, not counting
<lb/>The ill of days not come.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He kissed the ground,
<lb/>Did Mahiyar, then brought and spread the board,
<lb/>And, good man that he was, he fetched withal
<lb/>The nobles that were stationed at the gate;
<lb/>Howbeit Arzi went off to her own bower,
<lb/>Her visage puckered at those stranger-guests,
<lb/>And stayed till heaven grew sombre, and the stars
<lb/>Came out around the moon. The eating done,
<lb/>Arzi was called and set upon a seat
<lb/>Of golden work. The Shah bade her to take
<lb/>Her harp and sing to him the song that he
<lb/>Had asked of her already. Thus she sang:—
<lb/><q>“O monarch undaunted! the lion in shame
<lb/>Will slink from the wood at the bruit of thy name.
<lb/>Shah, victor, host-breaker art thou. In thy mien
<pb n="67"/>
<lb/>The tints of the tulip on jasmine are seen.
<lb/>In stature no ruler on earth is thy peer,
<lb/>In looks thou transcendest the moon in her sphere.
<lb/>A host on the war-stead, beholding in fight
<lb/>Thy helmet, will rive, heart and brain, with affright,
<lb/>And longer discern not the depth from the height.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>When they were blithe with wine and, eating done,
<lb/>Were quaffing draught on draught, Ruzbih appeared
<lb/>Before the Shah. They lodged him in the village.
<lb/>Ruzbih had brought a litter and withal
<lb/>Two score of eunuchs, all moon-faced and charming.
<lb/>Those Roman’s faces seemed brocade of Rum,
<lb/>And freshened all the country round. Arzi,
<lb/>A crown of jewels set upon her head,
<lb/>Toward the bower of Shah Bahram Gur sped.
</p>



<head>§ 15</head>
<lb/>How Bahram went to the Chase and passed the Night at the House of Farshidward
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1530"/>
<lb/>The king of kings, attended by Ruzbih,
<lb/>Went from the chief’s house with a gladsome heart.
<lb/>He passed the night and went at dawn to hunt.
<lb/>Troops fared o’er all the roads and trackless wastes,
<lb/>And thus abode a month. They pitched the tents
<lb/>And camp-enclosure, and swept all the field
<lb/>Of game. None slumbered there, it was all wine,
<lb/>Game, flesh, and harp, and lyre. They kindled fires
<lb/>About the plain and burned wood green and dry.
<lb/>There came a swarm of dealers from the city,
<lb/>Who tarried at the camp for trafficking:
<lb/>The crowd made bright the waste. At quarter price
<lb/>They bought one onager or ten gazelles,
<lb/>And whosoever was in want of meat,
<lb/>For cooking for his guests or for his children,
<pb n="68"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1531"/>
<lb/>Might carry home ground-game and water-fowl
<lb/>By ass-loads.
<lb/>When a month had passed Bahram
<lb/>Grew eager for his wives’ society,
<lb/>And led his people from the hunting-ground.
<lb/>Folk could not see the way, the cavaliers
<lb/>Raised such a dust! but swift as dust they sped
<lb/>Till day’s cheeks turned to Lapis-lazuli.
<lb/>The Shah observed a town in front of him
<lb/>With groups of houses, roadways, and bazaars,
<lb/>And ordered that his escort with the baggage
<lb/>Should push on, leaving not a soul behind.
<lb/>He asked: <q>“Where is the chief man of the place?”</q>
<lb/>And then made thither straightway. He beheld
<lb/>A shattered entry broad and deep. The owner
<lb/>Came and saluted him. The Shah inquired:—
<lb/><q>“Whose ruin is this and wherefore in such plight
<lb/>Amidst the town?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The master said: <q>“'Tis mine,
<lb/>And ill luck is my guide. I have not here
<lb/>Kine, raiment, victuals, manhood, understanding,
<lb/>No feet, no wings. Me thou hast seen, now view
<lb/>My house—one fitter for a curse than blessing.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The aspiring Shah alighted, scanned the house,
<lb/>And hands and feet both failed him, for the place
<lb/>Was all sheep's droppings though both great and vaulted!
<lb/><q>“Bring me,”</q> he said, <q>“thou hospitable man!
<lb/>Somewhat whereon to sit.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The other answered:—
<lb/><q>“Why mock thy host so wantonly, O marchlord!
<lb/>Had I some draperies my guest would praise me,
<lb/>But I have none, no clothing, food, or carpets.
<lb/>Pray lodge thee somewhere else; here all is poor.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>“Fetch a cushion then that I
<lb/>May sit awhile.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“The place is ill,” he answered.
<pb n="69"/>
<lb/><q>“Good sooth! wouldst thou have bird’s milk?”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Said Bahram:—
<lb/><q>“Bring fresh milk and new bread if thou canst get it.”</q>
<lb/><q>“Imagine,”</q> said the other, <q>“that thou hast
<lb/>Partaken and gone off with ‘Fare thee well.’
<lb/>I should not be so lifeless had I bread,
<lb/>Though life were better far than bread to me.”</q>
<lb/>Bahram said: <q>“If thou hast no sheep how come
<lb/>These droppings here?”</q>
<lb/>“'Tis night,” the other answered.
<lb/><q>“My head is all a muddle with thy talk.
<lb/>Select some mansion with a curtained entrance;
<lb/>The master of it will commend thy choice.
<lb/>Why shouldst thou be with an unfortunate,
<lb/>Who maketh leaves his pillow for the night?
<lb/>Thou hast a golden sword and stirrups, thou
<lb/>Shouldst sojourn not where there is fear of thieves,
<lb/>For thieves and lions haunt old hulks like this.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>“If a thief should rob me now
<lb/>Thou wouldst not be responsible, but give me
<lb/>A lodging for the night, 'tis all I need.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>“Then need it not,” the owner made reply;
<lb/><q>“None lodgeth in my house.”</q>
<lb/>“O wise old man!
<lb/>Why art thou,” said the Shah, <q>“so short with me?
<lb/>Still thou wilt give me, I presume, cold water,
<lb/>O noble one!”</q>
<lb/>“Didst thou not see,” rejoined
<lb/>The householder, <q>“more than two bow-shots long<note>Or "hence. So Mohl.</note>
<lb/>The pool? There drink and take whate’er thou wilt.
<lb/>Why seek for aught in this impoverished house?
<lb/>Good sooth! hast never seen a poor man barred
<lb/>From working by decrepitude?”</q>
</p>
<lb/>Bahram
<lb/>Rejoined: <q>“Thou art not one of the first water,
<note n="1">Or “hence.” So Mohl.</note>
<pb n="70"/>
<lb/>Chief though thou be; so strive not with a soldier.
<lb/>What is thy name?”</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>“Farshidward,
<lb/>A man without land, raiment, sleep, and food.”</q>
<lb/>Bahram asked: <q>“Why endeavour not for provand
<lb/>And comfort?”</q>
<lb/>Said the master of the house:—
<lb/><q>“He that bestoweth all may end my days.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1532"/>

<lb/>If only I can see my desolation
<lb/>Relieved of thee I will make prayer to Him.
<lb/>Why cam’st thou to an empty house that never
<lb/>Saw good condition and a high estate?”</q>
<lb/>When he had spoken thus he wept so sorely
<lb/>That Shah Bahram fled from his cries. He laughed
<lb/>At that old man and took the road again,
<lb/>While all his escort followed in his train.

<head>§ 16</head>
<lb/>How a Bramble-grubber revealed the Case of Farshidward, and
<lb/>how Bahram bestowed that Householder’s Wealth upon the
<lb/>Poor
<p>
<lb/>Bahram, on quitting that famed township, came
<lb/>Upon a bramble-brake. A man, who held
<lb/>A mattock in his hand, was grubbing there.
<lb/>The monarch left his retinue, drew near him,
<lb/>And said; <q>“O enemy of brambles! whom
<lb/>Know’st thou of most account in yonder town?”</q>
<lb/>He answered: <q>“Farshidward—a man of greed
<lb/>That doth not suffer him to sleep or eat.
<lb/>He hath, may be, a hundred thousand sheep,
<lb/>More camels, steeds, and asses. Earth is full
<lb/>Of his amassed dinars, but would that he
<lb/>Had neither skin nor marrow to his body!
<pb n="71"/>
<lb/>- A famished paunch and nakedness are his;
<lb/>He hath no child, no kin, no friends, no goods.
<lb/>A captive in the hands of Greed and Need
<lb/>His person is all misery and wasted
<lb/>Through eating not, but if he were to sell
<lb/>For gold his tilth ’twould purchase gems enough
<lb/>To fill a house! His shepherds swill down flesh
<lb/>With milk, but he himself hath millet-bread
<lb/>Without e’en cheese! He never saw two coats
<lb/>At once; he is a tyrant to himself.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said to the grubber: <q>“Thou dost know
<lb/>The number of his sheep, but knowest thou
<lb/>Where those flocks are and likewise where his steeds
<lb/>And camels are at large?”</q>
<lb/>The grubber said:—
<lb/><q>“O thou! it is not far from here to where
<lb/>His camels and his sheep are, but my heart
<lb/>Is troubled at the ill that he may do me.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur gave the grubber some dinars,
<lb/>And said: <q>“This day shall gentle thy condition.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He bade one of his escort come to him,
<lb/>A man that knew his way about, by name
<lb/>Bihruz, a horseman brave and popular,
<lb/>And sent with him a hundred cavaliers,
<lb/>Selected men well suited to the work.
<lb/>He chose withal a scribe, an honest man
<milestone unit="calced" n="1533"/>
<lb/>And skilled accountant. <q>“Go,”</q> he told the grubber,
<lb/><q>“Thou didst grub brambles, now reap gold. One hundredth
<lb/>Of all that wealth is thine. Show to these men
<lb/>The way.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The grubber’s name was Dilafruz,
<lb/>A man of stately mien and stalwart form.
<lb/>Bahram bestowed on him a noble steed,
<lb/>And said: <q>“Thou must companion with the wind.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He was the Light of hearts but he became
<pb n="72"/>
<lb/>The Lustre of the world<note>He was, i.e. his name was, Dilafruz, but he became Gitiafruz.</note> and carried out
<lb/>His task triumphantly. He led the troop
<lb/>O’er hill and plain past countless flocks of sheep.
<lb/>Upon the mountains were ten caravans
<lb/>Of camels, each with its own caravaneer.
<lb/>The scribe wrote down of draught and of milch cattle
<lb/>Twelve thousand, and the number of the camels
<lb/>And steeds as twice ten thousand. All the waste
<lb/>Was dinted with their hoofs. Beside the stream
<lb/>There were three hundred thousand camel-loads
<lb/>Of potted butter and curds fresh and dried.<note>For winter use.</note>
<lb/>Height, waste, and level were one mighty cache,
<lb/>But none had heard thereof. Bihruz, the son
<lb/>Of Har, reported to the king of kings,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, praising first almighty God,
<lb/>The All-victorious and All-nourisher,
<lb/>And next the king of kings who had released
<lb/>Men’s hands from toil, and then proceeded thus:—
<lb/><q>“O monarch of the world! thou art the joy
<lb/>Of all folk great and small because thy justice
<lb/>Surpasseth bounds. Our treasury hath suffered
<lb/>Through silence as to this man’s wealth. ‘Tis well
<lb/>That all things in the world should have their bounds,
<lb/>Well that the Shah be boundlessly rejoiced.
<lb/>A wretch there is named Farshidward, unknown
<lb/>In feast and fight to great and small alike
<lb/>Throughout the world, not fearing God or Shah,
<lb/>And thankless in respect of what he hath.
<lb/>While thus he streweth o’er the world his wealth
<lb/>He is a lack-all, wretched, secretive,
<lb/>Who is as unjust as the Shah is just.
<lb/>Blame not my words and counsel. Let this wealth
<lb/>Inaugurate a treasury; ‘twill need




<pb n="73"/>
<lb/>Three years to order it. I have invoked
<lb/>To mine assistance certain other scribes,
<lb/>And settled them upon this fertile mount,
<lb/>But, though the writers’ backs are bent, not yet
<lb/>Is manifest the sum of this man’s treasure;
<lb/>Moreover he possesseth, so folk say,
<lb/>Still greater buried hoards of gold and jewels.
<lb/>Here in the mountain am I with both eyes
<lb/>Upon the road to know the Shah’s commands.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1534"/>
<lb/>My salutation to him. May he live
<lb/>What while his name is all in all to all.</q><note>Lit. "is (both) warp and woof."</note>
<lb/>He sent a cameleer post haste to bear
<lb/>The letter to the Shah. Whenas Bahram Gur
<lb/>Had read it he was troubled in his heart,
<lb/>Grew downcast, wept, and bent his warrior-brows.
<lb/>He called for Raman pens and silk of Chin,
<lb/>And bade a scribe approach. He first gave thanks
<lb/>To God almighty, the omniscient Guide,
<lb/>“The Lord of knowledge and of Grace, the Lord
<lb/>Of diadem and kingship,” then wrote thus:—
<lb/><q>“'T should by rights attach this man. He hath not
<lb/>Amassed these hoards by thievery and bloodshed,
<lb/>Hath not incited others to do wrong,
<lb/>But he hath been ungrateful and not had
<lb/>The fear of God within him, hath kept ward
<lb/>O’er all this treasure to the detriment,
<lb/>By such amassing, both of heart and soul.
<lb/>Wolf is as good as sheep upon yon plain
<lb/>Since neither yieldeth profit or return.
<lb/>A buried gem is nothing but a stone,
<lb/>Affording no one either food or raiment.
<lb/>We shall not found a treasury on his toils,
<lb/>Or fix our heart upon this Wayside Inn.
<lb/>Evanished from the world are Faridin,
<lb/>Iraj withal, Tar, and, amidst the mighty,
<pb n="74"/>
<lb/>Sam, Shah Kaus, and Kai Kubad, besides
<lb/>The other potentates whose names we cherish,
<lb/>And mine own sire who filled my heart with pain
<lb/>As being neither just nor generous.
<lb/>None of these great men is in evidence;
<lb/>Herein there is no striving with the Lord.
<lb/>Collect this treasure and distribute it,
<lb/>But touch not thou one hair. To every one
<lb/>That hideth his necessities and looketh
<lb/>Long vainly for remission from his ills;
<lb/>To old men past their work and despicable
<lb/>In rich men’s eyes; to those that have spent all,
<lb/>And now in trouble breathe forth chilling sighs;
<lb/>To those that have renown but not dinars;
<lb/>To traders reft of friends; to little ones
<lb/>Whom thou beholdest orphans, their sires dead,
<lb/>And they themselves in want of gold and silver;
<lb/>To women that have neither spouse nor raiment,
<lb/>That know no handicraft and no employment,
<lb/>Give all these treasures and irradiate
<lb/>The lives of those poor souls. This done, neglect not
<lb/>The hidden treasures, but bestow the hoards
<lb/>Of Farshidward upon the mendicants
<milestone unit="calced" n="1535"/>
<lb/>For their relief. Dinars and gems are dust
<lb/>To him since he must needs go bury them.
<lb/>May turning heaven be thy companion,
<lb/>All justice mayst thou be and self-restraint.”</q>
<lb/>They set the Shah’s seal on the document,
<lb/>And thereupon the courier turned and went.
</p>

<head>§ 17 How Bahram went to the Chase and slew Lions</head>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram bade slaves set up the imperial throne
<lb/>Within the pleasance, then in spring-tide beauty.
<pb n="75"/>
<lb/>They brought the turquoise throne at his command,
<lb/>And set it ‘neath a blossom-shedding tree,
<lb/>They brought forth wine and cups, and minstrels went
<lb/>Toward the pleasance with the chiefs. The king
<lb/>Said to his counsellors: <q>“This is the time
<lb/>Of jollity for men. We all must couch;
<lb/>Death treadeth under foot the rolls of fame,
<lb/>The hall and palace. We shall have enough
<lb/>Of our own company within the charnel,
<lb/>Men both of mien and stature though we be.
<lb/>The king and beggar carry when they die
<lb/>Naught but their good and ill away with them.
<lb/>What toil soe’er men bear is only loss,
<lb/>For, when they perish, that will perish too.
<lb/>That praise of us remaineth is enough,
<lb/>For crown and girdle are another’s share.
<lb/>Thou needest innocence and uprightness
<lb/>That thine enjoyments prove not scath to thee.
<lb/>My years exceed already eight and thirty,
<lb/>And many a day hath fleeted in delight,
<lb/>But, after two score years, grief for the day
<lb/>Of death is instant with us. If one hair
<lb/>Turn white upon our heads we must forgo
<lb/>All hope of joy; when musk becometh camphor
<lb/>‘Tis ruined; camphor suiteth not the crown.
<lb/>Two years more will I spend in feast and sport,
<lb/>Then, when my strength is somewhat broken, go
<lb/>Before God’s presence, don the woollen robe,
<lb/>And be not thankless for His mercies to me,
<lb/>For I have passed my days in joy and had
<lb/>My share of royal crown. Now for the rose,
<lb/>The apple, the pomegranate, and the quince!
<lb/>Let not the golden goblet fail of wine!


<note>1 The Emperor Babar (A.D. 1483-1530) in his diary made similar
good resolutions, which he did not keep: <quote>As I intend, when forty
years old, to abstain from wine ; and as I now want somewhat less than
one year of being forty, I drink wine most copiously.</quote> EHI, iv. 226.</note>
<pb n="76"/>


<lb/>But when I see the apples amber-cheeked,
<lb/>The heavens dappled like a leopard’s back,
<lb/>The fragrant camomile producing seed,
<lb/>And wine as ruddy as the reveller,
<lb/>When air is pleasant, neither hot nor cold,
<lb/>Earth fresh and water blue, what time we don
<lb/>Our autumn furs, I must to Jaz to hunt,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1536"/>
<lb/>And hold a hunting-bout upon that plain
<lb/>To make me a memorial in the world.
<lb/>Meanwhile the onager will grow plump-necked,
<lb/>And compass lion’s heart and tiger’s strength.
<lb/>We must take dogs and cheetahs, hawks and falcons,<note n="1">Two sorts of falcons are mentioned in the text—the charkh and
<lb/>the shéhin (falco sacer and falco peregrinator?).</note>
<lb/>For that far faring since it is the spot
<lb/>For onager and archery, and there
<lb/>No moment will we rest from chevying.
<lb/>The plain that I have set mine eyes upon
<lb/>Is lower Jaz. There tamarisks are tall
<lb/>As spear-shafts, there too we shall find the lion,
<lb/>And have a hunting if we bide our time.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He waited till the clouds of Shahrivar
<lb/>Arose, then all the world was filled with troops.
<lb/>From every clime an army keen for strife
<lb/>Set face toward the monarch of Iran,
<lb/>Who chose among them chiefs of note as hunters,
<lb/>And carried with him to the chase a force
<lb/>Of thirty thousand mounted Scimitars.
<lb/>They took with them pavilions, tent-enclosures,
<lb/>Tents, beasts, and shielings, while the underlings
<lb/>Went on before Bahram Gar to dig wells,
<lb/>To furnish them withal with wheel and bucket,
<lb/>And run the water into troughs. The Shah
<lb/>Came later with his meiny to the chase.
<lb/>He saw the plain well stocked with onager,
<lb/>The woods alive with lions, and thus said:—

<pb n="77"/>

<lb/><q>Wine is our quarry to-night, for on the sand
<lb/>Are many lion-tracks, and we must have
<lb/>A lion-hunt to-morrow. Rest ye then
<lb/>In health of body and in merry pin,
<lb/>And let us drink till daybreak, till the sun—
<lb/>The lustre of the world—is bright again.
<lb/>Our scimitars shall fell the lions first,
<lb/>Shall fell those valiant dragons. When the woods
<lb/>Are cleared of lions then the onager
<lb/>Shall yield himself a servant to my shafts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He stayed that night and, when the morning dawned,
<lb/>Approached the forest with his men, whereat
<lb/>A lion, lusty-grown with battening
<lb/>On onagers, rushed forth, and brave Bahram
<lb/>Said to his friends: "Though I have bow and arrows,
<lb/>And mastery therewith, I will assail
<lb/>Yon lion with the scimitar that none
<lb/>May call me coward."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Donning a shrunk vest
<lb/>Of wool he mounted on his battle-steed.
<lb/>Now when that dragon of a lion saw him
<lb/>It reared, brought down its claws, and sought to strike
<lb/>The charger on the head.<note n="1">Blanford describes a lioness attacking his horse much in this way,
<lb/>and remarks that Persian sporting pictures generally represent the lion
<lb/>as leaping, not rearing. EP, ii. 32.</note> The warrior heeled
<lb/>His steed and with his trenchant scimitar,
<lb/>What while the lioness made off apace,

<milestone unit="calced" n="1537"/>
<lb/>Struck at the lion’s head and clave the beast
<lb/>Down to its middle, filling lions’ hearts
<lb/>With fear; yet gallantly another one
<lb/>Came roaring, one whose mate was suckling cubs.
<lb/>He smote that lion’s neck and parted head
<lb/>From trunk. One said to him: "O sun-faced Shah!
<lb/>Hast thou not any mercy on thyself?
<lb/>The wood is full of lions and their young—

<pb n="78"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Cubs that are sucklings. Let the lions be,
<lb/>For in the autumn-time they breed. This forest
<lb/>Is three leagues deep, and if thou wert to spend
<lb/>A year in taking lions wouldst not clear it;
<lb/>So why impose such labour on thyself?
<lb/>The Shah, when first he sat upon the throne,
<lb/>Fought lions only as the compact was.<note n="1">See Vol. vi. p. 405 seq.</note>
<lb/>Now thou art Shah, the world is thine, so why
<lb/>Fight with them still? Thou came’st for onager."
<lb/>"Old sage," the Shah said, "let to-morrow dawn,
<lb/>And heigh for onager and shaft and me!
<lb/>But cavaliers and nobles now alive
<lb/>Can rival me in archery, so when
<lb/>We give its due to manhood we must take
<lb/>Account of iron mace and scimitar."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The archmage said: "Hadst thou ten horsemen with thee,
<lb/>And like thee in the fight, then Rum and Chin
<lb/>Would have no crown and throne, and men of wisdom
<lb/>Would ship their goods off. Be the evil eye
<lb/>Far from thy Grace, and be it thine to feast
<lb/>Among the roses."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Then with archimages,
<lb/>And captains of the host, the Shah departed
<lb/>Toward his tent-enclosure from the wood
<lb/>What while the troops acclaimed him, saying thus:—
<lb/>"Ne’er may the crown and signet-ring lack thee."
</p>
<p>
<lb/>That paladin then entered his pavilion,
<lb/>His escort quitting him, and washed his hands
<lb/>Of sweat. He had with him a trusty steward,
<lb/>Who draped a fresh tent for him. There they set
<lb/>Musk, camphor, and rose-water, and spread musk
<lb/>Withal upon the sleeping-place. Each tent
<lb/>Had golden tables laid with services
<lb/>Of ware of Chin where lamb and other meats

<pb n="79"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Were served by the chief server. Shah Bahram Gur,
<lb/>The eating done, called for a mighty cup
<lb/>Of crystal, which a fairy-faced cup-bearer
<lb/>Brought and consigned it to the just king’s hands,
<lb/>Who said: <q>“Ardshir, the great king, he whose fortune
<lb/>Made old folk young, was founder of our house,
<lb/>And we are underlings if we be worthy
<lb/>E’en of that title. Both in fight and feast,
<lb/>At counsel and at board, give none but him
<lb/>The title of world’s lord. What time Sikandar
<milestone unit="calced" n="1538"/>
<lb/>Came to Iran from Rum and wrecked the land,
<lb/>Since he was both ungenerous and harsh,
<lb/>And slew kings six and thirty, monarchs’ lips
<lb/>Are full of curses, and earth’s surface full
<lb/>Of vengeance, on him. Faridan they praise,
<lb/>And he is cursed by stirrers up of strife.
<lb/>Throughout the world may only good proceed
<lb/>From me to small and great. Bring me a herald,”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He added, <q>“one of goodly voice and leading,
<lb/>Let him go round the host and thus proclaim
<lb/>O’er way and waste alike: 'Whoe’er shall lay
<lb/>Within the region of Barkth and Jaz
<lb/>Unlawful hands on aught, from jewels, gold,
<lb/>Dinars, and furs to mean and worthless chaff,
<lb/>Him will I horse face tail-wards and will have
<lb/>Two of the soldiery to lead him hence.
<lb/>His feet shall be made fast beneath his steed,
<lb/>And to the temple of Azargashasp
<lb/>Will I dispatch him there to supplicate
<lb/>All-holy God and worship in the dust
<lb/>Before the Fire. I will bestow his goods
<lb/>On those whom he hath robbed and wronged withal.
<lb/>If any horse shall injure growing crops,
<lb/>Or harm fruit-bearing trees, the horse’s owner,
<pb n="80"/>
<lb/>Be he a noble or of no account,
<lb/>Shall not escape a year’s imprisonment.
<lb/>My work is but to carry from the desert
<lb/>My portion, then go home again rejoicing.'”</q>
</p><p>
<lb/>The more part of the traffickers of Jaz,
<lb/>And of Barkth, went out upon the plain,
<lb/><lb/>And with their various packs produced a scene
About the host like a bazar in Chin.

</p>

<head>§ 18</head>
<p>
<lb/>How Bahram went to hunt the Onager, showed his Skill before
<lb/>the Princes, and returned to Baghdad and Istakhr
<lb/>Whenas the sun next day displayed its crown
<lb/>The world-lord went to hunt the onager;
<lb/>The soldiers strung their bows, the Shah himself
<lb/>Rode in the rear. He said: <q>“If one should take
<lb/>His bow to shoot at any beast the arrow
<lb/>Should strike the buttocks and come through the breast.”</q>
<lb/>A paladin replied: <q>“O king! consider
<lb/>Who in this noble host can shoot like that
<lb/>Among thy friends or foes unless indeed
<milestone unit="calced" n="1539"/>

<lb/>Thou shoot in person. May thy head and crown
<lb/>For ever live. When thou tak’st mace and arrow,
<lb/>And scimitar, thy warriors are awe-struck
<lb/>At thy commanding height and royal Grace,
<lb/>While other archers’ hands lose all their strength.”</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah said: <q>"'Tis of God. If He withdraw it,
<lb/>What strength hath then Bahram?"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He urged Shabdiz,
<lb/>And, nearing a buck onager, let fly
<lb/>His arrow, when the moment came, and skewered
<lb/>Together chest and buttock. As it died
<pb n="81"/>
<lb/>The nobles of the golden belt came up;
<lb/>They marvelled at his shot, and all applauded,
<lb/>They could not see the arrow’s point and feathers,
<lb/>For they were hidden in the onager.
<lb/>The warlike cavaliers and soldiers bent
<lb/>With faces to the ground before Bahram,
<lb/>What while a paladin exclaimed: <q>"O king!
<lb/>Ne’er may thine eye behold the ill of fortune.
<lb/>Thou art a horseman but all we ride asses,
<lb/>And are but ill at that!"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah replied:—
<lb/><q>"Not mine the arrow, for the All-conqueror
<lb/>Assisteth me. None in the world is viler
<lb/>Than one whose prop and helper God is not."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He urged his charger onward, thou hadst said:—
<lb/><q>"Yon courser is an eagle in its flight!"</q>
<lb/>A gallant onager appeared. Forthwith
<lb/>The Lion reached out for his scimitar,
<lb/>And with a sword-stroke clave the beast asunder
<lb/>In equal halves. Chiefs, nobles, and attendants
<lb/>Armed with the scimitar, came up to him,
<lb/>And, when they saw that stroke, a sage exclaimed:—
<lb/><q>"What swordsmanship and might are here! Oh! may
<lb/>The evil eye ne’er look upon this Shah.
<lb/>He hath no semblance save the moon in heaven,"</q>
<note n="1">"il ne laissera peut-être pas la lune dans le ciel." Mohl.</note>
<lb/>Beneath him are the heads of this world’s chiefs,
<lb/>While heaven is lower than his scimitar,
<lb/>And arrow-point."
<lb/>The troops that followed him
<lb/>Cleared all the plain of onager. He bade
<lb/>Make rings of gold and grave his name thereon.
<lb/>He ringed the creatures’ ears and let them go;
<lb/>Six hundred too he branded in a batch,
<lb/>Then freed them for the honour of his name,
<lb/>And for his will and pleasure, while a man
<pb n="82"/>
<lb/>Went round the host proclaiming thus: <q>"Let none
<lb/>Sell to the merchants any onagers
<lb/>On this broad plain but give them as a gift."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>They brought him from Barkah and from the chiefs
<lb/>Of Jaz abundance of brocade and furs.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1540"/>
<lb/>These he accepted and then bade remit
<lb/>Those countries’ tax and toll though both could pay.
<lb/>Their poor and those that earned their bread grew rich
<lb/>By reason of his bounty. Many too
<lb/>Had thrones and crowns. He went home from the chase,
<lb/>And passed a week in mirth among his men.
<lb/>It was his wont to hold an open court
<lb/>Upon the riding-ground, and thither used
<lb/>To fare the troops, the men of eloquence,
<lb/>The wise, the needy, and the suppliants.
<lb/><q>"O ye that seek your rights!"</q> he used to say,
<lb/><q>"Take shelter from your enemies with God,
<lb/>While ye that have not slept through toil for me,
<lb/>And yet have had no portion of my wealth,
<lb/>Come to the king upon the riding-ground,
<lb/>And haply he will make your fortunes new.
<lb/>If any one is old, past work, and weak,
<lb/>Or, being young, is crippled by disease;
<lb/>If any of the people be in debt,
<lb/>And worried by the stress of creditors;
<lb/>If any children are left fatherless,
<lb/>And yet ask not of those possessed of wealth;
<lb/>Or if the children’s mothers are in want
<lb/>In secret and conceal their poverty;
<lb/>Or if, again, a wealthy man hath died,
<lb/>And left behind young children in this land,
<lb/>Whom an executor, devoid of fear
<lb/>And reverence for God, is plundering,
<lb/>Keep nothing of this kind concealed from me;
<lb/>I want not people that conceal their wants.
<pb n="83"/>
<lb/>I will enrich the poor, I will restore
<lb/>The souls of misbelievers to the Faith;
<lb/>I will defray the debts of those who have
<lb/>No money and whose hearts are sad, and open
<lb/>My treasury’s door to modest indigence.
<lb/>If wrong befall from officers of mine
<lb/>Defrauding children that have lost their sires,
<lb/>Those doers of injustice will I gibbet
<lb/>Alive for wronging one of noble race."</q>
</p>


<p>
<lb/>The Shah, advanced in wisdom and glad-hearted,
<lb/>Went from the hunting-field toward Baghdad,<note>Cf. Vol. vi. p. 254.</note>
<lb/>And to his presence came the haughty chiefs,
<lb/>Both alien and those akin to him.
<lb/>He bade his retinue disperse and sought
<lb/>His own delightsome palace. They adorned
<lb/>The bower of Barzin, the handmaids there
<lb/>Were clamorous for musk and wine, the Idols
<lb/>Got ready song and harp, the hall was cleared
<lb/>Of strangers. What with harp and wine and pipe,
<lb/>And sound of song, the vaulted heaven seemed
<lb/>To greet the air. All night from every chamber
<lb/>They brought forth bands of dancers that the Shah
<milestone unit="calced" n="1541"/>
<lb/>Might be not sad of heart. He spent two weeks
<lb/>In mirth, and oped his treasury day and night,
<lb/>Gave largess, and departed for Istakhr,
<lb/>Placed on his head the glorious, royal crown,
<lb/>Unlocked the bower of Kharrad, and furnished
<lb/>The Idols there with treasure and with drachms.
<lb/>If any in that golden women’s house
<lb/>Had not a crown aloft an ivory throne
<lb/>The monarch of Iran growled mightily,
<lb/>Bit at Razbih his lip in indignation,
<lb/>And said: <q>"The tribute from Khazar and Ram
<lb/>I give, when paid, to these, but for the nonce
<lb/>Now requisition ass-loads of dinars,
<pb n="84"/>
<lb/>And treasure-loads from Ispahan and Rai.
<lb/>A women’s house when in such case as this
<lb/>Will grow all desolate and not befit
<lb/>The fortunes of the monarch of Iran."</q>
<lb/>They spread brocade upon the floor, and caused
<lb/>Fresh tribute to be paid in every land.
<lb/>The world thus passed awhile an easy life—
<lb/>No war, no toil, no conflict, and no strife.
</p>

<head>§ 19 How the Khan of Chin led forth a Host to war with Bahram, and how the Iranians asked Quarter of the Khan and submitted to him</head>
<p>

<lb/>Anon news came to Hind, Rum, Turkistan,
<lb/>Chin, and all parts inhabited: <q>"The heart
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram is given up to sport,
<lb/>He taketh no account of any one,
<lb/>He hath no outposts, no men are on guard,
<lb/>And on the marches are no paladins.
<lb/>For love of sport he suffereth all to drift,
<lb/>And knoweth nothing of the world’s affairs."</q>
<lb/>Now when the Khan of Chin heard this he levied
<lb/>Troops from Khutan and Chin, paid them, and set
<lb/>His face toward Iran. No one took thought
<lb/>About Bahram while Caesar for his part
<lb/>Marched forth in force from Rum. When tidings reached
<lb/>Iran from Rum and Hind, from Chin and all
<lb/>The settled regions: <q>"Caesar hath assembled
<lb/>And led an army forth while troops are seen
<lb/>Advancing from Khutan and Chin,"</q> the chieftains,
<lb/>The warriors old and young within Iran,
<lb/>All came before Bahram Gur, full of wrath,
<lb/>Of rage, and bitterness, and bluntly said:—
<pb n="85"/>
<lb/><q>"Thy glorious fortune hath displayed its back.
<lb/>The heads of kings should be intent on fighting,
<lb/>But thy heart is intent on sport and feasting;
<lb/>The crown and throne are worthless in thine eyes,
<lb/>So are Iran, the treasure, and the host.”</q></p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1542"/>    


<p>
<lb/>The Shah, the ruler of the world, thus answered
<lb/>Those archimages, his admonishers:—
<lb/><q>"My helper is the Master of the world,
<lb/>One who is wiser than the wisest sages.
<lb/>I by the conquering virtue of great kings
<lb/>Will guard Iran against the claws of Wolves;
<lb/>By fortune, host, wealth, scimitar will I
<lb/>Avert this pain and travail from the realm."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He toyed on just the same, his nobles’ eyes
<lb/>Were full of blood through him, and all folk said:—
<lb/><q>"This Shah will alienate all good men’s hearts."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Yet Shah Bahram’s heart was awake and full
<lb/>Of trouble at the tidings. Secretly
<lb/>He organised the host while folk at large
<lb/>Knew not his privy purpose. All Iran
<lb/>Was in dismay at what they saw of him;
<lb/>Their hearts were riven by anxiety;
<lb/>They all were in despair about the king,
<lb/>And held his rule and person in contempt.
<lb/>Now when the Khan was drawing nigh Iran,
<lb/>News of him reached the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>Who called to him the aspiring Gustaham,
<lb/>And spake much of the Khan and of his host.
<lb/>This Gustaham was paladin in chief,
<lb/>And minister, and fight came as a feast
<lb/>To him. The Shah called Mihr Piruz withal,
<lb/>Son of Bihzad, he called too Mahyar Barzin,
<lb/>Son of Kharrad, Bahram, son of Piruz,
<lb/>Son of Bahram, Ruhham and Kharzarwan,
<lb/>Which twain were of Sasanian lineage,
<lb/>One king of Rai, and of Gilan the other,
<pb n="86"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Who stood up stoutly on the day of battle,
<lb/>With Rad, son of Barzin, approved in fight,
<lb/>Who was the ruler of Zabulistan,
<lb/>Karan too and Burzin and Dara the grim,
<lb/>Son of Barzin, while of the Iranians
<lb/>He chose him out a hundred thousand men,
<lb/>Men of discretion, well beseen in war,
<lb/>Committing to a scion of the race
<lb/>In power—Narsi, the brother of the Shah
<lb/>So pure of Faith—those cavaliers and throne
<lb/>And crown that he might guard the treasury
<lb/>And realm. Narsi, that man of noble mien,
<lb/>Possessed of Grace and Faith and loving looks,
<lb/>Took up the charge, and thereupon the Shah
<lb/>Chose from the host twelve thousand cavaliers
<lb/>Fit for the day of battle—veterans
<lb/>With ox-head maces and in coats of mail—
<lb/>And marched thence to Azarabadagan;
<lb/>But, as he took from Pars so small a host,
<lb/>The mighty and the common folk alike
<lb/>Thought: "Shah Bahram is fleeing from the fight,
<lb/>And making off toward Azargashasp."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>What time Bahram set face toward the Fire
<lb/>From Caesar came an envoy swift as wind.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1543"/>
<lb/>Narsi received and lodged him fittingly
<lb/>Within the palace.
<lb/>Now the host approached
<lb/>The high priest to get knowledge of Bahram,
<lb/>And said: "Why scattereth he his treasures thus
<lb/>Instead of heaping them like other Shahs?
<lb/>He squandereth gold everywhere because
<lb/>He knoweth not its worth. Both citizens
<lb/>And soldiers are dispersed, and all have sought
<lb/>Some course of betterment."
</p>

<p>
<lb/>At length, when words
<lb/>Had waxen old, all folk agreed to send
<pb n="87"/>
<lb/>A man of reputation to the Khan
<lb/>Of Chin, <q>"Because,"</q> said they, <q>"'ere evils come
<lb/>With war and pillage we must try all means
<lb/>To save Iran: the master of the house
<lb/>Is lost."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Narsi replied: <q>"This is not well;
<lb/>The world hath not a bed for such a stream.
<lb/>Shall I ask quarter of the king of Chin?
<lb/>I will clothe earth with men and elephants.
<lb/>There are arms, treasure, and courageous men,
<lb/>Whose swords would send dust out of fire itself.
<lb/>Why this despair concerning Shah Bahram
<lb/>Because he started with a little band?
<lb/>Why have your thoughts turned evil thus? If ye
<lb/>Think ill then ill will come."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Iranians heard,
<lb/>And answered him perversely, saying: <q>"Bahram,
<lb/>Departing hence, took not a host with him,
<lb/>And must we not resign our hearts to grief,
<lb/>For when the Khan shall come to fight Iran
<lb/>Our land will lose both scent and hue? The foe
<lb/>Will trample on us shamefully, Narsi
<lb/>And all the host will be o’erthrown. All means
<lb/>Will we endeavour to maintain our place
<lb/>And standing here."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>There was an archimage,
<lb/>A skilful, learned, single-hearted man,
<lb/>Humai by name, and him the Iranians chose
<lb/>To gird his loins and undertake their cause,
<lb/>Then wrote the Khan upon their own behalf
<lb/>A cringing letter which began: <q>"Thy slaves
<lb/>Are we and bow down to thy will and pleasure.
<lb/>We send thee of the produce of Iran
<lb/>Together with our homage and excuses,
<lb/>With gifts too, toll and tribute, for we have
<lb/>No power to stand against the king in war."</q>
<pb n="88"/>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>So from Iran the blest Humai arrived
<lb/>With certain nobles—men of honest counsels—
<lb/>And gave the Khan the message of the chiefs,
<lb/>Whereat his heart rejoiced. Humai withal
<lb/>Spake of the swift remove of Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And of his hasty flight without a host,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1544"/>
<lb/>Before the noble Khan whose heart and soul
<lb/>Expanded like a rose. He told the Turkmans: <q>"Now we have saddled the revolving sky!
<lb/>Who ever took Iran without a fight
<lb/>As we have by our counsel, wit, and patience?"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He gave great presents to the messenger,
<lb/>Drachms and no few dinars, and wrote this answer: <q>"May wisdom company the pure of soul.
<lb/>I do agree to what hath been proposed
<lb/>By this ambassador of honest men.
<lb/>When with my host I reach Marv I will make
<lb/>The clime like pheasant's plumes,"</q><note>Because <foreign>tadarv</foreign>, <gloss>pheasant</gloss>, rhymes with <foreign>Marv</foreign>."</note> <q>"and streams run
<lb/>milk"</q><note>Reading with P. and T.</note><q>"By justice, prudence, and magnificence.
<lb/>I will await the tribute from Iran—
<lb/>The Lions' gifts and taxes. I shall come
<lb/>To Marv, or rather I shall pass it by,
<lb/>Not wishing to cause damage by my troops."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The messenger returned in haste and told
<lb/>His converse with the Khan who led his host
<lb/>To Marv, the world was black with horsemen's dust.
<lb/>When he had rested he concerned himself
<lb/>With feasting; no one thought about Bahram.
<lb/>At Marv there was no rest or sleep for sound
<lb/>Of harp and lyre, the troops were all abroad.
<lb/>There was no watch, no prospect of a shock,
<lb/>But all was sport, wine, parties, twang of lyre,
<lb/>And feeling night and day secure from war.
<pb n="89"/>
<lb/>The Khan was looking for the Iranians' tribute.
<lb/>Wroth that it came so late. Bahram for his part
<lb/>Slept not but guarded well his host from foes,
<lb/>Kept his spies busy both by night and day,
<lb/>And threw in feast and wine no time away.
</p>


<head>§ 20 How Bahram attacked the Host of the Khan and took him</head>

<p>
<lb/>As soon as tidings came to Shah Bahram:
<lb/><q>"The Khan and his great host are all at Marv,"</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He led his soldiers from Azargashasp,
<lb/>Each with two horses but no baggage-train.
<lb/>With Ruman helmet, morion, and cuirass
<lb/>He hurried on like wind by day and night,
<lb/>His soldiers rushing like a mountain-stream,
<lb/>And reached Amul by way of Ardabil.
<lb/>Departing thence he marched on to Gurgan,
<lb/>Enduring all the chieftains’ toil and pain,
<lb/>And thence came to the city of Nisa;
<lb/>One from Bisa preceded him as guide.
<lb/>O’er mount and waterless and wayless tracts,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1545"/>
<lb/>At times unwonted, through the night till morn,
<lb/>He marched and had the watch out night and day.
<lb/>Thus swifter than a pheasant<note>See p. 88, note.</note> in its flight
<lb/>He drew toward Marv. A runner from his scouts
<lb/>Arrived and told: <q>"The Khan attendeth not
<lb/>To state-affairs but followeth the chase
<lb/>At Kashmihan with wicked Ahriman
<lb/>As minister."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>Bahram rejoiced to hear it;
<lb/>His travail seemed but wind. There for a day
<lb/>He rested and, when steed and Shah and troops

<pb n="90"/>

<lb/>Were all refreshed, reached Kashmihan. At dawn,
<lb/>What time the Lustre of the world arose
<lb/>Above the hills, all ears were filled with blast
<lb/>Of trumpet and all eyes with glint of flag-tops,
<lb/>The din of battle went up from the chase,
<lb/>And filled the ears of Shah and troops. The clamour
<lb/>Split mighty lions’ ears. Thou wouldst have said:
<lb/><q>'The clouds are hailing," wouldst have said: "The moon
<lb/>Is raining blood,"</q> so sanguine was the dust
<lb/>Upon that battlefield! The Khan, aroused
<lb/>And dazed, was ta’en by Khazarwén. Withal
<lb/>Three hundred of the noblemen of Chin
<lb/>Were captured and fast bound on saddle-back.
<lb/>The Shah advanced on Marv from Kashmihan,
<lb/>Thin as a reed with riding for so long.
<lb/>The few of Chin that yet remained at Marv
<lb/>They slew. He followed up the fugitives
<lb/>For thirty leagues; behind him was Karan
<lb/>Of Pars. Returning to the hunting-ground
<lb/>He gave the booty to the troops. When thus
<lb/>He raised his head in triumph over Chin
<lb/>He recognised in all the power of God,
<lb/>Who to his other good had given the boon
<lb/>Of might, and is the Lord of sun and moon.
</p>

<head>§ 21 How Bahram took a Pledge from the Turanians, how he set up
a Pillar to delimit the Realm, and placed Shahra upon the
Throne of Turan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur stayed to rest at Marv and when
<lb/>Both Shah and war-steed were refreshed he chose
<lb/>Bukhara for the next attack, for he
<pb n="91"/>
<lb/>Had changed from gentleness to bitterness.
<lb/>He reached Amwi<note>Probably the modern Charjui.</note> in one day and one night,
<lb/>Intent on conquest not on chase and sport.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1546"/>
<lb/>He reached it in the night’s first watch and crossed
<lb/>The river<note>The Oxus.</note> and the desert of Farab.
<lb/>Whenas the air was golden with the sun,
<lb/>And doffed its skirt of lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>The world was like a falcon’s wing with dust
<lb/>What time the world-lord passed by Mai and Margh.
<lb/>He smote the Turkman host and set on fire
<lb/>Their fields and fells, the stars concealed themselves
<lb/>Behind the moon’s skirts while the fathers made
<lb/>Their way across the bodies of their sons.
<lb/>All of the Turkmans that were leading men,
<lb/>Both veteran and youthful swordsmen, came
<lb/>Afoot in evil case before Bahram,
<lb/>With full hearts abjectly, and said: <q>"O Shah!
<lb/>O mighty one! O favourite of the stars!
<lb/>O chief of all the nobles of the world!
<lb/>Since now the Khan is captive that broke faith
<lb/>Shed not the blood of those that did no wrong,
<lb/>For tyranny becometh not the great.
<lb/>If thou demandest tribute it is well,
<lb/>But why behead the guiltless? All of us,
<lb/>Both men and women, are thy slaves and are
<lb/>Thy vanquished in the fight."</q>
</p>

<p>
<lb/>The Shah’s heart burned
<lb/>For them. He sewed up with the hand of wisdom
<lb/>The eye of his displeasure. In concern
<lb/>That man of God restrained his warriors’ hands
<lb/>From shedding blood. His favour thus secured,
<lb/>The man of wrath appeased, the leading chiefs
<lb/>Agreed to pay a heavy tribute yearly.
<lb/>The Shah was well content; he took the tribute,
<lb/>And further sums in lieu of pillaging.

<pb n="92"/>
<lb/>He turned and reached the city of Farab,
<lb/>His cheeks were flushed and smiles were on his lips.
<lb/>He paused, allowed his troops to rest a week,
<lb/>And called to him the potentates of Chin.
<lb/>He reared a column of cement and stone,
<lb/>Which none, save by the Shah’s command, might pass
<lb/>Out of Iran, Khalaj, and Turkistan.
<lb/>He made the line between them the Jihun.
<lb/>There was among the troops one Shahra hight,
<lb/>A man of wisdom, rank, success, and fame.
<lb/>Bahram made him the ruler of Turan,
<lb/>And made his throne the crown upon the moon.
<lb/>When Shahra sat upon the silver throne
<lb/>He girt his loins and opened wide his hands,
<lb/>Set too the golden crown upon his head,
<lb/>And through the land joy universal spread.
</p>

<head>§ 22 How Bahram wrote to announce his Victory to his Brother Narsi and returned to Iran</head>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1547"/>
<lb/>The business of Turan achieved, and when
<lb/>The Shah’s heart was released from care, he bade
<lb/>A scribe attend him, called for pen and ink
<lb/>And silk of Chin, and wrote Narsi a letter
<lb/>About the Turkman war and what his troops
<lb/>Had done. It thus began: <q>The nobles praise
<lb/>Through me—a slave—the Maker of the world—
<lb/>The Lord of victory and mastery,
<lb/>The Lord of Saturn, Mars, and Moon, the Lord
<lb/>Of lofty, circling heaven, the Lord of mean
<lb/>And miserable dust. The great and lowly
<lb/>Are underneath His governance, and all
<lb/>That is to be is subject to His word.
<pb n="93"/>
<lb/>I have indited from the coasts of Chin
<lb/>A letter to my brother in Iran,
<lb/>And this same letter, writ on painted silk,
<lb/>Is meant too for our chiefs and folk at large.
<lb/>Those that were not engaged against the Khan
<lb/>Must hear the tale from us who fought with him.
<lb/>His army was so vast that thou hadst said:
<lb/><q>'The dust thereof hath smeared the sky with pitch!'</q>
<lb/>The coasts became as ’twere a sea of blood,
<lb/>The unjust’s fortune drooped, and he was taken
<lb/>Because<note>Reading with P.</note> the turning sky was weary of him.
<lb/>Now have I brought him on a camel bound,
<lb/>With wounded liver and with blood-filled eyes.
<lb/>The necks of all the proud are bent, their tongues
<lb/>Are gentle, and their hearts are hot within them.
<lb/>Those now pay tribute who were enemies,
<lb/>And they that erred have come back to the way.
<lb/>I and my host, as my well-wishers would,
<lb/>Will follow this dispatch.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The wind-foot camels,
<lb/>Foam-scattering, parted like a thunder-clap,
<lb/>And when the letter reached Narsi the heart
<lb/>Of that prince throbbed with joy. The high priest came
<lb/>With all the heroes of the royal race
<lb/>Before Narsi, the palace rang with joy,
<lb/>And all gave ear to that report. The nobles
<lb/>Were pricked at heart for shame before the Shah
<lb/>By reason of their fault. Among the chiefs
<lb/>Six score and ten and more went to Narsi
<lb/>To proffer their excuses, saying thus:
<lb/><q>'Perverse suggestions and the Div’s behest
<lb/>Have led us to transgress the World-lord’s way.
<lb/>To such a host as that one would presume
<lb/>That God would ope Heaven’s gate. ’Tis marvellous,
<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1548"/>
<lb/>Surpassing thought and all the providence
<lb/>Of wise and learnéd men! In thy reply,
<lb/>’"Mongst matters fair and foul, vouchsafe to give
<lb/>A place to our excuse. Although the chiefs
<lb/>Have erred the illustrious Shah may pardon them.'</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Narsi agreed and said: <q>'So will I do
<lb/>As to release the Shah’s heart from revenge.'</q>
<lb/>He wrote at once an answer to the letter,
<lb/>Disclosing matters fair and foul, and said:
<lb/><q>'The Iranians in their pain and misery,
<lb/>And for the sake of country, children, treasure,
<lb/>Went for protection to the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Despairing of their own illustrious Shah;
<lb/>'Twas not through enmity, offence, or strife;
<lb/>No other Shah had gained their preference.
<lb/>Now if the conqueror, the king of kings,
<lb/>Will pardon he will make their dark night day.
<lb/>Me they selected as the advocate
<lb/>To urge their cause, and bade me: ‘Plead for us.’</q>
<lb/>An archimage, by name Burzmihr, agreed
<lb/>To go upon that embassage, approached
<lb/>The monarch of the world, and told him all.
<lb/>The Shah was well contented by the words,
<lb/>The fire of his fierce anger ceased to fume.
<lb/>Then from Chaghan, Khatlan, Balkh, and Bukhara
<lb/>The chieftains went with tribute, and the archmages
<lb/>From the Gharchis with sacred twigs, and pleaded
<lb/>Before the worshippers of Fire, and thus
<lb/>From year to year all those that had the means
<lb/>Went to the court with taxes and with tribute.
<lb/>When the Fire-fane was ready and the place
<lb/>To hold the feasts of New Year and of Sada
<lb/>The Shah approached Azar Abadagan,
<lb/>He and his nobles and his men of name;
<lb/>They went to make their prayers before the Fire,
<lb/>And all the archmages offered reverence.

<lb/>The Shah gave largess to the worshippers,
<lb/>And passing thence proceeded to Istakhr,
<lb/>Which was the glory of the king of kings.
<lb/>From ox-hides and from sheep-skins, borne before him
<lb/>Upon the backs of elephants, were scattered
<lb/>A thousand quintals and eight score of largess;
<lb/>Part was in drachms, the rest in gold dinars—
<lb/>Coin that an archimage of Pars would call
<lb/>In ancient Persian “paidawasis.”<note>The <foreign>paidawasi</foreign> was a silver coin=to five dinars.</note> Then
<lb/>He brought his scented leather bags of coin,
<lb/>And lavished gold and silver. If he saw
<lb/>Upon a journey any broken bridge,
<lb/>Or heard of any hostelry in ruins
<lb/>From his officials, he would give command
<lb/>For their repair out of his treasury
<lb/>Without forced labour. On the poor withal,
<lb/>And those that toiled to earn their daily bread,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1549"/>
<lb/>He lavished drachms, for bounty never irked him,
<lb/>While, thirdly, on the honest folk, the widows,
<lb/>And infant orphans, he showered silver.
<lb/>Fourthly, on those too old for work or warfare,
<lb/>And, fifthly, on all those of noble birth
<lb/>That were despised by wealthy folk, and sixthly
<lb/>On folk that coming from a lengthy journey
<lb/>Paraded not their poverty, he lavished
<lb/>A treasure, and looked round him to do good.
<lb/>All booty he made over to his troops,
<lb/>And had no notion of amassing wealth.
<lb/>He bade a pious archimage to bring him
<lb/>The crown worn by the Khan of Chin. They took
<lb/>The jewels out and used them and the gold
<lb/>To grace a Fire-fane’s walls and decorate
<lb/>The throne-top of Azar. Thence he departed
<lb/>To Taisafan where dwelt Narsi with those
<lb/>Archmages that advised him. All the chiefs,
<pb n="95"/>
<lb/>The great men of Iran, and governors,
<lb/>Came forth to meet the Shah, and when Narsi
<lb/>Beheld that royal head and crown, the flags
<lb/>Resplendent, and that mighty host, he lighted,
<lb/>With all the great men and august archmages,
<lb/>And did obeisance to Bahram who bade him
<lb/>To mount again, and grasped him by the hand,
<lb/>Then went up to the golden throne and sat
<lb/>What while the chiefs stood girded in his presence.
<lb/>He lavished treasure on the indigent,
<lb/>They opened wide the prison’s narrow doors,
<lb/>The age was filled with jollity and justice,
<lb/>The hearts of all were strangers to distress.
<lb/>He banished toil and grief from every clime,
<lb/>He made a banquet for the great, and all
<lb/>That hasted to attend the royal board
<lb/>Received a present worthy of a lord.
</p>

<head>§ 23 How Bahram wrote a Letter of Directions to his Officials</head>
<p>
<lb/>The third day at a feast made for the nobles
<lb/>A scribe was brought and set before the Shah,
<lb/>Who, when his visage was relaxed with wine,
<lb/>Wrote, joying in his lovingkindliness,
<lb/>A letter which began with praise of one
<lb/>That hath with knowledge laved his soul, made wisdom
<lb/>The jewel of his heart, won opulence
<lb/>By his own toil and hardihood, acknowledged
<lb/>That all good is from God, hath sought for wisdom,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1550"/>
<lb/>Made friends of sages, knoweth that from justice
<lb/>Naught will proceed but good, and knocketh not
<lb/>Upon the portal of malignity:—
<pb n="97"/>
<lb/><q>If one complaineth of mine officers,
<lb/>My noble chieftains or my men of war,
<lb/>They have no prospect but the cell or gibbet,
<lb/>And, if slain, vile committal to the dust.
<lb/>Endeavour to make others’ travail small,
<lb/>Give joy and happiness to mourners’ hearts,
<lb/>Because the world hath stayed, will stay, with none;
<lb/>Be just and inoffensive, that sufficeth.
<lb/>I am exemplary of what I say,
<lb/>And an incentive to all righteousness,
<lb/>For what a multitude of troops assailed
<lb/>Me and this noble company, while I
<lb/>Departed with a little host, and those
<lb/>Who were mine enemies are now my friends!
<lb/>One noble personage—the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>A world-lord having signet, crown, and throne—
<lb/>I captured, and the Turkmans’ fortunes fell.
<lb/>All-holy God made me victorious,
<lb/>My foemen’s heads have come to dust. Be service
<lb/>My sole employ, mine every thought be right.
<lb/>I will impose no tax for seven years
<lb/>On subject or compeer. I write this letter
<lb/>In our old tongue to chiefs and to officials
<lb/>That they may treat my subjects in accord
<lb/>To righteous precedent and take no thought
<lb/>Of doing wrong. Dispatch to me the names
<lb/>Of those that are in want within your towns,
<lb/>And in their portion have no day of joy,
<lb/>And well will I content them. Furthermore,
<lb/>If there be any men of noble birth,
<lb/>Who can recall to memory better days,
<lb/>Them also with my treasures set past need,
<lb/>And magnify the wise. The folk in debt,
<lb/>And empty-handed, who are everywhere
<lb/>Looked down upon and scorned, them too relieve
<lb/>Of debt and write their names upon the roll.
<pb n="98"/>
<lb/>Pray ye to God to keep our heart thus true
<lb/>To custom and the Faith, joy in this precept,
<lb/>And well entreat the underlings. Moreover,
<lb/>Despise not your own slaves, for they, like you,
<lb/>Are God’s. Let one of wealth, and fit therefor,
<lb/>Entrust to learnéd men his children. Make
<lb/>Their spirits rich in knowledge and encrown
<lb/>Their heads with wisdom. Keep your hands afar
<lb/>From others’ wealth, be ye without offence,
<lb/>And worshippers of God. Be diligent,
<lb/>Break not our fealty, and eradicate
<lb/>The stumps, the suckers, and the roots of evil.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1551"/>
<lb/>Seek not to do your neighbours injury,
<lb/>Especially the magnates and the rich;
<lb/>Make God your refuge, keep His ordinance,
<lb/>And your souls pledges of your love for Him.
<lb/>Whoever hath grown great from nothingness,
<lb/>And raised himself to independency,
<lb/>Call him not great, such greatness dwindleth soon.
<lb/>Be just, be worshippers of God, and wash
<lb/>Perverseness and injustice from your hands.
<lb/>All ye that have! withhold not from the poor;
<lb/>Incline to holiness and act aright;
<lb/>Break not the hearts and backs of suppliants;
<lb/>Mishap is nigh to all things done amiss.
<lb/>God’s favour be upon the soul of him
<lb/>To whom humanity is warp and woof.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When they had written thus on lustrous silk
<lb/>The scribe dipped into musk his pen and wrote
<lb/>The heading thus: <q>The monarch of the world,
<lb/>The heart of justice, knowing good and ill,
<lb/>The lord of pardon, Grace, and puissance,
<lb/>Bahram Gur, the all-bounteous king of kings,
<lb/>To his marchlords and those beneath his rule—
<lb/>The wise and understanding, warlike chiefs.</q>
</p>
<p>
<pb n="99"/>
<lb/>Then runners, cavaliers, and cameleers
<lb/>Went with the letter everywhere with guides,
<lb/>And when it came to all the provinces,
<lb/>To every nobleman and chief, all said :-
<lb/><q>Thanks be to God, the world-lord is devout.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Thereat the women, men, and children went
<lb/>In all lands from their houses to the plain,
<lb/>And all invoked a blessing silently
<lb/>Upon that upright monarch of the world,
<lb/>Then set themselves to feast and called for wine,
<lb/>And harp and minstrelsy. They feasted half
<lb/>The day, the other half they toiled.
<lb/>At springtide
<lb/>It was proclaimed before the court at dawn :
<lb/><q>Let those of substance eat and give away.
<lb/>Let them thank us for that which they enjoy,
<lb/>And let the poor come to the treasury,
<lb/>And carry thence five drachms of proper weight,
<lb/>Together with three mans<note>Cf. Vol. i. p. 290 note.</note> of bright, old wine
<lb/>Hued like pomegranate-blossom or like gold.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The world disposed itself to merriment,
<lb/>The shouts of revellers filled town and hamlet
<lb/>Until they bought a coronal of roses
<lb/>For two dinars and gave without complaint
<lb/>A drachm for a narcissus-spike. The old
<lb/>Grew young of heart with joy, the streams ran milk.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1552"/>
<lb/>The Shah thanked God on seeing all the world
<lb/>Thus glad.
<lb/>One day he thus addressed Narsi :
<lb/><q>Depart hence with the signet and the crown.
<lb/>I have bestowed upon thee Khurasan;
<lb/>Cause it to flourish; joy our subjects’ hearts;
<lb/>Be nothing if not just; stint not thy hand
<lb/>Within this Place of Passage.<note><cit><quote>n’interromps jamais le passage a travers ce pays.</quote> <bibl>Mohl</bibl></cit></note> If our father
<pb n="100"/>
<lb/>Sought ill he quaked therefor like naked men
<lb/>Beneath an autumn-blast.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He bade prepare
<lb/>A robe of honour for Narsi, thus voiding
<lb/>An opulent treasury, and said to him :
<lb/><q>God shelter thee, and be the sun’s throne thine.</q>
<lb/>The journey took two se’nnights, then Narsi
<lb/>Assumed in peace the rule of Khurasan.
<lb/>When he had gone one week the Shah, whose heart
<lb/>Was freed from care, bade, and the high priest went
<lb/>Before him, bringing certain of the nobles.
<lb/>The Shah addressed him, saying: <q>Ceasar’s business
<lb/>Is dragging on, and his ambassador
<lb/>Is waiting long for his dismission.
<lb/>What sort of man is he, and from the standpoint
<lb/>Of wisdom where is he, for wisdom straighteneth
<lb/>The soul?</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The high priest answered: <q>Blest be thou,
<lb/>Lord of the world, and dowered with Grace divine.
<lb/>He is advanced in years, discreet, and modest,
<lb/>A man of goodly speech and gentle voice,
<lb/>A pupil of the school of Falatun,<note>Plato.</note>
<lb/>A man of wisdom, learned, and nobly born.
<lb/>He left Rum, full of energy, but now,
<lb/>Since he hath been here, he hath grown depressed,
<lb/>And torpid like a snake in winter-time,<note>Literally, "in the month of Dai."</note>
<lb/>With weak frame and with cheeks of reed-like hue.
<lb/>His servitors are all like sheep before
<lb/>A hunting cheetah, but regard not us;
<lb/>Such are their manhood and their valiancy
<lb/>They think none in this land a man at all.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram Gur answered thus the high priest: <q>God
<lb/>Bestoweth Grace and diadem and might.
<lb/>If He hath given me victory, and turned
<lb/>My fortune’s night to day, still Caesar too

<pb n="101"/>
<lb/>Is of imperial race, is great, is sprung
<lb/>From Salm whose head was crowned by Faridan,
<lb/>And can recount his lineage sire by sire.
<lb/>He acteth in a manly, prudent way,
<lb/>And hath not turned to madness like the Khan.
<lb/>At audience we will call the envoy in,
<lb/>To see if what he saith be to the point,
<lb/>And then I will dismiss him graciously,
<lb/>For men are useful to me in this world;
<lb/>One is for war and bringeth troops, another
<lb/>For feasting and doth bring a golden crown.
<lb/>I must maintain the honour of Iran,
<lb/>The man that treateth with great men is great.</q>
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The high priest praised him lovingly and said:-
<lb/><q>Live happily so long as heaven revolveth.
<lb/>He shall not speak save to exalt thy fame:
<lb/>Mayst thou be chief among the men of name.</q>
</p>

<head>§ 24
How Bahram called before him the Envoy of Caesar, and how
the Envoy questioned and answered the Archmages</head>
<p>
<lb/>The next day when the sun displayed its crown,
<lb/>And rays proceeded from the vaulted sky,
<lb/>The monarch of the world sat on his throne,
<lb/>And called the envoy in before his lords.
<lb/>That old man sage, experienced, eloquent,
<lb/>Of understanding and retentive mind,
<lb/>Approaching with dejected head and arms
<lb/>Enfolded, kneeled before the monarch’s throne.
<lb/>Bahram both greeted and made much of him,
<lb/>Set him upon the turquoise throne and said :—
<lb/>“Here thou hast sojourned long; art thou not weary
<lb/>Of looking on this land? War with the Khan,
<pb n="102"/>
<lb/>Which closely partnered me, withheld me from thee;
<lb/>Now all our case is altered, and thy sojourn
<lb/>Exceedeth bounds. To that which thou shalt say
<lb/>We will reply, deriving from thy words
<lb/>Good rede.”’
<lb/>The ancient envoy praised him, saying :—
<lb/>"May time and earth ne’er lose thee. Every king
<lb/>Possessed of wisdom joyeth in the words
<lb/>Of sages; sages are more nigh to God;
<lb/>Those that think evil have the darker day.
<lb/>Midst this world’s chieftains thou art chief, who art
<lb/>At once Shah, chief, and best. Thy tongue’s a balance,
<lb/>Thy words are jewels, and who e’er will see
<lb/>Gems weighed ’gainst gold? Thou art possessed of knowledge,
<lb/>Of counsel, sense, and Grace, and all the methods
<lb/>Of conquering kings; thou art possessed of wisdom
<lb/>And holy rede, and master of the wise.
<lb/>Though Caesar’s envoy I am thy slave’s slave.
<lb/>I carry Caesar’s greeting to the Shah :—
<lb/>‘May this head, throne, and crown forever be.’
<lb/>And furthermore I have it in command
<lb/>To ask seven questions of thy men of lore.”</p>

<p>The Shah replied : ‘Proceed; the highest honours
<lb/>Await the eloquent.” -
<lb/>He bade the high priest
<lb/>Come to his presence with the famous sages,
<lb/>But sighs were on his lips the while in view
<lb/>Of what the man might ask. ‘“What are,” he thought, —
<milestone unit="calced" n="1554"/>
<lb/>“The seven mysterious things whereof this Roman
<lb/>Would question us?”’
<lb/>The high priest with the learned,
<lb/>Men mighty in all lore, came, and the spokesman
<lb/>Revealed the secret, telling to the high priest
<lb/>The words of Caesar: “‘What is ‘the within’
<lb/>In thy nomenclature, what ‘the without,’
<pb n="103"/>
<lb/>O guide, who hast no other name therefor?
<lb/>What is ‘the above,’ my lord, what ‘the beneath’?
<lb/>What is ‘the infinite’ and what ‘the vile’?
<lb/>What hath most names and ruleth everywhere?”’
<lb/>‘Haste not,” the high priest answered thus the sage,
<lb/>‘And turn not from the path of understanding.”</p>

<p>He then proceeded : ‘O thou man of wisdom!
<lb/>Give ear to each reply that I shall make:
<lb/>There is one answer only to thy words.
<lb/>As to thy question touching ‘the without,’
<lb/>And ‘the within,’ it is an easy one:
<lb/>The heaven is ‘the without,’ air ‘the within’;
<lb/>They are the Glory of the Omnipotent;
<lb/>God, touching this world, is ‘the infinite,’
<lb/>For lore to turn thee from Him is ‘the vile’;
<lb/>‘The above’ is Paradise, Hell ‘the beneath,’
<lb/>And he is wicked that doth fear not God.
<lb/>Next as to that with many names whose will
<lb/>Prevaileth everywhere: O ancient! wisdom
<lb/>Hath many names, and wisdom compasseth
<lb/>The will of kings. One man may call it love,
<lb/>Another faith, but in its absence all
<lb/>Is pain and tyranny. The eloquent
<lb/>Term it uprightness and the fortunate
<lb/>Astuteness; ‘tis at whiles long-suffering,
<lb/>At whiles trustworthiness, for speech therewith
<lb/>Is safe. So divers are the names of wisdom
<lb/>That they exceed account. Allow that naught
<lb/>Surpasseth it; it is the chief of goods,
<lb/>And knoweth this world’s hoarded mysteries,
<lb/>Which mortal vision cannot penetrate.
<lb/>Again, the stars that glitter in the sky
<lb/>Are what the master can afford to slight
<lb/>For understanding of the Maker’s work.
<lb/>The eye that gazeth cannot reckon them,
<lb/>And heaven above is unattainable
<pb n="104"/>
<lb/>As being measureless, so thou mayst scorn
<lb/>Such reckonings and processes of Fate.
<lb/>One that can follow not an arrow’s course,
<lb/>Shrewd though he be, will marvel still thereat;
<lb/>Then what can be more futile, favoured sir!
<lb/>Than to compute heaven’s stars? This much I know,
<lb/>And if another replication be
<lb/>'Tis that the Maker’s mysteries are vast.”’
<milestone unit="calced" n="1555"/>
<lb/>When Caesar’s spokesman heard he kissed the ground,
<lb/>And offered praise. ‘‘World-ruling Shah,” he said,
<lb/>‘“Ask nothing more of God, for all the world
<lb/>Is thine to bid, the heads of all the great
<lb/>Are under thy control, the world hath not
<lb/>A king like thee in mind, thou praised by all
<lb/>The high-born nobles! while thy minister
<lb/>In knowledge passeth sage and archimage.
<lb/>All the philosophers are slaves to him,
<lb/>And at his wisdom hang their heads.”’
<lb/>Bahram,
<lb/>On hearing, showed his pleasure, his heart brightened.
<lb/>He bade a robe of honour be made ready
<lb/>Of things most valued in his treasury,
<lb/>And gave the archimage withal ten purses
<lb/>Of drachms with raiment, steed, and much besides,
<lb/>And then the envoy of illustrious Caesar
<lb/>Went from the royal presence to his lodging.
<lb/>When Sol displayed its hand upon the sky
<lb/>The king of kings sat on his golden throne,
<lb/>And Caesar’s envoy came to court, and with him
<lb/>The high priest wise and worshipful. They went
<lb/>With joy before the king of kings, conversing
<lb/>On many matters, and the Shah’s high priest
<lb/>Said to the envoy: “Matchless, peerless sage!
<lb/>What thing is so injurious that we
<lb/>Must weep at its occurrence? What know’st thou
<pb n="105"/>
<lb/>So useful to the world that men become
<lb/>Exalted when it chanceth?”</p>

<p>Said the envoy :—
<lb/>The wise aye will be great and powerful.
<lb/>The person of the foolish is more vile
<lb/>Than clay and undeserving of all good.
<lb/>Thou spakest of the unwise and of the wise,
<lb/>And hast received, maybe, the right response.”</p>

<p>The high priest said to him: “Consider well,
<lb/>Reflect, and put not fish upon the dry.”</p>

<p>The envoy said : “O man approved by all!
<lb/>One well may quote the sayings of the wise,
<lb/>But, if thou knowest another answer, speak,
<lb/>For knowledge giveth increment to fame.”’
<lb/>The high priest answered: “Think, for speech resulteth
<lb/>From thought and brain, and know thou that the death
<lb/>Of one least harmful is the greatest loss
<lb/>Of all, but thou mayst joy when bad men die,
<lb/>Albeit death is common to us all.
<lb/>This then is profit and the other loss:
<lb/>Let wisdom judge the answer of us both.”</p>

<p>The Roman gave assent to what he heard;
<lb/>Those words seemed excellent to him; he smiled,
<lb/>Did reverence to the Shah and said to him :—
<lb/>‘How happy is the country of Iran!
<milestone unit="calced" n="1556"/>
<lb/>For others look not on a king of kings
<lb/>Like thee, or on a high priest such as thine.
<lb/>Thou art the world’s high crown in understanding,
<lb/>In priests thou art the greatest of the great.
<lb/>Wouldst thou from Caesar tribute? Be it so,
<lb/>Because thy minister is sovereign
<lb/>In wisdom,” and his words rejoiced the king,
<lb/>Whose heart grew fresh as roses in the spring.</p>

<pb n="106"/>
<head>§ 25
How Bahram dismissed Caesar’s Envoy and charged his own Officials</head>
<p>
<lb/>The envoy left the presence of the Shah,
<lb/>The night came on, the Sable Banner rose,
<lb/>The men of lore were weary of discourse,
<lb/>The valiant monarch sought his ladies’ bower.
<lb/>The circling vault of heaven rested not,
<lb/>But roused the sleepers from their drowsihead,
<lb/>The fountain of the sun set up its flag,
<lb/>The world-Shah’s head woke lightly from repose,
<lb/>The chamberlain unlocked the audience-door,
<lb/>The king sat down upon the throne of gold.
<lb/>He bade a robe of honour be made ready,
<lb/>The envoy summoned. Indian scimitars
<lb/>With golden scabbards, noble steeds betrapped
<lb/>With gold, dinars, gems, musk, and spicery,
<lb/>Beyond that ancient man’s imaginings,
<lb/>The shrewd Shah gave the envoy, then was busied
<lb/>With his own folk’s affairs. By his command
<lb/>The high priest, who was counsellor withal,
<lb/>Approached him with a noble company,
<lb/>And he apportioned all the land among
<lb/>Those warlike paladins, gave drachms and steeds
<lb/>And signet-rings and casques, and, to the greatest,
<lb/>Thrones, crowns, and provinces. He filled the world
<lb/>With right, and small and great rejoiced in him.
<lb/>He banned the unjust with chilling words, unlargessed,
<lb/>And, after, thus harangued the archimages:—
<lb/>"Ye sages worshipful and pure of heart!
<lb/>The world for us hath many memories
<lb/>Of doings of the Shahs unjust and just,
<lb/>Whose hands oft-times were stretched for ill what while
<lb/>Their persons lurked mid ease and luxury.
<note n="1">Reading with P.</note>
<pb n="107"/>
<lb/>The world was frighted by these evil men,
<lb/>The hearts of all the good were rent in twain;
<lb/>All hands were occupied with evil-doing,
<lb/>And none was instant in the cause of God;
<lb/>The Div’s work everywhere prevailed; hearts ceased
<lb/>To fear the Master of the world. The head
<lb/>Of virtues and the hand of ill, the door
<lb/>Of understanding and the quest of wisdom,
<lb/>Are laid upon the Shah’s neck, and in him
<lb/>Especially are seen both right and wrong.
<lb/>My sire, who stretched his hand out to injustice,
<lb/>Was not a holy man, wise or devout.
<lb/>Hold not his actions strange, for rust attacked
<lb/>The bright steel of his heart. Consider too
<lb/>The experience of Jamshid and Shah Kaus
<lb/>For having sought the guidance of the Div.
<lb/>My father in like manner followed them,
<lb/>And washed not his dark soul in wisdom’s stream.
<lb/>His subjects writhed, and many lost their lives
<lb/>Through his severity. Now he hath gone,
<lb/>Hath left behind him but an evil name,
<lb/>And hath no praise from any, yet let us
<lb/>Give blessings to his soul, for God forbid
<lb/>That it should writhe through our vindictiveness;
<lb/>And now that I am seated on his throne
<lb/>His way will doubtless be to Paradise.
<lb/>I ask the world’s Lord to bestow upon me,
<lb/>Alike in public and in private, strength
<lb/>To treat my subjects with humanity,
<lb/>And make pure musk out of the darksome dust,
<lb/>That when therewith my body shall conjoin
<lb/>None wronged by me may pluck me by the skirt.
<lb/>Put ye too on the robe of uprightness,
<lb/>With hearts washed clean from wrong, for none is born
<lb/>Unless to die, be he of Persian, Arab,
<lb/>Or Roman race; death’s charge is lion-like,
<pb n="108"/>
<lb/>And from its claws none can withdraw the neck;
<lb/>It maketh quarry of the rending lion,
<lb/>The dragon’s body ’scapeth not its toils.
<lb/>Where are the heads and crowns of kings of kings!
<lb/>Where are the mighty and the glorious chiefs?
<lb/>Where are the cavaliers and haughty ones?
<lb/>I see no trace of them within the world.
<lb/>Where are its fair who joyed those chieftains’ souls?
<lb/>Know thou that all whose cheeks are ‘neath the shroud
<lb/>Are wedded to the dust. Let all of us
<lb/>Have hands both clean and good, and not commit
<lb/>The world to evil ways. I swear by God,
<lb/>The Lord of all, who gave to me the Grace,
<lb/>With crown and throne, high birth and quality,
<lb/>That if an officer of mine shall wrong
<lb/>The mean or mighty by a pinch of dust
<lb/>I will consume his body in the fire,
<lb/>Or hang him to a gibbet by the neck.
<lb/>If in the watches of the night a thief
<lb/>Shall steal a poor man’s quilt I will make good
<lb/>His loss from mine own treasury with brocade,
<lb/>And wash the hearts of mourners from their woe;
<lb/>While if a sheep be taken from the flock
<lb/>In dark night or in snow-storm I will give
<lb/>Instead thereof a steed of noble race,
<lb/>And God forbid that I should ask for thanks.
<lb/>If in a war against mine enemies
<lb/>A cavalier is wounded in the fight
<lb/>I will assign him yearly maintenance,
<lb/>I will not leave his children in distress.
<lb/>Praise ye the Judge that knoweth what is good
<lb/>Throughout eternity. Let none lay hand
<lb/>On water or on fire except the priests
<lb/>That are fire-worshippers. Slay not draught-oxen,
<lb/>For they are of avail in husbandry,
<lb/>Unless past work and worthless to their owner.
<pb n="109"/>
<lb/>Pack-oxen too must not be slain, the land
<lb/>Else will grow void of grace. Deliberate
<lb/>In all things with the men of lore and break not
<lb/>The hearts of children that are fatherless.
<lb/>Be alien from the promptings of the Div,
<lb/>In fight ensue not feast. If I require
<lb/>My subjects to pay taxes I abjure
<lb/>God, throne, and crown. Since Yazdagird, my father,
<lb/>Did evil, to redress that wrong have I
<lb/>Disseminated justice. Let your hearts
<lb/>All joy to do it and in gratitude
<lb/>Observe the Cult of Fire. God may forgive him,
<lb/>And guide him out of Hell to Paradise.
<lb/>Give pleasure to the young, break not the hearts
<lb/>Of lieges, keep from drunkenness in age,
<lb/>For ’tis unseemly in the old to tope;
<lb/>Sin ye not therefore, for in age ’tis well
<lb/>To make your preparations to depart.
<lb/>If God, the righteous Judge, approveth us
<lb/>Let not the future trouble you to-day;
<lb/>Let there be pleasure in my subjects’ hearts,
<lb/>And let the nobles’ heads be free from grief.”
<lb/>The chiefs, on hearing and considering well
<lb/>His words, all wept that such an one was theirs,
<lb/>A Shah so wise and shrewd, acclaimed his worth,
<lb/>And hailed him as the great king of the earth.</p>


<head>§ 26
How Bahram went with his own Letter to Shangul, King of Hind</head>
<p>
<lb/>A wise wazir rose to his feet and said:—
<lb/>"O judge of what is just and right! the world
<lb/>Hath ceased to fear malignants, toil and stress
<lb/>Have left our coasts. Howbeit famed Shangul
<pb n="110"/>
<lb/>Among the folk of Hind is still perverse;
<lb/>His bands of plunderers infest the earth
<lb/>From Hindustan up to the coasts of Chin.
<lb/>He will lay hands for ill upon Iran,
<lb/>And thou shouldst apprehend this. Thou art Shah;
<lb/>Shangul but wardeth Hind, so why should he
<lb/>Take toll of Sind and Chin? Consider this,
<lb/>And note his plans, for ill must not ensue."
<lb/>The Shah, on hearing this, was full of thought,
<lb/>The world before him seemed a tangled brake,
<lb/>And thus he answered: "I will deal herewith
<lb/>In secret, not consulting any one.
<lb/>I will myself alone observe his troops,
<lb/>The conduct of his kingship and his throne,
<lb/>Approaching him as an ambassador,
<lb/>And not acquaint the Iranians and the lords.
<lb/>O holy archimage! write to Shangul
<lb/>A firm but courteous letter."
</p>

<p>Thereupon
<lb/>His pious minister went with a scribe,
<lb/>And others that were indispensable,
<lb/>And canvassed all the case, brought paper, ink,
<lb/>And pen, and wrote a letter full of counsel,
<lb/>Instruction, knowledge, and the praise of God.
<lb/>It thus began: "From God be praise on those
<lb/>That seek His praise who is the Lord of all
<lb/>That is and is not. All things have their peers,
<lb/>But God is One. Of all that He bestoweth
<lb/>Upon His slaves, on sovereign and subject,
<lb/>Naught is more great than wisdom which illumeth
<lb/>Both. He whom wisdom gladdeneth will walk not
<lb/>The world for ill, and he that chooseth right
<lb/>Ne'er will repent thereof; he cannot savour
<lb/>Ill from the stream of knowledge. Wisdom looseth
<lb/>Man from mishap; may none be wrung therewith.
<lb/>Wisdom’s first token is that one should dread
<pb n="111"/>
<lb/>Ill-doing all one’s years and know oneself;
<lb/>Then must he search the world with wisdom’s eye,
<lb/>For wisdom is the diadem of kings,
<lb/>And jewel of the men of name withal.
<lb/>Thou know'st not thine own measure but dost plunge
<lb/>Thy soul in blood. Now, seeing that I am
<lb/>The monarch of the age, both good and ill
<lb/>Are laid to me. Do thou so reign that right
<lb/>May be preserved, for ill is manifest
<lb/>On all sides. 'Tis not kingly to make raids,
<lb/>And cotton with the ill-disposed. Thy grandsire
<lb/>Was vassal to us and thy sire a slave
<lb/>Before our Shahs, and none of us allowed
<lb/>Arrears in tribute out of Hindustan.
<lb/>Now mark the fortune of the Khan of Chin,
<lb/>Who came thence 'gainst Iran. He gave to spoil
<lb/>All that he brought, and writhed for his ill deeds.
<lb/>I see thee also thus disposed, the same
<lb/>Perversity, same Glory, and same Faith.
<lb/>Now I have arms and treasures for the war,
<lb/>My soldiers are devoted and arrayed;
<lb/>Thou canst not stand against my gallant men,
<lb/>And there is not a general in Hind.
<lb/>Thou art conceited of thy might, preferring
<lb/>Thine own rill to the river. Now behold!
<lb/>I have dispatched an envoy to thee, one
<lb/>Of knowledge, eloquence, and high degree.
<lb/>Send tribute or make war and fortify
<lb/>The passes. Be our blessing on his soul
<lb/>Whose warp and woof are equity and wisdom."
</p>

<p>Whenas air’s breath had made the writing dry
<lb/>The writer of the letter folded it,
<lb/>And then the scribe addressed it on this wise:—
<lb/>'From this world’s king, the monarch shrewd of wit,
<lb/>The lord of government, the lord of might,
<lb/>The world’s possessor, generous Bahram Gir,
<pb n="112"/>
<lb/>Who on the day of Ard in month Khurdad
<lb/>Received from Yazdagird the royal crown,
<lb/>Chief of the marches, guardian of the realm,
<lb/>To whom Saklab and Rum are tributary,
<lb/>This to Shangul, who ruleth over Hind
<lb/>From Sind up to the river of Kannuj.'
<note n="1">The Ganges is meant.</note>
<lb/>The monarch sealed the letter with his signet,
<lb/>And then made ready for the chase, but none
<lb/>Of all the host knew of his purposes
<lb/>Except the nobles of his company.
<lb/>Thus he drew nigh to Hindustan and crossed
<lb/>The river of magician-land.
<note n="2">Hindustan. Cf. Vol. i. p. 163.</note> On nearing
<lb/>The palace of Shangul he gazed upon
<lb/>The hall of audience with its gate and curtain.
<lb/>It rose aloft in air, and at the gate
<lb/>There was no lack of arms and equipage,
<lb/>For there stood cavaliers and elephants
<lb/>Amid a din of gongs and Indian bells.
<lb/>He stood there all amazed and lost in thought,
<lb/>Then on this wise addressed the curtain-keepers,
<lb/>The servants and officials of the gate:—
<lb/>"An envoy to this court am I, deputed
<lb/>By conquering Shah Bahram."
</p>

<p>The chamberlain
<lb/>Went to the royal presence from the curtain.
<lb/>They raised it by the king’s command and brought
<lb/>The envoy in with all respect. Bahram Gir
<lb/>Advanced with stately step, and saw a chamber
<lb/>With crystal roof. On drawing near Shangul
<lb/>Bahram beheld him seated on his throne
<lb/>Of majesty, and crowned. The steps that led
<lb/>Up to that golden throne were all of crystal.
<lb/>There sat the king in all his Grace and might,
<pb n="113"/>
<lb/>Arrayed in silver broidered with gold thread
<lb/>Beset with many a gem. Bahram beheld
<lb/>The monarch’s brother on an ante-throne,
<lb/>And wearing on his head a jewelled crown.
<lb/>The minister sat by; the monarch’s son
<lb/>Stood there before the throne. The Shah drew nigh
<lb/>Thereto, did reverence, and paused awhile,
<lb/>Then quickly loosed his tongue. "I have," he said,
<lb/>"A letter written in our tongue on silk,
<lb/>Sent to the king of Hind by Shah Bahram—
<lb/>The world’s lord who possesseth crown and throne."
<lb/>The king, on hearing what Bahram said, bade
<lb/>To bring a golden ante-throne. They set him
<lb/>Upon that seat of gold, and from the gate
<lb/>Called in his comrades. Seated thus he said:—
<lb/>"Exalted king! I will unloose my lips
<lb/>When thou commandest. May both good and greatness
<lb/>Be ever thine."
</p>

<p>Shangul replied: "Proceed,
<lb/>For heaven’s blessing is on those who speak."
<lb/>Bahram rejoined: "That Shah of royal race,
<lb/>Whose like no mother in the world hath borne,
<lb/>The exalted prince, the glory of the state,
<lb/>Whose justice turneth bane to antidote,
<lb/>To whom all potentates are tributary,
<lb/>Whose prey is lions in the chase, and who,
<lb/>On taking up the scimitar in fight,
<lb/>Converteth deserts into seas of blood,
<lb/>In generosity like clouds in spring,
<lb/>In whose sight treasures and dinars are vile,
<lb/>Hath sent the king of Hind an embassy,
<lb/>And letter writ on silk in Pahlavi."
</p>

<head>§ 27
How Shangul received the Letter from Bahram and made Reply</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king, on hearing this, asked for the letter,
<lb/>And marvelled at that chief. A noble scribe
<lb/>Read it, whereat the monarch’s face became
<lb/>Like gall. He said: “O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Haste not to speak, and act not haughtily.
<lb/>Thy Shah displayeth his imperiousness,
<lb/>Witness thy journey hither. Should one ask
<lb/>For tribute out of Hindustan the wise
<lb/>Would disavow him. If thy master speaketh
<lb/>Of host and treasure, and of giving land
<lb/>And cities up to woe... well, other kings
<lb/>Are cranes, I am an eagle; they are dust,
<lb/>I am a sea. None fighteth with the stars,
<lb/>Or seeketh fame by warring with the sky.
<lb/>Worth is much better than the useless talk
<lb/>That maketh wise men hold thee in contempt.
<lb/>Ye have not manhood, knowledge, realm or city;
<lb/>Your share of sovereignty is only loss.
<lb/>My whole land is a hidden treasury
<lb/>Whereon mine ancestors have laid no hand,
<lb/>Beside my store of mail for man and steed,
<lb/>Which, if my treasurer should bring it forth,
<lb/>Would ask for elephants to bear the keys,
<lb/>If mighty elephants could carry them;
<lb/>And should I count my swords and coats of mail
<lb/>The stars would seem contemptible in sum
<lb/>To thee. The earth will not sustain my host,
<lb/>My throne, and mighty elephants. If thou
<lb/>Shouldst multiply a thousand thousand-fold
<lb/>'Twould be the sum of those that call me king.
<lb/>Mine are the jewels of the hills and seas,
<lb/>I am the present mainstay of the world.
<pb n="115"/>
<lb/>The founts of aloe, musk, and ambergris,
<lb/>The hoards of undried camphor and the drugs
<lb/>That cure the suffering, whoever shall ail
<lb/>Throughout the world, are plenteous in my realm,
<lb/>As well as silver, gold, and jewelry,
<lb/>While fourscore kings with crowns of gold up-gird
<lb/>Their loins at my behest. My land is full
<lb/>Of mountain, stream, and chasm; not e’en a div
<lb/>Would find his way across it. From Kannauj
<lb/>Up to the marches of Iran and thence
<lb/>Right to Saklab and Chin the chiefs are all
<lb/>My men and cannot choose but homage me.
<lb/>The watchmen of Khutan, of Hind, and Chin
<lb/>Use in their challenges no name but mine;
<lb/>All speak the praises of my crown and grow
<lb/>More serviceable. In my women’s bower
<lb/>The daughter of Faghfur of Chin invoketh
<lb/>God’s blessing on me—me of all the world.
<lb/>By her I have a lion-hearted son,
<lb/>Whose scimitar despoileth mountains’ hearts.
<lb/>No one since Kai Kaous and Kai Kobad
<lb/>E’er hath concerned himself about this land.
<lb/>Three hundred thousand warlike troops withal
<lb/>Acclaim me. Of allies I have twelve hundred,
<lb/>Who all are wholly in my confidence;
<lb/>All are my kith and kin by long descent,
<lb/>And stand before me here in Hind. Their war-cry
<lb/>Would make the lions of the jungle gnaw
<lb/>Their claws. If there were any precedent
<lb/>For chiefs to slay an envoy out of wrath
<lb/>Thy head and body would I part, and let
<lb/>Thy raiment wail for thee."
</p>

<p>Bahram replied:—
<lb/>"As thou art great, O king! sow not the seed
<lb/>Of wrath. My Shah said: ‘Say to him: "If thou
<lb/>Art wise choose not the pathway of perverseness."’
<lb/>Produce now from thy court two men of lore,
<lb/>Of fluent tongue, and happy in discourse,
<lb/>And if in rede and wisdom they excel
<lb/>One of these men with me then I have done
<lb/>With this thy land, for wise men spurn not words;
<lb/>Or else choose out among the warriors
<lb/>That wield in Hindustan the massive mace
<lb/>A hundred horsemen to fight one of us,
<lb/>And we, what time thy wit and worth shall stand
<lb/>Revealed, will ask not tribute from thy land."
</p>
<head>§ 27 How Shangul received the Letter from Bahram and made Reply</head>
<p>
<lb/>The king, on hearing this, asked for the letter,
<lb/>And marvelled at that chief. A noble scribe
<lb/>Read it, whereat the monarch’s face became
<lb/>Like gall. He said: “O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Haste not to speak, and act not haughtily.
<lb/>Thy Shah displayeth his imperiousness,
<lb/>Witness thy journey hither. Should one ask
<lb/>For tribute out of Hindustan the wise
<lb/>Would disavow him. If thy master speaketh
<lb/>Of host and treasure, and of giving land
<lb/>And cities up to woe... well, other kings
<lb/>Are cranes, I am an eagle; they are dust,
<lb/>I am a sea. None fighteth with the stars,
<lb/>Or seeketh fame by warring with the sky.
<lb/>Worth is much better than the useless talk
<lb/>That maketh wise men hold thee in contempt.
<lb/>Ye have not manhood, knowledge, realm or city;
<lb/>Your share of sovereignty is only loss.
<lb/>My whole land is a hidden treasury
<lb/>Whereon mine ancestors have laid no hand,
<lb/>Beside my store of mail for man and steed,
<lb/>Which, if my treasurer should bring it forth,
<lb/>Would ask for elephants to bear the keys,
<lb/>If mighty elephants could carry them;

<head>§ 28
How Shangul prepared a Feast for Bahram, and how
Bahram displayed his Prowess</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul, on hearing this, said to Bahram:—
<lb/>‘Thy counsel sorteth not with manliness.
<lb/>Abide a season and relax thyself,
<lb/>Why parley to no purpose?”’
<lb/>They made ready
<lb/>A splendid hall. Bahram reposed till noon,
<lb/>And when the Crown that lighteneth the world
<lb/>Had reached its height the feast was all prepared
<lb/>According to the bidding of the king,
<lb/>And zealous servants were about the hall.
<lb/>When they had spread the board before Shangul
<lb/>He bade a servant: “Summon to the feast
<lb/>The envoy of the Iranian king, the man
<lb/>Of fluent utterance and novel aims.
<lb/>Bring his companions too and seat them where
<lb/>Ambassadors are placed.”’
<lb/>Bahram came quickly,
<lb/>Sat at the board and oped his hand to bread,
<lb/>But shut his lips to speech. The eating done,
<pb n="117"/>
<lb/>They set themselves to quaff and called for harpists
<lb/>And wine. The scent of musk rose from the feast,
<lb/>The hall was spread with golden carpetings.
<lb/>Now when the lords were merry in their cups,
<lb/>And recked not of the future, king Shangul
<lb/>Bade two strong men attend, men fit to wrestle
<lb/>Against the Div. These noble athletes came,
<lb/>And girt their loincloths round them. Those two youths
<lb/>Contended lustily and strained and writhed
<lb/>Together. Now Bahram took up a cup
<lb/>Of crystal and the wine confused his brain.
<lb/>He spake thus to Shangul: “O king, bid me
<lb/>To gird me for a bout, for when I wrestle
<lb/>Against the strong I am away from harm
<lb/>And drunkenness.”’
<lb/>Shangul said smiling: “Rise,
<lb/>And, if thou shalt overcome them, shed their blood.”’
<lb/>Bahram, on hearing this, rose to his feet,
<lb/>And boldly bending down the upright form
<lb/>Of him whose waist he clutched (a lion so
<lb/>Might seize upon wild onager) he flung
<lb/>His foeman down so that his bones were broken,
<lb/>And all the colour left his cheeks. Shangul
<lb/>Was in amazement at the victor’s mien,
<lb/>His stature and his shoulders and his strength,
<lb/>Invoked God in the Indian tongue and deemed
<lb/>Bahram to be a match for forty men.
<lb/>When they were all bemused with pleasant wine
<lb/>They left the hall of jewelled tracery
<lb/>And, when the vault of heaven donned musk-hued silk,
<lb/>Both young and old slept after banqueting.
<lb/>Shangul went to his sleeping-place, the wine
<lb/>Had turned his looks and thoughts from king Bahram.
<lb/>Now when the musky-scented Veil was changed
<lb/>To gold, and in the sky the sun appeared,
<pb n="118"/>
<lb/>The king of Indians mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And went forth to the Ground with polo-stick
<lb/>In hand. His servants bore his bow and arrows,
<lb/>And for a while he rode to please himself,
<lb/>Then ordered Shah Bahram to mount and take
<lb/>His royal bow in hand. Bahram replied:—
<lb/>‘I have a number of Iranian horsemen
<lb/>With me, O king! and they are fain to ply
<lb/>The arrow and the polo-stick when bidden
<lb/>By the most noble king.”
</p>

<p>Shangul replied:—
<lb/>‘The arrows and the bow are doubtlessly
<lb/>The mainstays of the cavalier. Do thou,
<lb/>Who hast such limbs and neck and might of hand,
<lb/>String up thy bow and shoot.”
</p>

<p>Bahram Gur strung
<lb/>His bow and urged his steed with shouts. He took
<lb/>And shot an arrow that destroyed the mark.
<lb/>The sportsmen and the warriors ’gan to call
<lb/>Their blessings down upon him, one and all.
</p>

<head>§ 29
How Shangul suspected Bahram and kept him from Iran</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul, misdoubting of Bahram, thought thus:—
<lb/>“This stature, Grace, and skill in archery
<lb/>Resemble not a mere ambassador’s
<lb/>Of Hindustan, of Turkistan, or Persia,
<lb/>But, be he of the Shah’s race or a noble,
<lb/>‘Twere well I call him brother,” smiled and said
<lb/>Thus to Bahram: “Famed, high-born prince! thou art
<lb/>No doubt the Shah’s own brother, being dowered
<lb/>With vigour, strength, and skill in archery,
<lb/>Because the Grace of kings, the might of lions,
<lb/>Are thine. Art thou then but a gallant chief?”
</p>

<p>Bahram said: “King of Hind! discredit not
<lb/>Ambassadors. I am not of the seed
<lb/>Of Yazdagird or Shah. To call him brother
<lb/>Would be a crime in me. A stranger I,
<lb/>Come from Iran, no seeker after knowledge,
<lb/>No sage. Dismiss me for the way is long,
<lb/>And I must not incur the Shah’s displeasure.”
</p>

<p>Shangul replied: “Be not importunate,
<lb/>For I have somewhat still to say to thee.
<lb/>Thou must not be so eager to depart,
<lb/>For hasty going prospereth not. Abide
<lb/>With us and set thy heart at ease. If thou
<lb/>Wilt have not mellowed wine then take it crude.”
<note n="1">Couplet omitted.</note>
<lb/>He said thereafter to his own adept:—
<lb/>“I have a secret for thee. If this man
<lb/>Be not sib to Bahram, or in degree
<lb/>Above his paladins, 'twill prove a marvel
<lb/>To wise men’s hearts. We must not trust his words.
<lb/>Address him courteously and say: ‘Abide;
<lb/>There is no cause for thee to leave Kannauj.’
<lb/>Sayst thou: ‘He will detect deceit herein?’
<lb/>If words of mine may terrify his heart
<lb/>It will be better far for thee to speak,
<lb/>And talk to him in convenable terms.
<lb/>Say thus to him: ‘Tis well for thee to gain
<lb/>More estimation with the king of Hind.
<lb/>Now if thou will abide with him, and further
<lb/>His subtle policy, thou shalt possess
<lb/>The goodliest march of Hind because the king
<lb/>Hath thee in high esteem. ’Twill be a land
<lb/>Of never-ending springtide where the streams
<lb/>Breathe of the rose. The fortunate ne’er quit
<lb/>Kannauj where twice a year the fruit-trees bear,
</p>

<p>Where there are treasures, gems, dinars, and drachms,
<lb/>And where drachms can be had hearts are not sad.
<lb/>The king is gracious and for love of thee
<lb/>He smileth when he looketh on thy face.’
<lb/>What time ye meet speak thou whate’er thou knowest
<lb/>To this effect and then inquire his name,
<lb/>For that will joy my heart. Should our land please him
<lb/>Our favours would surpass his excellence,
<lb/>We would appoint him captain of the host
<lb/>Anon, in favour highest in the land.”
</p>

<p>The king’s experienced minister departed,
<lb/>Informed Bahram, and pointed him his way,
<lb/>Then asked his name because without his name
<lb/>No answer would suffice. Bahram changed colour,
<lb/>On hearing this, perplexed for his reply.
<lb/>At length he said: “O man of eloquence!
<lb/>Make me not wan of visage in two realms.
<lb/>I will quit not the Shah for any treasure
<lb/>However much I may be pinched by want.
<lb/>The teachings of our Faith are otherwise,
<lb/>As are our estimations, wonts, and ways,
<lb/>And every one that turneth from his king
<lb/>Is lost by such revolt. No man of wisdom
<lb/>Is eager for addition; bad and good
<lb/>Are transient with us. Where is Faridun,
<lb/>The master of the crown, he that restored
<lb/>The age? Where are those chiefs of royal race,
<lb/>The world-lords Kai Khusrau and Kai Kobad?
<lb/>Thou hast withal some knowledge of Bahram,
<lb/>The young, ambitious, and imperious,
<lb/>Who, if I cross his purpose, will avail
<lb/>To bring the world in ruins on my head,
<lb/>Leave Hindustan not field or fell but bear
<lb/>Off to Iran the dust of Wizard-land.
<note n="2">Cf. p. 112 and note.</note>
<lb/>My better plan is to return to court,
<lb/>And to the purview of the conquering Shah.
<lb/>If thou wouldst have my name it is Barzu;
<lb/>My monarch and my parents call me so.
<lb/>Communicate mine answer to Shangul,
<lb/>For I have stayed long in an alien realm.”
</p>

<p>The minister, on hearing this reply,
<lb/>Told all that he had heard before the king,
<lb/>Who frowned and said: “He holdeth him aloof,
<lb/>But I will take such order that this Light
<lb/>Of hosts shall end his days.”
</p>

<p>There was a wolf
<note n="3">Perhaps for “gurg,” wolf, we ought to read "karg,” rhinoceros.
The word is spelt both with g and k in C. and is made to rhyme with
“aarg,” death, and “tagarg,” hail. Cf. NIN, p. 55, note.</note>
<lb/>Within the monarch’s coasts of bulk so vast
<lb/>That it withstood the wind. The lions fled
<lb/>The woods before it, and the swift-winged vultures
<lb/>The sky. Thereat all Hind was full of fear:
<lb/>Its howlings deafened those most keen of ear.
</p>

<head>§ 30
How Bahram fought with the Wolf at the Bidding of
Shangul and slew it</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul said to Bahram: “O man approved!
<lb/>All enterprises prosper in thy hands.
<lb/>A wood near by my city troubleth me.
<lb/>There is a wolf there like a crocodile,
<lb/>And rendeth lions’ hearts and leopards’ hides.
<lb/>Let it be thine to go against this wolf,
<lb/>And pierce its hide all over with thine arrows.
<lb/>The world may find rest then and by thy Grace,
<lb/>Victorious one! Thenceforth in mine esteem,
<lb/>And that of all this noble company,
<pb n="122"/>
<lb/>Thy station shall be such that evermore
<lb/>The folk of Hind and Chin all shall acclaim thee.”
<lb/>Bahram, the honest, said: “I need a guide;
<lb/>Then by God’s strength, when I behold the beast,
<lb/>Thou shalt perceive its garment soaked in blood.”
<note n="1">Garment for skin as in Job ali. 13.</note>
<lb/>Shangul provided him a guide that knew
<lb/>The creature’s lair and haunt, and then Bahram
<lb/>Went with his trusty guide toward the wood
<lb/>Of that blood-shedding wolf. Much spake the guide
<lb/>About its lair, its height and breadth and bulk,
<lb/>Showed where it was and went back while Bahram
<lb/>Approached apace. Iranians thronged behind him
<lb/>With loins girt for the fray, but when they saw
<lb/>Afar so vast a wood, the monster’s bulk,
<lb/>And lair that it had made, all said: “O Shah!
<lb/>Adventure not; thou wilt surpass the bounds
<lb/>Of hardihood because, however brave
<lb/>Thou art in fight, none hath fought rocks and mountains.
<lb/>Say to Shangul: ‘This may not be. I have
<lb/>No sanction for this combat from the Shah.
<lb/>I fight when I am bidden so that he,
<lb/>On hearing of it, may advance my rank.’”
<lb/>Bahram replied: “If holy God hath given
<lb/>My dust to Hindustan how can I die
<lb/>Elsewhere? That is beyond me.”
</p>

<p>That brave youth
<lb/>Strung up his bow, and thou hadst said: “He holdeth
<lb/>His own life cheap!”
<lb/>He sped toward the wolf
<lb/>With head all rage and heart resigned to death.
<lb/>He grasped his royal bow and, having drawn
<lb/>Some poplar arrows from his quiver, poured
<lb/>His shafts like hail till by that token anguish
<lb/>O’ercame the wolf. On seeing the beast’s end nigh,
<pb n="123"/>
<lb/>Bahram, exchanging bow for sword, smote off
<lb/>Its head, exclaiming: “In the name of God,
<lb/>Who hath not mate or peer and gave to me
<lb/>Such Grace and might! By His command the sun
<lb/>Is bright in heaven.”
<lb/>He bade bring wain and oxen
<lb/>To carry that wolf’s carcase from the wood.
<lb/>They bore it. When Shangul saw it afar
<lb/>He had his banquet-hall decked with brocade,
<lb/>And when the mighty king sat on his throne
<lb/>He set Bahram upon the seat of honour
<lb/>While all the chiefs of Hind, and cavaliers
<lb/>Of Chin, applauded him. The lords all came
<lb/>With offerings and spake thus to Bahram:—
<lb/>"None ever did a deed to equal thine;
<lb/>Its brilliancy is more than eyes can bear.”
</p>

<p>As for Shangul he was both glad and grieved,
<lb/>Appearing cheerful and depressed by turns.
<lb/>There was a dragon, an amphibious beast,
<lb/>Which haunted streams and sunned itself ashore;
<lb/>It, with its breath, could suck huge elephants
<lb/>Down, and raise waves upon the dark blue sea.
<lb/>Shangul spake thus to his companions,
<lb/>His clever confidants: “By turns this envoy,
<lb/>This lion-man, doth please and trouble me.
<lb/>If he remained he would be my support,
<lb/>The ruler of Kannauj and of my realm,
<lb/>But if he goeth from me to Iran
<lb/>Bahram will devastate Kannauj; with such
<lb/>A servitor to such a lord this land
<lb/>Will lose both hue and odour. All the night
<lb/>Have I been musing o’er his case and framing
<lb/>A fresh device—to send him to that dragon,
<lb/>Which surely he will 'scape not. Then shall I
<pb n="124"/>
<lb/>Be censured not on his account if he
<lb/>Will fight with dragons.”
<lb/>So he called Bahram,
<lb/>Told stories of the mighty men, and said:—
<lb/>“God, Author of the soul, hath led thee hither
<lb/>Out of the country of Iran to purge
<lb/>The ills of Hindustan as is the way
<lb/>Of men of name. A matter fraught with pain
<lb/>And travail is confronting us, of travail
<lb/>At first but treasure in the end. If thou
<lb/>Accomplish this depart on thy return
<lb/>With my good wishes home.”
</p>

<p>The Shah replied:—
<lb/>“I may not leave the way of thy behests,
<lb/>But will perform thy bidding faithfully
<lb/>Unless the heaven itself shall turn awry.”
</p>

<head>§ 31
How Bahram slew a Dragon</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul said to Bahram: 'Within my realm
<lb/>There is a dragon—an exceeding bale—
<lb/>Which fareth both by land and stream to hunt
<lb/>The lashing crocodile. Thou mayst devise
<lb/>A scheme to rid thereof the realm of Hind,
<lb/>Whose tribute thou shalt carry to Iran,
<lb/>For all the country will assent thereto,
<lb/>And likewise gifts therefrom of aloe-wood,
<lb/>Of swords, and goods of all kinds, with the tribute."
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: "Great king and sovereign,
<lb/>Whose word is law in Hind! by God, the Just
<lb/>And Holy One's, command I will cut off
<lb/>The footing of the dragon from the earth,
<lb/>But must be shown its lair whereof I know not."
<pb n="125"/>
<lb/>Shangul accordingly dispatched a guide
<lb/>To show it to Bahram who went his way
<lb/>With thirty horsemen, nobles of Iran
<lb/>And swordsmen. Hasting to the stream he saw
<lb/>The dragon mid the gloom, its form, its writhing,
<lb/>And furiousness, fire flashing from its eyes.
<lb/>The nobles of Iran with loud exclaims,
<lb/>And shrewdly troubled at that dragon, said:—
<lb/>"Hold not this dragon as thou didst the wolf,
<lb/>O king! the other day. By one mishap
<lb/>Give not Iran up to the wind, rejoice not
<lb/>Thy foemen here."
</p>

<p>The bold Bahram replied:—
<lb/>"'T must entrust my life to all-just God.
<lb/>If I am doomed to perish by this dragon
<lb/>My time will be not lengthened or decreased
<lb/>By hardihood."
<lb/>He strung his bow, he chose
<lb/>Shafts dipped in bane of milk, and 'gan to shower them
<lb/>Down on the dragon, wheeling all the while,
<lb/>Like horsemen in the fray, to left and right.
<lb/>He sewed up with steel points the dragon's mouth,
<lb/>Whose venom scorched the brambles, then he shot
<lb/>Four arrows at its head, and blood and poison
<lb/>Poured down its breast. The dragon's body failed
<lb/>By reason of those shafts, and all the ground
<lb/>Ran with its gore and bane. Then lightly drew
<lb/>Bahram his sword of watered steel and pierced
<lb/>The dragon’s heart right dourly, hacked its neck
<lb/>With sword and battle-ax, and flung to earth
<lb/>Its lifeless form. The dragon overthrown,
<lb/>He turned in duty to the Lord and said:—
<lb/>"O Judge who judgest righteously! 'tis Thou
<lb/>That slewest this great dragon, for who else
<pb n="126"/>
<lb/>Hath might enough? Thou art Thy servants’ refuge
<lb/>From every ill."
</p>

<p>He sought the king of Hind,
<lb/>The noble chieftain of the Sindian host,
<lb/>And said: "The king is freed from these attacks
<lb/>By His decree—the Judge and Nourisher's."
</p>

<p>Shangul grieved, hearing this, because Bahram
<lb/>Was in the saddle still. He bade that wains
<lb/>And oxen should convey the dragon's carcase
<lb/>To plain from forest, while all Hindustan
<lb/>Invoked upon Iran the All-Just's blessing:—
<lb/>"For there a cavalier like this was born
<lb/>To fight with dragons. One who hath such limbs,
<lb/>Such stature and such bearing cannot be
<lb/>But equal to the king in his degree."
</p>


<head>§ 32
How Shangul became troubled about Bahram and
gave a Daughter to him</head>
<p>
<lb/>All men rejoiced except Shangul whose heart
<lb/>Was pained, the matter made his visage wan,
<lb/>And when night came he summoned his wise men,
<lb/>Both those of his own kin and aliens,
<lb/>And thus he said: “This man of Shah Bahram’s,
<lb/>Who hath such might, such limbs, and mastery,
<lb/>Do what I may, is worsted by no toil!
<lb/>Now if he goeth from us to Iran,
<lb/>And cometh to the monarch of the brave,
<lb/>He will depreciate my host and say
<lb/>That here in Hindustan there is no horseman,
<lb/>And so my foemen may grow insolent.
<lb/>I will behead the envoy, will destroy him
<lb/>By stealth. What say ye? What do ye advise?”
<pb n="127"/>
<lb/>"Bring not thy heart, O king!” the wise men
answered,
<lb/>"To sorrow by such deeds. For thee to slay
<lb/>The ambassadors of kings would be an act
<lb/>Unwise and senseless. No one e’er conceived
<lb/>A thought on this wise. Compass no such plan.
<lb/>Thou wilt be execrated by the chiefs,
<lb/>And people should respect their sovereign.
<lb/>By putting this man’s head within the shears
<lb/>Thou wilt bring longsome trouble on thy land.
<lb/>Forthwith will come an army from Iran,
<lb/>And with a potentate like Shah Bahram;
<lb/>None of us in these regions will survive,
<lb/>And thou wilt have to wash thy hands of kingship.
<lb/>This man is our deliverer from the dragon,
<lb/>And slaying should compensate not his toils;
<lb/>Here hath he killed the dragon and the wolf;
<lb/>Give him more life, not death.”
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Shangul grew gloomy, for the sages’ words
<lb/>Perturbed him. Passing thus the night, at dawn
<lb/>He sent a messenger to Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And, when they were together privily
<lb/>Without a minister or counsellor,
<lb/>Said: “O thou Joy of hearts! thou hast prevailed.
<lb/>Attempt no greater feat. I will bestow
<lb/>My daughter on thee as thy wife, for thus
<lb/>Shall I be profited in word and deed.
<lb/>This done, abide with me, for thou wilt have
<lb/>No colour to depart. I will appoint thee
<lb/>The captain of the host and give thee kingship
<lb/>In Hindustan.”
<lb/>Bahram was in amaze,
<lb/>And mused upon his throne, his birth, and glory.
<lb/>"There is no remedy for one’s own acts,”
</p>

<p>He thought, “and this thing cannot bring reproach;
<lb/>Besides by this I may preserve my life,
<lb/>And look again upon Iranian soil,
<lb/>For, as the case is, we have tarried long;
<lb/>The lion is taken in the fox’s net!”
<lb/>Thus said he to Shangul: “I will obey
<lb/>Thy hest and make thy word my rule of life.
<lb/>However of thy daughters choose me one,
<lb/>Who, when I see her, may obtain my praise.”
<lb/>The king of Hind, on hearing this, rejoiced,
<lb/>And decked his halls with painted silk of Chin.
<lb/>Shangul’s three daughters came like jocund spring
<lb/>In all their bravery, their scents, their colours,
<lb/>And looks, and then he bade Bahram Gir: “Go,
<lb/>Prepare thy heart to see a novel sight.”
<lb/>Bahram Gir went immediately, beheld
<lb/>The hall, and of those moon-faced maids chose one
<lb/>Like jocund springtide, Sapinud by name,
<lb/>All grace and modesty, all wit and charm;
<lb/>On him Shangul bestowed her—one that seemed
<lb/>A straight-stemmed cypress and a smokeless lamp—
<lb/>Then chose the richest of his treasuries,
<lb/>Gave to the moon-faced maid the key thereof,
<lb/>Called for Bahram’s companions, cavaliers
<lb/>Of noble rank and masterful, and gave them
<lb/>Dinars and drachms and every kind of wealth,
<lb/>With camphor, aloe-wood, and ambergris,
<lb/>Steeds, golden trappings, girdles, and for those
<lb/>Of highest rank, gold crowns, while for Bahram
<lb/>He had a turquoise crown and glorious throne
<lb/>Of ivory prepared, and decked his palace
<lb/>Of jewelled tracery. All men of name
<lb/>Within Kannauj resorted to that place
<lb/>Of feasting, waiting on their king with joy.
<lb/>They spent a se’nnight thus with wine in hand,
<lb/>All glad and jocund in the banquet-hall,
<lb/>With Sapinud beside Bahram, the king,
<lb/>Like wine in crystal goblet glittering.

How Faghfur of Chin wrote to Bahram and how he replied</head>
<p>
<lb/>Intelligence came to Faghfur of Chin:—
<lb/>"A man of Grace and courage from Iran
<lb/>Hath reached Shangul as an ambassador,
<lb/>And verily is of heroic race.
<lb/>Great exploits have been wrought in Hind by
<lb/>The hand too of this valiant lion-man
<lb/>Through resolution and the might of fortune.
<lb/>Naught but the crown and throne befitteth him,
<lb/>And on him hath Shangul bestowed a daughter,
<lb/>So that his diadem might reach the moon."
</p>

<p>That mighty world-lord wrote to Shah Bahram
<lb/>A letter superscribed: "From him that is
<lb/>The monarch of the world, the head of nobles,
<lb/>And crown of chiefs, to that ambassador
<lb/>Of Persia who with thirty comrades reached
<lb/>Kannuj," and then proceeded: "I have had
<lb/>Accounts of thee, thou famed and glorious man!
<lb/>About thy wisdom, prudence, and advice,
<lb/>And how thou standest steadfast everywhere,
<lb/>So that the wolf and that notorious dragon
<lb/>Could 'scape not from thy shafts and scimitar.
<lb/>The lady given to thee is my kin,
<lb/>Her dust is worth the whole of Hindustan,
<lb/>And thou hast raised thy head on high by thus
<lb/>Affining with this mighty potentate,
<lb/>While in Iran 'twill magnify the Shah,
<lb/>Whose crown well may bediadem the moon,
<lb/>Because his envoy took fit comrades, reached
<lb/>Kannauj, and clasped a Moon upon his breast.
<lb/>Now bear the toil, come hither, and abide
<lb/>Within this land so long as thou mayst wish.
<lb/>I will illume mine eyes with seeing thee,
<pb n="130"/>
<lb/>And make thy rede the breastplate of my soul.
<lb/>Thou shalt go hence at will. I will not bid thee:
<lb/>'Abide awhile.' So with a robe of honour,
<lb/>And wealth, depart with joy—thou and thy chiefs,
<lb/>Well furnished. 'Tis no shame for thee to come
<lb/>To me; I have no quarrel with the Shah.
<lb/>On no wise be remiss in coming hither,
<lb/>And, when thou wouldst depart, then tarry not."
</p>

<p>This letter reached Bahram Gir and perturbed him.
<lb/>He called a scribe, wrote his reply, and planted
<lb/>A tree within the orchard of revenge.
<lb/>The letter thus began: "I have received
<lb/>Thy words. Thou canst have seen no land but Chin,
<lb/>For thou hast superscribed thy letter thus:
<lb/>'From him that is the monarch of the world,
<lb/>The most exalted of the glorious chiefs.'
<lb/>It is not so; new-fangled majesty
<lb/>Like thine I do not recognise. Bahram Gur
<lb/>Alone is king of kings; we know none other.
<lb/>No man remembereth any king like him
<lb/>In courage, knowledge, Grace, and lineage.
<lb/>Him I acknowledge, as victorious world-lord,
<lb/>And know him greater than all other kings.
<lb/>Again, for what thou saidst about my deeds,
<lb/>And of my toil endured in Hindustan,
<lb/>That too was all the star of Shah Bahram,
<lb/>Who hath Grace, throne, and fame. Accomplishment
<lb/>Is the franians' own, they hold fierce lions
<lb/>Of no account. They all are single-hearted;
<lb/>They worship God, and in their blest estate
<lb/>They fear no ill. Again, if king Shangul
<lb/>Bestowed his daughter on me I achieved
<lb/>That honour by my courage. He is great,
<lb/>By his own courage driveth wolf from sheep,
<lb/>And, thinking good to make affinity
<lb/>With me, bestowed on me his worthy child.
<pb n="131"/>
<lb/>Again, for what thou saidst: 'Arise and come,
<lb/>And I will guide thee unto every good,'
<lb/>'The Shah sent me to Hind, and shall I go
<lb/>To Chin for painted silk? If I propose
<lb/>A course like that he will approve it not.
<lb/>Thou sayest further: 'I will send thee home
<lb/>Enriched with treasures.' God hath set me past
<lb/>The need of clutching after others' goods.
<lb/>I praise Bahram for all his bounty to me,
<lb/>And offer up thanksgiving to my God
<lb/>Three watches of the day and of the night.
<lb/>And fourthly, all the praise that thou hast lavished
<lb/>Upon me in excess of my deserts,
<lb/>This I accept from thee, O king of Chin!
<lb/>And will report it to the Shah. May God
<lb/>Give thee so many blessings that the sky
<lb/>May not distinguish 'twixt their warp and woof."
</p>

<p>Bahram dispatched this letter to the king
<lb/>Of Chin when he had sealed it with his ring.
</p>

<head>§ 34
How Bahram fled from Hindustan to Iran with the
Daughter of Shangul</head>
<p>
<lb/>When with the daughter of Shangul Bahram
<lb/>Consorted she found out that he was Shah;
<lb/>By night and day she wept for love of him,
<lb/>And kept her eyes upon his face. Her father
<lb/>Heard of her love and ceased to doubt Bahram.
<lb/>One day the pair sat happily, discussing
<lb/>Things great and small, and Shah Bahram spake thus:—
<lb/>"I know that thou dost wish me well, so I
<lb/>Will tell to thee a secret; keep it close.
<lb/>I would quit Hindustan. Dost thou consent
<pb n="132"/>
<lb/>Thereto? I will take thee withal, but none
<lb/>Among this folk must know. Within Iran
<lb/>My state surpasseth this and, furthermore,
<lb/>The Almighty is mine aid. If thou wilt go
<lb/>Thy wise decision will promote thy weal,
<lb/>In every place thy title shall be ‘queen,’
<lb/>And thine own sire shall kneel before thy throne."
<lb/>She said: "Exalted one! seek what is good,
<lb/>And turn not from the way of understanding.
<lb/>The best of womankind is she through whom
<lb/>A smile is always on her husband's face.
<lb/>If my pure purposes are not conformed
<lb/>To thy command I joy not in thy life."
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: "Then frame a scheme but tell it
<lb/>To none."
<lb/>She said: "O worthy of the throne!
<lb/>I will, with fortune's aid. Not much removed
<lb/>There is a place where festivals are held,
<lb/>For in the forest there my father feasteth.
<lb/>It is a place that men deem fortunate,
<lb/>And thither gather idol-worshippers.
<lb/>Hence to the forest is a score of leagues,
<lb/>And one must weep before the idols there.
<lb/>That is a place for hunting onager,
<lb/>A place too for the worshippers of God.
<lb/>Both king and host will set forth to the feast;
<lb/>He will not leave a soldier in the city.
<lb/>Go then if thou art minded to depart:
<lb/>Let feasts grow old but be thou young forever.
<lb/>Wait for five days, then when the world’s Light shineth,
<lb/>And he shall quit the city, get thee ready
<lb/>To go thyself."
</p>

<p>His wife’s words pleased Bahram,
<lb/>Who slept not till the dawn for thought.
<lb/>Now when
<lb/>The sun displayed its hand upon the sky,
<pb n="133"/>
<lb/>And dark night packed, he mounted on his steed,
<lb/>And rode forth with his weapons to the chase.
<lb/>He told his wife: "Make ready and tell none;
<lb/>Let us prepare and set out on our way."
</p>

<p>Bahram departed, neared the stream, and saw
<lb/>The baggage of some merchants on the road.
<lb/>They recognised him, and he bit his lip,
<lb/>For they were of Iran—bold travellers
<lb/>O’er sea and land. He bade them offer him
<lb/>No reverence; not even had he told
<lb/>His comrades what he purposed. To the merchants
<lb/>He said: "Shut fast your lips; on that depend
<lb/>Our profit and our loss, for if in Hind
<lb/>This secret be divulged the Iranian soil
<lb/>Will be as seas of blood. Enlarged is he
<lb/>Whose lips are shut, the tongue must be confined,
<lb/>And both hands open. By a mighty oath
<lb/>Will I bind fast your tongues till I regain
<lb/>My throne. Say thus then: ‘May we turn away
<lb/>From God, the Holy and Supreme, and follow
<lb/>The Div if ever we desert the counsel
<lb/>Of Shah Bahram and contemplate ill-doing.’"
<lb/>When this oath had been taken and confirmed,
<lb/>So that the Shah’s heart was relieved from care,
<lb/>He said: "Guard well my secret, tendering it
<lb/>Like life itself, if ye desire to turn
<lb/>My bondage to a crown; but if the throne
<lb/>Be void of me armed hosts will come from all sides,
<lb/>And leave no merchants here, no Shah, no thane,
<lb/>No host, no throne, no crown."
<lb/>When they perceived
<lb/>The import of his words they came with cheeks
<lb/>All wet with weeping. "May the nobles’ lives
<lb/>Thy ransom be," they said, "and youth and kingship
<lb/>Thy habit. If the treasure of thy secret
<pb n="134"/>
<lb/>Should be revealed our country would resemble
<lb/>A sea of gore! Who dareth contemplate
<lb/>Such things and turn his wisdom to an ax,
<lb/>His counsel to a hatchet?"
</p>

<p>Hearing this,
<lb/>The Shah ’gan praise those honourable men
<lb/>Of Grace and Faith, and fared home ill at ease,
<lb/>Committing to God’s charge his soul and body.
<lb/>He tarried till the banquet-hall was decked,
<lb/>And till the nobles had departed thither,
<lb/>But when Shangul himself prepared to go
<lb/>Bahram’s wife said to him: "Barzu is sick,
<lb/>Would be excused, and saith: ‘Be not concerned
<lb/>For me, O king! The banquet-hall to one
<lb/>That aileth is distasteful, and the king
<lb/>Must know thus much.’"
<lb/>"Let none," Shangul replied,
<lb/>"That aileth think of banqueting."
</p>

<p>At dawn
<lb/>He left Kannauj and hurried to the place
<lb/>Of feasting. When 'twas night said Shah Bahram:
<lb/>"Tis time to go, good wife!"
<lb/>He seated her
<lb/>Upon her paltry and invoked God’s name
<lb/>O’er her in ancient Persian, donned his mail,
<lb/>And mounted too, his lasso in the straps,
<lb/>And mace in hand. He hurried to the river,
<lb/>And found the merchants sleeping. Rousing them
<lb/>He got a skiff in readiness wherein
<lb/>He seated Sapinud. With day begun
<lb/>They came to land, and brightly shone the sun.
<pb n="135"/>
</p>

<head>§ 35
How Shangul followed Bahram, learned who he was,
and was reconciled to him</head>
<p>
<lb/>A horseman from Kannauj sped with the tidings
<note n="1576"/>Of Shah Bahram’s departure, and Shangul,
<lb/>Who heard it from that loyal servant, quitted
<lb/>The chase as swift as fire. He hurried on
<lb/>Until he reached the river where he saw
<lb/>Both Sapinud and brave Bahram. He grieved,
<lb/>Crossed o’er in dudgeon, and upbraided thus
<lb/>His child: “O wicked wanton! thou hast passed,
<lb/>Bold as a lioness, across the river
<lb/>To go Iran-ward with this lusty knave,
<lb/>To desert waste from cultured paradise,
<lb/>Without my knowledge. Now thou shalt behold,
<lb/>Since thou hast left my pillow secretly,
<lb/>The impact of my double-headed dart.”
</p>

<p>Bahram replied: “O thou of evil mark!
<lb/>Why didst thou urge thy steed as madmen do?
<lb/>Thou hast had testimony that in war
<lb/>I am as with the cup and boon-companions.
<lb/>A hundred thousand men of Hindustan
<lb/>Before me would not equal, as thou knowest,
<lb/>One horseman like me and my thirty comrades,
<lb/>Famed, clad in mail, and wielding Persian swords.
<lb/>I will fulfil the Indians’ eyes with blood,
<lb/>And will not spare a soul.”
</p>

<p>Shangul was aware
<lb/>That he had spoken sooth because his prowess
<lb/>And valiancy could not be overlooked,
<lb/>But answered him: “I have foregone my children,
<lb/>My kindred, and allies, have held thee dearer
<lb/>Than mine own eyes, and as the diadem
<lb/>Upon my head, and given thee her whom thou
<lb/>Thyself didst choose. The right is on my side,
<pb n="136"/>
<lb/>The wrong on thine. Instead of good faith thou
<lb/>Hast chosen outrage. Ever hast thou heard
<lb/>Of good faith paid thereby? Shall I tell thee:—
<lb/>‘One of my kin and wise in mine esteem
<lb/>Hath gone off cavalierly, gone conceiving
<lb/>Himself a king?’ What hath a Persian’s heart
<lb/>In common with good faith? He sayeth ‘yea’
<lb/>And meaneth ‘nay’! Thou’rt such a lion’s whelp,
<lb/>In good sooth, as would bathe in their hearts’ blood
<lb/>Its nurses and, when fanged and sharp of claw,
<lb/>Would purpose combat with its fosterer!”
</p>

<p>Bahram made answer: “When thou knowest me
<lb/>How shalt thou call me ill in thought and deed?
<lb/>I shall be unreproached for having gone,
<lb/>Thou wilt not term my heart and conduct evil.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1577"/>
<lb/>The king of kings am I both of Iran
<lb/>And of Turan, the leader of the folk,
<lb/>The mainstay of the brave, and will requite
<lb/>Hereafter thy deservings and behead
<lb/>Thy foes, hold thee as father in Iran,
<lb/>And vex thee not with tribute for thy realm.
<lb/>Thy child shall be the Lustre of the West,
<lb/>And Crown of dames.”
</p>

<p>Astounded at his words
<lb/>Shangul took off his Indian turban, spurred
<lb/>His steed, and from the front of that great host
<lb/>Approached the Shah to make excuse, embraced
<lb/>The king of kings with joy, and sought to amend
<lb/>What had been said. He was rejoiced to see
<lb/>Bahram, prepared the board, and brought the cup.
<lb/>Bahram revealed the secret to Shangul,
<lb/>Discoursed of the concernments of Iran,
<lb/>And said: “Such circumstances and such thoughts
<lb/>Were those that guided me in this affair.”
<lb/>They both of them arose, the drinking done,
<lb/>And each asked pardon of the other one.

<head>§ 36
How Shangul went back to Hind and Bahram to Iran</head>
<p>
<lb/>These two kings—one a worshipper of God,
<lb/>The other an idolater—joined hands,
<lb/>And pledged themselves: "Henceforth we will not sever
<lb/>Our hearts from right, will raze each root of guile,
<lb/>Keep faith for aye, and listen to the words
<lb/>From sages’ lips."
</p>

<p>Shangul too bade farewell
<lb/>To Sapinud, he made his breast the warp
<lb/>And hers the woof. The two kings quickly turned
<lb/>Their backs on one another and flung down
<lb/>The rancour of their hearts upon the dust.
<lb/>One land-ward went, the other river-ward,
<lb/>Apace and glad.
<lb/>When tidings reached Iran:—
<lb/>"The Shah himself with those escorting him
<lb/>Hath come back from Kannauj," the people all,
<lb/>As they were minded, decked the roads and cities,
<lb/>And everywhere strewed money, musk, and saffron.
<lb/>When Yazdagird received the news he gathered
<lb/>The scattered troops. He and Narsi, the high priest,
<lb/>And all the sages, went to meet the Shah.
<lb/>When Yazdagird beheld his sire Bahram
<lb/>He lighted down and bent him to the dust.
<lb/>Narsi, the monarch’s brother, and withal
<lb/>The high priest had cheeks dust-stained but glad hearts.
<lb/>On such wise Shah Bahram came to his palace,
<lb/>Committing soul and body both to God.
</p>

<p>
<lb/>He rested when the world grew dark and while 
<lb/>The moon was like a silvern shield, but when
<lb/>Day rent night’s raiment, and the world’s Light showed,
<pb n="138"/>
<lb/>The king of kings sat on his golden throne,
<lb/>Gave audience but refrained his lips from speech.
<lb/>Came all the nobles with the men of lore,
<lb/>And princes of the empire, then the world-lord
<lb/>Rose on his throne and spake words just and holy,
<lb/>First spake of the Creator, then discharged
<lb/>His debt<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> to wisdom, and thus said: "Revere
<lb/>The Almighty in whose ken the manifest
<lb/>And hidden are, Him praise, and unto Him
<lb/>Address thy supplications midst night’s gloom,
<lb/>For he hath given power and victory,
<lb/>And is the Lord of shining sun and moon.
<lb/>All ye that would gain Paradise abstain
<lb/>From evil and foul deeds. Where there is Justice
<lb/>With bounteousness and righteousness the heart
<lb/>Will turn from guile and loss. Let none henceforth
<lb/>Fear me though he possesseth hills of gold,
<lb/>And mines of silver. From your hearts expel
<lb/>All fear and seek addition of all good.
<lb/>The peasant and the thane are one to us
<lb/>When we are judge. When we gave crown and throne
<lb/>To any know that ‘twas from God and fortune.
<lb/>I will strive not to fill my treasury,
<lb/>I would drive not my people from their homes.
<lb/>One treasure only—justice—will I hoard
<lb/>That after death my spirit may rejoice.
<lb/>Thus too, God willing, will my heart grow bright,
<lb/>And fortune smile. Hereby I shall increase
<lb/>Our blessings and direct you to fair fortune.
<lb/>He who hath borne oppression from my troops,
<lb/>Officials, kin, and cavaliers of war,
<lb/>And doth acquaint me not, but keepeth hidden
<lb/>That knavery, is guilty of the crime;
<lb/>Will one so futile ever endeavour greatness?
<pb n="139"/>
<lb/>I call to God for justice on the man
<lb/>That hath concealed the moon behind a cloud;
<lb/>But if your will is other, for men’s motives
<lb/>Are diverse, tell me boldly; haply I
<lb/>May bring to pass your long-conceived desires.
<lb/>Attend to me, do what I bid, and find
<lb/>Your souls’ peace in my counsels."
</p>

<p>Thus he spake,
<lb/>Resumed his seat upon the throne, rejoicing,
<lb/>And set the crown of greatness on his head.
<lb/>The nobles praised him, saying: "May the crown
<note n="2">Reading with P.</note> And signet ne’er lack thee. Realm, crown, and throne
<lb/>All glory in a Shah that is both wise,
<lb/>And of victorious fortune, but with thee
<lb/>Thy hardihood, thy knowledge, and thy Grace
<lb/>Are greater than the throne of king of kings.
<lb/>A Shah like thee the world remembereth not
<lb/>For manliness, for treasure, and for justice.
<lb/>To bless thee is incumbent on us all,
<lb/>Both young and old, and we will glorify thee
<lb/>To God and in the presence of our folk.
<lb/>No Shah hath sat upon this throne of gold
<lb/>Like thee in justice, victory, and might.
<lb/>Thou raisest from the dust the dead by justice,
<lb/>By goodly speech, and by munificence.
<lb/>May God almighty be thine aid, and may
<lb/>The head of fortune’s star be in thy lap."
</p>

<p>The mighty men and sages prosperous
<lb/>Went from the monarch’s throne with songs of joy.
<lb/>Then mounting with his troops he drew anear
<lb/>The precincts of Azargashasp. He lavished
<lb/>His gold and jewels on the mendicants,
<lb/>On those especially that hid their want.
<lb/>The high priest of the Fire-fane of Zarduhsht
<lb/>Came muttering prayers with sacred twigs in hand.
<lb/>The Shah brought Sapinud to him, and he
<pb n="140"/>
<lb/>Instructed her in custom, Faith, and rite,
<lb/>In limpid water and the good religion
<lb/>Bathed her and banned from her dust, rust, and soil.<note n="3">la débarrassa de la poussière et de la rouille de l’idolâtrie. <bibl>Mohl</bibl></note>
<lb/>The Shah unlocked the prisons and began
<lb/>Bestowing gifts of drachms on every man.

How Shangul with seven Kings visited Bahram</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now from his child—the consort of the Shah—
<lb/>Shangul heard of the doings of her spouse,
<lb/>And was desirous to behold Iran—
<lb/>The dwelling of the noble monarch’s daughter.
<lb/>He sent an Indian eloquent and noble
<lb/>As envoy to request the Shah to grant
<lb/>Another treaty to be stored away
<lb/>For record, and the world’s lord had one drawn
<lb/>Like shining Sol in jocund Paradise.
<lb/>The envoy took withal a letter written
<lb/>In ancient Persian by the Shah’s own hand,
<lb/>And went his way.<note n="1">Reading with P.</note> Now when he reached Shangul,
<lb/>And when the monarch of Kannauj had seen
<lb/>Bahram Gur’s letter, he prepared to journey
<lb/>From Hindustan, but hid it from his kindred
<lb/>In Chin. Seven monarchs followed in his train,
<lb/>Escorting Raja Shangul upon his way—
<lb/>The monarch of Kabul, the king of Hind,
<lb/>The king of Sind with troops, the famous king
<milestone unit="calced" n="1580"/>
<lb/>Who ruled Sandal, the monarch of Jandal,
<lb/>A potent prince, the monarch of Kashmir,
<lb/>A man of mastery, and last of all
<lb/>The great and glorious monarch of Multan,
</p>
<p>
<lb/>All coveters of honour, all with crowns,
<lb/>All wearing torques and earrings, all with escorts
<lb/>And camp-equipment, all of them renowned,
<lb/>Of high estate and rank, all exquisite
<lb/>With silver, gold, and gems; their parasols
<lb/>Were all of peacocks’ plumes, their elephants
<lb/>Had housings of brocade, their escorts glittered
<lb/>O’er miles with offerings for the Shah and gifts,
<lb/>Such that dinars seemed worthless in his eyes.
<lb/>Thus king Shangul and those seven kings withal
<lb/>Proceeded stage by stage, and, when they neared
<lb/>Iran with all their precious equipage,
<lb/>The Shah, informed of their approach, arrayed
<lb/>A host to go to meet them while the chiefs
<lb/>Of every city went to welcome them.
<lb/>The king of kings in wisdom old, and wary
<lb/>Though young in years, advanced to Nahrawan.
<lb/>The two illustrious and exalted kings
<lb/>Drew near to one another, both of them
<lb/>Alighted from their steeds and, as they met,
<lb/>Both offering greetings and apologies,
<lb/>Embraced. Both retinues alighted too:
<lb/>The world was full of babble. Much talk passed
<lb/>On matters great and small when thus the kings
<lb/>Of these two kingdoms met. They both remounted,
<lb/>As did their worshipful and famous troops.
<lb/>Bahram Gur set him up within his halls
<lb/>A golden throne draped as the custom was,
<lb/>Set wine upon the board and furnished minstrels.
<lb/>The whole place rang with song. He spread a board,
<lb/>An arrow-flight in length, with roasted lambs<note n="2">Cf. Vol. vi. p. 238 and note.</note>
<lb/>And fowls. The eating done, he held a revel
<lb/>In royal wise—all colour, scent, and beauty.
<lb/>The handmaids and the slave-boys stood around,
<lb/>Throne, hall, and palace were like Paradise,
</p>
<pb n="142"/>
<p>
<lb/>The wine-cups were all crystal, there were chargers
<lb/>All golden, musk, and scents. The revellers
<lb/>Wore jewelled crowns and shoes depict with gems.
<lb/>Shangul was in amazement at the palace,
<lb/>And as he drank he pondered: “Is Iran
<lb/>A paradise or garden where one’s friends
<lb/>Exhale the scent of musk?”
<lb/>Thus to the Shah
<lb/>Said he in private: “Let me see my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Bahram bade eunuchs of the company
<lb/>Conduct him to that Moon. The noble king
<lb/>Went with them and beheld another palace
<lb/>Like spring. When he beheld her on her throne
<lb/>Of ivory, crowned with an amber crown,
<lb/>He came and kissed her on the head, and laid
<lb/>His cheek to hers and wept exceedingly
<lb/>For love of her as did the Fair o’er him.
<lb/>He stroked her hand and speaking of that hall,
<lb/>That palace, and reception-room, he said:—
<lb/>"Behold a paradise! Thou hast escaped
<lb/>A wretched palace and a foul abode.”
<lb/>The gifts that he had brought with him—the purses,
<lb/>The crowns, and slaves withal, the gems and raiment,
<lb/>Whose value none knew how to estimate,
<lb/>He gave to her. He gave great largess too,
<lb/>And that blithe home was like a garth in spring.
<lb/>Departing thence he went back to the Shah,
<lb/>Disposed for drinking by his happiness.
<lb/>Now when the lords were merry with the wine
<lb/>Shangul departed to his couch to sleep,
<lb/>And, when the Veil of musky hue appeared
<lb/>With stars to spot it like a leopard’s back,
<lb/>The revellers betook them to sweet slumber,
<lb/>While all the attendants stood with folded arms.
<lb/>Thus was it till that golden Cup appeared,
<pb n="143"/>
<lb/>Which thou wouldst call the sun, flung off the cloak
<lb/>Of lapis-lazuli, and strewed the waste
<lb/>With topazes; then valiant Shah Bahram
<lb/>Went forth to hunt and took the Indian kings,
<lb/>Went to the chase with cheetahs, hawks, and falcons<note n="3">Cf. p. 76, note.</note>
<lb/>Imperious. For a while they did not irk
<lb/>Their hearts, not one of them felt pain and grief
<lb/>As for a month they hunted on the waste
<lb/>Gazelle and onager. Then they returned
<lb/>With instancy to wine and festival.
<lb/>Thus king Shangul, when hunting and when feasting,
<lb/>Ne’er was long absent from the world-lord’s side,
<lb/>Or at the riding-ground, at merrymake,
<lb/>At banquet and at polo, turned his face
<lb/>For one day from the Shah. A long while passed,
<lb/>The Indian king prepared to journey home.
<lb/>He sought his daughter with a loving heart,
<lb/>And stayed with her a while. He bade a slave-boy
<lb/>Bring pen and paper to him, then he sought
<lb/>For phrases scented with black, pounded musk,
<lb/>And wrote in Indian a righteous rescript,
<lb/>As it were ancient Persian. First he praised
<lb/>Him who had washed the world of its distress,
<milestone unit="calced" n="1582"/>
<lb/>Had spread abroad integrity and right,
<lb/>And flung black lies and loss upon the Div:—
<lb/>"I serve upon the way of use and Faith,
<lb/>Not that of anger or for vengeance sake.
<lb/>I have bestowed my daughter Sapinud
<lb/>As wife on Shah Bahram, that noble prince.
<lb/>May he live ever as the king of kings,
<lb/>And be the great ones of the world his slaves.
<lb/>As soon as I shall quit this Wayside Inn
<lb/>Let king Bahram become Rai of Kannauj.<note n="4">Cf. p. 140, note.</note>
<lb/>Transgress not the commandment of that king,
<lb/>And carry my dead body to the fire.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Give up my treasury to Shah Bahram,
<lb/>And therewithal crown, kingdom, throne, and casque.”
<lb/>This deed of gift in Indian characters
<lb/>On silk he gave to Sapinud as hers.

How Shangul returned to Hindustan, and how Bahram
remitted the Property-tax to the Landowners</head>
<p>
<lb/>Shangul abode for two months in Iran,
<lb/>And then dispatched a noble to the Shah
<lb/>To ask permission to depart, both he
<lb/>And his illustrious counsellors, for home.
<lb/>The king of kings consented that Shangul
<lb/>Should start on his return to Hindustan,
<lb/>And bade an archimage to choose among
<lb/>The treasures of Iran—dinars, gems, silver,
<lb/>Gold, thrones and crowns, swords, girdles and brocade,
<lb/>And stuffs uncut—unbounded, countless gifts
<lb/>To give Shangul while for his suite he furnished,
<lb/>To each in his degree, steeds and brocade
<lb/>Of Chin, dismissed them happy and content,
<lb/>And went three stages with Shangul. Besides
<lb/>The gifts he gave them provand to the coasts
<lb/>Of Hindustan.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When Shah Bahram returned
<lb/>He sat in peace upon the throne, but mused
<lb/>Of death and of ill fortune till his heart
<lb/>Ached and his face grew wan. He bade a scribe—
<lb/>A noble archmage who was his vizir—
<lb/>To come to him and bade him to inspect
<lb/>The treasury and reckon up the gold,
<lb/>The gems, and raiment, for astrologers
<lb/>Had told him, and the words had troubled him:

<pb n="145"/>
<lb/>“Thy life will last three score of years, the fourth score
<lb/>Will make thee weep at death,” and he had said:

<milestone unit="calced" n="1583"/>
<lb/>“The first score years will I devote to pleasure,
<lb/>Will set joy as a shoot within my soul,
<lb/>And in the next will justify the world
<lb/>By equity and liberality
<lb/>In public and in private. I will leave
<lb/>No corner waste and will provide for all.
<lb/>In the third score I will entreat the Lord;
<lb/>Perchance He will direct me on my way.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The astrologer said sixty years and three,
<lb/>But of the three the reckoning was not clear,
<lb/>And so the Shah desired sufficient treasure
<lb/>To meet the presage of the astrologer,
<lb/>Else would he have not self-reproach and travail?
<lb/>The treasurer went to the treasury,
<lb/>On hearing this, and laboured at the account.
<lb/>He toiled exceedingly till he had told
<lb/>The total to the monarch’s minister,
<lb/>Who thereupon went to the famous Shah,
<lb/>And said: “For three and twenty years to come
<lb/>In sooth thou wilt need naught. I have allowed
<lb/>For provand, largess, and thy famed troops’ pay,
<lb/>For envoys that arrive from other kings,
<lb/>And from thine own famed provinces, and thou
<lb/>Possessest for these years a treasury filled
<lb/>With silver, gold, and goods.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>On hearing this
<lb/>Bahram took thought, he was too wise to sorrow
<lb/>Beforehand, and replied: “My sway is ending.
<lb/>This world, if thou reflectest, hath three days.
<lb/>Since yesterday is over, and to-morrow
<lb/>Not come, to-day I stoop not under care.
<lb/>As I have means of largess and a throne
<lb/>Of ivory I will have no more tax.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He bade that no tax should be asked thenceforth

<pb n="146"/>
<lb/>From small and great. He set up in each city
<lb/>A man to rouse the drowsy and check strife
<lb/>Wherefrom proceedeth naught save evil deeds.
<lb/>He gave those wise archmages what was needful
<lb/>By way of provand, clothes, and draperies
<lb/>Out of his treasury, and said to them:
<lb/>“Ye must hide nothing good and bad from me.
<lb/>Be ye the arbitrators of disputes,
<lb/>Make no demands that make yourselves vexatious,
<lb/>Report both good and ill, and cut my fears
<lb/>Concerning evils short.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>This thing obtained
<lb/>Throughout the world, and nothing good and bad
<lb/>Remained concealed. Those sages ordered all,
<lb/>But still from every province letters came,
<lb/>Which said: “Through bounty, idleness, and wealth
<lb/>The brains of men are ceasing to be wise.
<milestone unit="calced" n="1584"/>
<lb/>There is such strife and bloodshed in the world
<lb/>That young men set no value on the great;
<lb/>The young men’s hearts are filled with many things,
<lb/>But not with thoughts of Shah and archimage.
<lb/>Their faces they have turned from gain to guile,
<lb/>They have grown troublesome and combative.
<lb/>The peasants, landowners, and unemployed,
<lb/>All give themselves to battle and contention.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>When letters of this kind arrived the Shah
<lb/>Was heart-pierced at the bloodshed. In each province
<lb/>He chose officials, wise and understanding
<lb/>As was befitting, and provided them
<lb/>Out of his treasury with food and raiment,
<lb/>The means for largess, and its allocation,
<lb/>And for six months established offices,
<lb/>Requiring of his subjects drachms in payment,
<lb/>And stamping “tax” on silver thus received.
<lb/>The officers wore crowns and had great state.

<pb n="147"/>
<lb/>For six months he received, for six gave back
<lb/>To wretched mendicant and man of birth.
<lb/>He strove in this way to keep men of war
<lb/>From bloodshed and inaugurating ill.
<lb/>Again his agents wrote: “Munificence
<lb/>Hath robbed the world of its security,
<lb/>For they that have the money pay no tax,
<lb/>But only meditate more bickerings.
<lb/>Instead of being crass they have grown cruel,
<lb/>They are all troublesome and quarrelsome.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when Bahram Gur had perused this letter
<lb/>His heart was troubled at such deeds. He bade:
<lb/>“Treat in accord to God's decree all those
<lb/>That shed blood or employ deceit, that all
<lb/>May find the means of livelihood.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He chose
<lb/>A marchlord full of justice and of knowledge
<lb/>For every province as was fit. He gave them
<lb/>A court-allowance for a year, invoking
<lb/>The Giver of all good. Much time passed by,
<lb/>And then the monarch had a letter sent
<lb/>To those truth-speaking men and correspondents,
<lb/>Whom he had scattered through the world, to ask:
<lb/>“What is there in the world unprofitable,
<lb/>And bringeth injury upon this realm?”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They wrote in answer: “Through the monarch’s gifts
<lb/>No man observeth rule and precedent.
<lb/>There is no thought or care for tilth or toil
<lb/>Wherefrom man’s worth deriveth. We behold
<lb/>Draught-oxen straying and the herbage lush
<lb/>In tilth and springing crop.”
<lb/>The Shah rejoined:
<lb/>“Till midday, when the world-illuming sun

<pb n="148"/>
<lb/>Is at its height, the tiller of the soil
<lb/>Must rest not from his work. The other half
<lb/>Is for repose and sleep. If men are fools
<lb/>We can but weep for them. If any lacketh
<milestone unit="calced" n="1585"/>
<lb/>Fruits, seed, and oxen be not stern and harsh
<lb/>Toward him but kind and aid him from my treasures
<lb/>That none may be distressed by indigence.
<lb/>So likewise if the weather causeth loss,
<lb/>And nobody is sovereign o’er the weather,
<lb/>Or locusts anywhere conceal the earth,
<lb/>And eat the herbage to the naked soil,
<lb/>Give compensation from the treasury.
<lb/>Proclaim this edict in the provinces.
<lb/>If there are sterile routes or if the land
<lb/>Be but a waste and all uncultivate,
<lb/>And whether it be owned by rich or poor,
<lb/>From such as I describe demand not aught,
<lb/>And if a man, one of my servitors,
<lb/>Or mine own foster-sire, shall take one mite
<lb/>Him will I bury on the spot alive:
<lb/>God give him neither home nor dwelling-place.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>They sealed the letter with the royal ring,
<lb/>And sent the camel-posts a-hurrying.
</p>

<head>§ 39
How Bahram summoned Gypsies from Hindustan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thereafter he sent letters to each archmage,
<lb/>Gave clothing to the mendicants, and asked:
<lb/>“In all the realm what folk are free from toil,
<lb/>And who are mendicants and destitute?
<lb/>Tell me how things are in the world, and lead
<lb/>My heart upon the pathway toward the light.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>An answer came from all the archimages,
<lb/>From all the nobles, and the men of lore:
<lb/>The face of earth appeareth prosperous,
<lb/>Continuous blessings are in every part,
<pb n="149"/>
<lb/>Save that the poor complain against the ills
<lb/>Of fortune and the Shah. ‘The rich,’ they say,
<lb/>‘Wear wreaths of roses in their drinking-bouts,
<lb/>And quaff to minstrelsy, but as for us
<lb/>They do not reckon us as men at all.
<lb/>The empty-handed drinketh with no rose
<lb/>Or harp.’ The king of kings should look to it.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The Shah laughed heartily at this report,
<lb/>And sent a camel-post to king Shangul
<lb/>To say thus: “O thou monarch good at need!
<lb/>Select ten thousand of the Gypsy-tribe,
<lb/>Both male and female, skilful on the harp,
<lb/>And send them to me. I may gain mine end
<lb/>Through that notorious folk.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Now when the letter
<lb/>Came to Shangul he raised his head in pride
<milestone unit="calced" n="1586"/>
<lb/>Over Saturn’s orbit and made choice of Gypsies,
<lb/>As bidden by the Shah who, when they came,
<lb/>Accorded them an audience and gave each
<lb/>An ox and ass, for he proposed to make
<lb/>The Gypsies husbandmen, while his officials
<lb/>Gave them a thousand asses’ loads of wheat,
<lb/>That they might have the ox and ass for work,
<lb/>Employ the wheat as seed for raising crops,
<lb/>And should besides make music for the poor,
<lb/>And render them the service free of cost.
<lb/>The Gypsies went and ate the wheat and oxen,
<lb/>Then at a year’s end came with pallid cheeks.
<lb/>The Shah said: “Was it not your task to plough,
<lb/>To sow, and reap? Your asses yet remain,
<lb/>So load them up, prepare your harps, and stretch
<lb/>The silken chords.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>And so the Gypsies now,
<lb/>According to Bahram’s just ordinance,
<lb/>Live by their wits; they have for company
<lb/>The dog and wolf, and tramp unceasingly.
<pb n="150"/>
</p>

<head>§ 40
How the Time of Bahram came to an End</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thus passed he three score years and three, and had
<lb/>No equal in that age. With New Year came
<lb/>The scribe—the wise archmage, his minister—
<lb/>And said to him: “The treasury of the king
<lb/>Of mighty men is void, and I have come
<lb/>For thy command. Those that enjoyed this wealth
<lb/>Expect us not to levy any tax.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The monarch answered: “Take no further pains,
<lb/>For I have passed beyond the need thereof.
<lb/>Resign the world to its Creator—Him
<lb/>Who manifested forth His works. The heavens
<lb/>Will pass away, but God abideth ever
<lb/>To guide both thee and me to what is good.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>He slept that night, and early in the morn
<lb/>A countless crowd resorted to his court.
<lb/>They brought together all that were required,
<lb/>And young prince Yazdagird approached the Shah,
<lb/>Who gave him in the presence of the lords
<lb/>The crown and bracelets, torque and ivory throne.
<lb/>Intending to devote himself to God
<lb/>He cast away the crown, he left his seat,
<lb/>And hasted to resign the world’s affairs.
<lb/>At night-fall he was eager for repose,
<lb/>And, when the sun displayed its head above
<lb/>The deep, fear filled his archimage’s heart,
<lb/>Who thought: “The Shah ariseth not from sleep
<lb/>Unless he hath withdrawn him from the lords.”
</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="calced" n="1587"/>
<lb/>Then Yazdagird drew near his sire and spied
<lb/>What froze the breath upon his lips—Bahram
<lb/>With faded cheeks lay dead on gold brocade!
<lb/>The day of gloom is as it was of yore,
<lb/>Sear not thy heart with greed and lust of more.
<pb n="151"/>
<lb/>At death the cores of stones and iron quail,
<lb/>And here thy strivings are of no avail.
<lb/>Thou shouldst be inoffensive and humane;
<lb/>Why seek addition with its biting bane?
<lb/>Woe for that great Shah and his equity!
<lb/>Oh! never derogate his memory.
<lb/>Of fifty monarchs of seed royal sown,
<lb/>Who girt their loins upon the Iranian throne,
<lb/>Bahram Gur had no like in eminence,
<lb/>In justice, puissance, and excellence.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have called king Rustam but vizir
<lb/>To him though Rustam sent his arrows sheer
<lb/>Through mounts of iron, yet was there no delay
<lb/>When Shah Bahram Gur’s term had passed away.
<lb/>What profit had he from his valour’s day?
<lb/>For forty days the Shah bewailed his sire,
<lb/>The host wore raiment black and blue, and when
<lb/>The charnel closed o’er that famed warrior Shah
<lb/>“He bore off bounty,” thou hadst said, “with him.”
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Sun, moon, and Venus, Saturn, crown, and throne,
<lb/>A Shah, like this one, ne’er will look upon.
<lb/>Woe for that royal mien, that height, and Grace!
<lb/>Woe for that lofty star, that hand, and mace!
<lb/>He decked the throne and crown, from Rum and Chin
<lb/>Took toll and tax, yet passed as he had been
<lb/>Some starving mendicant! When all was done
<lb/>What profited his halls aloft the sun?
<lb/>He and the pauper fare the selfsame path,
<lb/>And each of grief and pain a scantling hath.
<lb/>The dear delights of earth, the sovereign sway,
<lb/>What boot they? Soon thy rule will pass away.
<lb/>Blest is the pious mendicant and wise,
<lb/>Whose ears oft feel the world’s rough pleasantries,
<lb/>For, when he passeth, he will leave behind
<lb/>A good name and a good conclusion find.
<lb/>His portion is in heaven, and in God’s sight
<pb n="152"/>
<lb/>He will have honour, not be in my plight,
<lb/>In miserable case, calamitous,
<lb/>With all that I possess sent Hell-ward thus
<lb/>Beyond recall! No hope in heaven I see,
<lb/>My hand is void, both worlds have ruined me!
<lb/>Now, if I can collect my thoughts again,
<lb/>The rule of Yazdagird shall be my strain.
