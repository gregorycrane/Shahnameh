<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>
<p><persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> succeeds to the throne during the lifetime of his grandfather, <rs type="role">Shah</rs> <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, and swears to him to avenge the death of <persName>Siyawush</persName>. This he achieves after long wars and vicissitudes of fortune ; and then, fearing that, like <persName>Jamshid</persName>, he too may fall away from holiness by reason of his great successes and half descent from <persName>Tur</persName>, prays that he may be taken from the world, its temptations, and its evil. His prayers are granted, and, having appointed his successor, he is caught up alive to heaven. In the course of the reign the poet tells two episodic stories, that of the div <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>, and that of <persName>Bizhan</persName> and Manizha.
</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p><persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> is the last of the <rs type="role">Shahs</rs> in whose names we can trace a connexion with <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> mythology. In the <rs type="title">Vedas</rs> he appears as Sushrdvas. In the <rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs> he is Kavi Husravah and is mentioned often. Like his grandfather <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> he originated in the ancient nature-worship of the <rs type="ethnic">Aryan</rs> race, and a trace of his divine origin still clings to him in the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs>, as is shown by his exemption from death. The story of his birth and youth will be found in the reign of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, Parts IV. and V.<ref target="n.7.1"/>
The reign of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> is the longest in the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs> and forms more than a fifth of the whole poem. It is nearly twice as long as <q> Paradise Lost</q> and <q> Paradise Regained</q> combined. It is divided into seven Parts, of which Parts IV. and V. are episodic.
<note n="7.1">See Vol. ii.</note>
<pb n="8"/>
The others carry on and bring to a conclusion the story of the old epic cycle of <placeName>Iran</placeName>, the deaths of <persName>Iraj</persName>, <persName>Naudar</persName>, <persName>Ighriras</persName>, and
<persName>Siyawush</persName> are avenged, and the royal house of <placeName>Turan</placeName> becomes extinct. Early in the reign a new motive of great importance is introduced, that of the slaughter of the descendants of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, who in Part VI. has his revenge on <persName>Piran</persName>, just as in Part VII.
<persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> avenges himself on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>. By the end of the
reign a clean sweep has been made on the <rs type="ethnic">Turanian</rs> side, while on the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> a great clearance has been effected. Many heroic names drop out of sight, <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> and his half-brother <persName>Farud</persName> leave no issue,<ref target="n.8.1"/> and in the next reign the curtain rises on a complete change of scene and motive. Only <persName>Zal</persName> and his descendants—great relics of the heroic past—still continue to play their part among <q> new faces, other minds.</q></p>
<p>The story is one of almost unceasing warfare, for even the episodes end with battles against <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>. Omitting these, four campaigns are fought, the first in Part I., the second in
Parts II. and III., the third in Part VI., and the fourth in
Part VII. The successive campaigns become more and more elaborate in the method of their presentation, and set forth the gradual progress of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> arms from total defeat to absolute triumph.
In the course of the reign we find a mass of subject-matter of comparatively late growth. It is only in Part VII. that the older legendary strata crop up, and we again find ourselves in touch with the <rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs>, while it is not till the concluding scenes of all that we come upon the ancient legend which may be regarded as the bed-rock of the whole. Another version of it occurs near the end of the great <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> epic, the Mahdbhirata.<ref target="n.8.2"/>
This will be given in the Introductory Note to Part VII. in
Vol. IV. of this translation, where it may be compared most conveniently with its <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> equivalent.
It was stated in the Introduction<ref target="n.8.3"/> that the Sh4hnama was divisible into two periods—a mythic and a historic—and the distinction was based not so much on the nature of the subject- matter as on the names of the chief characters which at a certain point cease to be mythic and become historic. As regards the names of the <rs type="role">Shahs</rs>, which were there referred to, this is correct.
We are still far from the point in the poem at which such names begin to appear in their proper historic connexion of time and
<note n="8.1">In the <rs type="title">Zandavasta</rs>, however, <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> is represented as having a son named Akhrura, whose legend is lost. DZA, ii. 223.</note>

<pb n="9"/> place, but it does not follow that all the names occurring before that point is reached are wholly mythical. Real dynastic, family, and personal names are found thrown back upon and incorporated with a mythical past with which they have no connexion whatever. The dynastic title of Caesar, for instance, occurs in the reign of Minvchihr,<ref target="n.9.1"/> while the personified name—<persName>Karan</persName>—of a family famous in Ashkanian (Parthian) and Sisdnian times is very prominent in the Pishdddian dynasty. The most striking in- stances of personal names and personalities being thus thrown back occur in the Kaidnian dynasty and in the reigns of Kai
<persName>Kaus</persName> and <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>. These we will now proceed to con- sider. 
About a.D. 40 the Parthian king Artabanus III. died. He left at least two sons living at his death—Vardanes, who suc- ceeded him, and Artabanus. Shortly afterward, and during the absence of Vardanes from the capital, a certain Gotarzes assumed the supreme power and caused Artabanus with his wife and son to be murdered. The relationship of Gotarzes to Artabanus III. has been a matter of considerable difference of opinion, but seems fairly settled now by two pieces of contemporary evidence. On the rock of Bihistiin, some three hundred feet below the inscription of the great Darius, Gotarzes has left a memorial tablet of himself. Unfortunately it is now almost defaced,<ref target="n.9.2"/> but when the late Sir Henry Rawlinson examined it in 1836 he made out, in addition to the name Gotarzes, which is still legible,<ref target="n.9.3"/> the word
Mithrates, and Gotarzes' description of himself as <q>Satrap of
Satraps.</q> In one corner of the tablet the words <q>:Gotarzes
Geopothros</q> (Γωτάρζης Γεόποθρος) were also found. Sir Henry
Rawlinson’s account was read before the Royal Geographical
Society in January 1838.<ref target="n.9.4"/>
In the first element in the word <q>Geopothros</q> we have, as now seems generally admitted, the historical original of the <persName>Giv</persName> of the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs>. In the second element we have the old <rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs> word <q> puthra,</q> which means <q>son.</q> The whole word therefore means <q>son of <persName>Giv</persName>.</q> This historical <persName>Giv</persName> seems to have been prince of Hyrcania and the father-in-law of Artabanus III.<ref target="n.9.5"/> He was also, if we accept the evidence of the inscription, the father of Gotarzes.
The second piece of contemporary evidence is a very rare coin of Gotarzes in the corrupted legend on which he is described as <q>the king of kings, the Arsacid, the adopted son of Artabanus </q>

(υἱὸς κακαλούμενος or κεκλημένος Ἀρταβάνου).<ref target="n.10.1"/> It appears therefore that Gotarzes was closely connected with the reigning Parthian family both by marriage and adoption, but was not really one of the sons of Artabanus III. as was formerly supposed.
Vardanes, on hearing of Gotarzes' usurpation of the kingdom, hurried back and expelled him. Gotarzes withdrew into his hereditary principality of Hyrcania, where, with the assistance of the Dahae, who dwelt between the <placeName>Caspian</placeName> and the Aral, he prepared to renew the struggle. The opposing forces met on the Bactrian plains, but hostilities were averted. Gotarzes had discovered a plot, on the part of the Parthian nobles on both sides, to kill him and Vardanes, and set up a new king in their place. He informed Vardanes of this, and the two combined against the common enemy. Gotarzes then withdrew to Hyrcania and Vardanes retained the crown. Subsequently another war broke out between the two and several battles were fought.
Tacitus, the chief authority for this part of history, tells us<ref target="n.10.2"/> that Vardanes advanced to meet Gotarzes as far as the river
Erinde,<ref target="n.10.3"/> at the passage of which severe fighting took place in which Vardanes was victorious, who then in several successful engagements subdued all the nations between that river and the river Sinde, which divided the Dahae and the 
Aryans.<ref target="n.10.4"/> He returned in triumph, but shortly afterward was assassinated while hunting, 4.D. 46. Upon this Gotarzes became king, but his ferocity and self-indulgence speedily rendered him unpopular, and a Parthian deputation arrived in Rome in a.p. 49 for the purpose of obtaining from the Emperor Claudius permission for
Meherdates, who resided there, to accompany them back to
<placeName>Persia</placeName>. Meherdates was the son of a former Parthian king,
Vonones I. As was to be expected in the circumstances the character of Gotarzes was depicted in very unfavourable colours by the envoys. He had killed all his relations, whether near or distant, with their wives and children; he was sluggish at home, unfortunate in war, and sought to cloak his sloth by

<note n="10.4">The rivers Erinde and Sinde have not been identified, but the latter may be intended for the Oxus. That river was confounded with the <placeName>Indus</placeName> (<placeName>Sind</placeName>) in ancient times (see Vol. i. p. 71) and flowed into the <placeName>Caspian</placeName> in the days of Tacitus, so it might be regarded as dividing the Dahae and the Aryans.</note>
<pb n="11"/> cruelty.<ref target="n.11.1"/> Meherdates was sent accordingly, but was defeated and taken prisoner by Gotarzes, who, however, rather belied his character for ferocity on this occasion. He spared the life of
Meherdates and merely cut off his ears—a mutilation that dis- qualified him for the Parthian crown. It was to commemorate this victory that Gotarzes had the bas-relief already referred to carved on the rock of Bihistun, in the neighbourhood of which the battle probably was fought. Gotarzes is represented as charging at the head of his troops, while above him a winged
Victory is setting the crown upon his head.<ref target="n.11.2"/> He died in a.p. 51.
In the lists of the kings of the Ashkdanian (Parthian) dynasty, compiled by oriental historians,<ref target="n.11.3"/> the name <persName>Gudarz</persName> occurs in several connexions. We also find the’ name <persName>Bizhan</persName> given as the son of one <persName>Gudarz</persName> and as the father of another. We also find the name Bahr4m. <persName>Firdausi</persName>, when he reaches Ashkanian times, includes the above three names in his very scanty list of the kings of that dynasty. He admits that he knows nothing about any of them, being wholly unaware, as naturally he would be, of their identity with some of his own most favourite heroes.
In the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs> Gotarzes becomes <persName>Gudarz</persName>, who is represented as being the father, not the son, of <persName>Giv</persName>. Vardanes becomes
<persName>Bahram</persName> and is the son, not the adopted brother, of <persName>Gudarz</persName>.
<persName>Bizhan</persName> becomes the son of <persName>Giv</persName> and the grandson of <persName>Gudarz</persName>.
Similarly other names of the Parthian period appear in the poem.
Meherdates (Mithradates, Mithrates, Mithradit, Mihrdat) appears as Milad, the father of <persName>Gurgin</persName>, who plays such a prominent part in the story of <persName>Bizhan</persName> and Manizha, (Part V.). Phraates—a common
Parthian name—becomes Farhad, and there are other instances.<ref target="n.11.4"/>
Some of the names thus transplanted have flourished amazingly, and Gotarzes' reputation has not suffered by the change.
We conclude this note with a few instances in which the events of Parthian history summarized above may be traced in a distorted form in the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs>. In the war between Gotarzes and Vardanes we seem to have the origin of the campaigns of
<persName>Tus</persName> against <placeName>Turan</placeName> in Parts I. and II. The scene of operations is the same in both cases, and the battle at the river Erinde seems reproduced in that of the river Shahd.<ref target="n.11.5"/> The assassination of king Vardanes on the hunting-field is reproduced in the episode in which <persName>Bahram</persName>, having lost his whip on the battlefield, insists on returning to look for it, and is, after a gallant defence, mortally wounded by the enemy." It is because Meherdates, after marching

<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>
<p>The poet, first having set forth the various qualities that kings ought to possess, proceeds to tell how <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> becomes joint <rs type="role">Shah</rs> with <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, who exacts from him an oath that he will avenge the death of <persName>Siyawush</persName>. He accordingly assembles the host, and sends it, under the command of <persName>Tus</persName>, against <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, strictly enjoining the former not to attack Fartid—the half- brother of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>—on the march. Tuis out of dudgeon with <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> disobeys, and <persName>Farud</persName> is slain. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> subsequently are surprised in a night-attack by <persName>Piran</persName> and de- feated. <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> recalls <persName>Tus</persName> and appoints <persName>Fariburz</persName> leader, who arranges 4 month’s truce with <persName>Piran</persName>, after which the fight is renewed and the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> are overthrown at the disastrous battle of Ladan. They retreat to <placeName>Iran</placeName>, and <persName>Piran</persName> is splendidly rewarded by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>. The poet in this part records various heroic exploits of <persName>Giv</persName>, his son <persName>Bizhan</persName>, and his brother Bahriim, who is slain,</p>

<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p>§§ 1and 9. There are two Preludes in this Part. The first may be regarded as introductory to the whole reign, specifying as it does the ideal kingly qualities that are to be exemplified in the person of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, while the second is meant to impress upon the reader the real motives that underlay the conduct of <persName>Tus</persName> with reference to his treatment of <persName>Farud</persName>.  <persName>Tus</persName>, as we have seen, was a disappointed man.<ref target="n.13.1"/> Although he was the direct representative of the ancient Pishdddian Dynasty his claim to the crown invariably had been ignored. Despairing, moreover, of ever becoming <rs type="role">Shah</rs> himself he had just been advocating the claims of
<note n="13.1">Vol. ii. p. 335-</note>
<pb n="14"/>
<persName>Fariburz</persName> to the kingship, in opposition to those of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, in the hope of becoming at all events a king-maker and the power behind the throne. Again his plans are frustrated, and he vents his spite on <persName>Khusrau</persName>’s half-brother, <persName>Farud</persName>.
§ 6. The name of the slave of Tazhiv appears variously as
Isnapwi and Ispanwi. We adopt the latter.
§ 7. In <persName>Rustam</persName>’s account of the conquest of part of Zibulistan by the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> we seem to have a reminiscence of the permanent occupation of that country (c. 100 B.c.), from which it received the name of <placeName>Sistan</placeName>.<ref target="n.14.1"/> Similarly in <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, Part II, we had a reference to the invasions of Mesopotamia by the 
<rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs>.<ref target="n.14.2"/>
§ 10, Kalat is a word used for forts in general, but if, as seems probable, the particular stronghold referred to is that which is now known as Kalat-i-Nadiri, we here find ourselves in the poet’s own neighbourhood.  <persName>Tus</persName>, his native place, is said to have been founded by the legendary hero of that name, who plays so prominent a part in this portion of the Shdhnima, because, in consequence of the death of <persName>Farud</persName>, he was afraid to return to the court of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,<ref target="n.14.3"/> but we find nothing to this effect in the
<rs type="title">Shahnama</rs>. Kalat-i-Nidiri was so called because Nadir <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
(A.D, 1736-1747), one of the most remarkable of <rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs> sovereigns, whose uncle was the ruler of this fortress,<ref target="n.14.4"/> was born in its neighbourhood and made it his favourite residence. It is situated some forty miles to the north of the ruins of  <persName>Tus</persName>. <q>It is upon a very high hill, only accessible by two narrow paths. An ascent of six or seven miles terminates in a plain about twelve miles in circumference, watered by several fine streams and covered with verdure and cultivation. A second ascent, by a route of ten or eleven miles, leads to another plain of greater elevation, but of 
equal richness.</q><ref target="n.14.5"/></p>
<p><q>It is a district or a basin,</q> says another account, <q>fortified in the most wonderful way by nature. In shape it is something like a foot, and it must have a length of twenty miles by a breadth of two to four miles .. . if the term impregnable can be used anywhere, it can here. For the fifty miles of its circuit, nature has indeed left hardly anything for man to do.</q> <ref target="n.14.6"/>
§ 15. The <persName>Rivniz</persName> slain by <persName>Farud</persName> should be distinguished from the hero of the same name slain at Lidan (§ 30). The former was descended from <persName>Pashang</persName> <ref target="n.14.7"/> and therefore of Pishdadian descent. He is quite appropriately the son-in-law of <persName>Tus</persName>. The latter is a son of Kai Kis and therefore a Kaidnian.

§ 18. <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s friendship with <persName>Gustaham</persName>, the son of <persName>Gazhdaham</persName>, is one of the features of this reign. Another is <persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s anxiety about one another when either is courting danger. The father can never bring himself to realise that his son is grown up and well able to take care of himself, while the son, with all the insolence of youth, persists in regarding his father as played out— touches not foreign to human nature.
§ 30. The battle of Lidan is also known by the name of the battle of Pashan, and there is a legend that when <persName>Firdausi</persName> was on his way to seek his fortune at the court of Mahmud he chanced to enter a garden where three of the seven poets of Mahmiid’s court were revelling. He asked to be allowed to join them, and they consented on the condition that he should cap their three rhyming verses with a fourth. <persName>Firdausi</persName> at once obtained the needful rhyme by a verse referring to the battle of Pashan, whereby he showed his superior knowledge of the epic history of his country.<ref target="n.15.1"/> In this connexion the word has sometimes been understood as equivalent to <persName>Pashang</persName>, the name both of the father and of one of the sons of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, but <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s line was in- tended to celebrate the prowess of <persName>Giv</persName> at the battle of Pashan or
Ladan. It is possible, however, that these are the names of distinct battles though fought in the same campaign, in which case we may regard the former as the night-surprise and the latter as the occasion when Guidarz lost nearly all his descendants.
<persName>Giv</persName> distinguished himself at both battles.
The <q> mountain-skirt </q> to which the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> army withdrew after its defeat seems to be that of the northern scarp of the province of Khurdasdn which still goos by the name of Diaman-i-Kuh— the term used in the poem, cf. p. 10.

<lb/>When in the garth a cypress sendeth off
<lb/>A shoot, whose green top mounteth palace-high,
<lb/>The tree rejoiceth in the height thereof,
<lb/>Its prudent carriage, and prosperity,
<lb/>The heart of fortune nourisheth the shoot,

<lb/>If sovereignty to native worth be due
<lb/>The wearer of the crown must needs do right ;
<lb/>Three aspects of the matter let us view,
<lb/>And presently a fourth will come in sight :
<lb/>Accomplishment thou wilt not fail to find
<lb/>With high birth and with native worth combined.
<lb/>Such are the three, and all in one content,
<lb/>For save in company with native worth
<lb/>How can there ever be accomplishment,
<lb/>And, lacking that, what scion of high birth
<lb/>Hast thou beheld? High birth the father’s seed
<lb/>Produceth, which may well fair fruitage breed.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="766"/>
<lb/>Accomplishment thou learnest painfully
<lb/>From others, at the cost of many a groan,
<lb/>While native worth is greatest of the three—
<lb/>A robe of honour given by God alone.
<lb/>To these be wisdom added, that which will
<lb/>Discriminate for thee 'twixt good and ill.
<lb/>When any man possesseth all the four
<lb/>He hath repose from travail, greed, and grief,
<lb/>But not from death; that is an evil, sore
<lb/>Beyond all others; there is no relief.
<lb/>Now <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> possessed all four, and he
<lb/>Was fashioned thus by heaven’s destiny.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><head>How the Nobles did homage to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>When <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> acceded, and the world
<lb/>Had been apprised, he sat upon the throne
<lb/>Of king of kings and donned the crown of greatness.
<lb/>He meted justice out to each, uprooting
<lb/>Injustice from the earth. Then all the nobles,
<lb/>Possessed of crowns and sprung of royal race,
<lb/>With foreign monarchs, potentates, and magnates,
<lb/>Resorted to <persName>Khusrau</persName>: there was no head
<lb/>Not taken in his toils. He cultivated
<lb/>Waste lands and freed the mourners' hearts from woe;
<lb/>The moisture rained down from the clouds in spring,
<lb/>And cleansed the face of earth from rust and sorrow ;
<lb/>'Twas decked like Paradise with goodly havings
<lb/>By reason of his justice and his bounty.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="767"/>
<lb/>The world was full of happiness and peace,
<lb/>The hands of <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> were barred from ill,
<lb/>While envoys came from all the provinces,
<lb/>From every man of name and potentate.
<lb/>When tidings had been carried to <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>,
<lb/>And reached the chief, the Lustre of the earth :-—
<lb/><q>The glorious prince is seated on the throne,
<lb/>And hath his foot upon the sky of power,</q>
<lb/>He summoned his retainers from all sides
<lb/>To go to offer homage to the Shh,
<lb/>Departing on the journey in great state
<lb/>And much content with <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName>
<lb/>The son of <persName>Nariman</persName>, and all the nobles,
<lb/>Both great and little of <placeName>Kabul</placeName>—a host
<lb/>Which made the desert as 'twere ebony
<lb/>What while the tymbals split the leopards' ears.
<lb/><persName>Zal</persName> with an escort led the way; behind
<lb/>Came <persName>Rustam</persName> followed by the violet flag.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="768"/>
<pb n="18"/>
<lb/>When tidings reached the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>: <q> The loyal <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Is on his way,</q> the people as one man
<lb/>Arose prepared to go to welcome him.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> was glad and bade the courier: <q>Take
<lb/>Thy pleasure here, for <persName>Rustam</persName> reared my father,
<lb/>And all eyes recognise his excellence.</q>
<lb/>The monarch ordered <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and  <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>To set forth with the tymbals and the pipes,
<lb/>The drums beat at the portal of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And all the warriors assumed their helms.
<lb/>From every quarter of the land all went
<lb/>With flag and kettledrum to welcome <persName>Rustam</persName> ;
<lb/>While those in chief command with many troops
<lb/>Went forward two days' journey to receive him.
<lb/>As soon as <persName>Rustam</persName>’s standard came in sight,
<lb/>And when the host’s dust mounted o'er the sun,
<lb/>Shouts rose with sound of trump and kettledrum,
<lb/>And from the centre <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>Approached in haste the elephantine chieftain,
<lb/>And gave him salutations joyfully.
<lb/>All three of them embraced him ; he meanwhile—
<lb/>The lion-queller—asked about the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.
<lb/>From <persName>Rustam</persName> they proceeded next to <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName>Sam</persName>, with open hearts and happy,
<lb/>Then turned to Faramarz, rejoiced to see him.
<lb/>Thence they approached the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, approached to gaze
<lb/>Upon the glorious crown. Now when <persName>Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>Beheld the elephantine warrior
<lb/>Tears trickled from his eyelids down his cheeks.
<lb/>Descending from the throne he greeted <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Who kissed the ground. The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> said: <q> Paladin!
<lb/>Live ever glad and happy, for thou art
<lb/>The foster-sire of <persName>Siyawush</persName> and likewise
<lb/>Art of all men most wise and reticent.</q>
<lb/>He clasped upon his breast the head of <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>And sorrowed for his own sire’s sake the while,
<pb n="19"/>
<lb/>Then seated both chiefs on the royal throne,
<lb/>And blessed them in God’s name. When <persName>Rustam</persName> marked
<lb/>From head to foot the person of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And how he sat, held converse, and advised,
<lb/>The hero’s cheek flushed up and his heart ached,
<lb/>So much reminded him of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>He thus addressed the world’s king: <q>To the world
<lb/>Thou art, O <rs type="role">Shah</rs>! the memory of thy sire.
<lb/>I have not seen a king with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> like thine,
<lb/>Or one so like thy father.</q>
<lb/>When they rose
<lb/>They had the tables spread and wine prepared.
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> slept not till night was far advanced,
<lb/>But held more converse touching what had chanced.</p></div>

<lb/>When Sol had drawn its shining scimitar,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="769"/>
<lb/>As <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and valiant <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gurgin</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> the Lion, <persName>Gustaham</persName>, and others,
<lb/>Came to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> in that famed audience-hall.
<lb/>Now when they had assembled at his throne
<lb/>He said to them: <q>I purpose to survey
<lb/>The glorious realm and marches of <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>Go we in hunting wise and fleet a while
<lb/>In happiness.</q>
<lb/>The nobles all agreed.
<lb/>The monarch of the world went forth to hunt
<lb/>With <persName>Rustam</persName>, that illustrious paladin,
<lb/>With <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, <persName>Shapur</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName>, a wielder of the scimitar,
<pb n="20"/>
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName>, <persName>Bizhan</persName> expert in archery,
<lb/>Farhid and Zanga son.of Shiwaran,
<lb/>And one among the fighting-men, Guraza—
<lb/>A host that darkened both the sun and moon
<lb/>With helmets, maces, coats of mail, and casques.
<lb/>The tracks and trackless waste were like a field
<lb/>Of battle with the corpses of the game.
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> passed through the country of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>And subsidised and peopled all the lands
<lb/>That then were uninhabited or ravaged,
<lb/>Or ruined by misgovernment ; he found
<lb/>No toil in justice or munificence.
<lb/>He tarried in each city and set up
<lb/>His throne as fitted fortune’s favourite,
<lb/>Called for his purse and cup, and with dinars
<lb/>Decked all the world ; then sought another city,
<lb/>Conveying with him crown and throne and wine,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="770"/>
<lb/>Until with all the great men and the nobles
<lb/>He reached at length Azar Abddagan ;
<lb/>Then quaffing wine, and urging on his steed,
<lb/>Approached the temple of <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>,
<lb/>Prayed in that Fane of Fire and praised the Maker.
<lb/>He left in state to go back to <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>With whom they sat—a merry company—
<lb/>Not ceasing for a moment from their mirth

<lb/>With <persName>Zal</persName> and valiant <persName>Rustam</persName>. <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>
<lb/>Discoursed at large on matters great and small,
<lb/>And, first, in speaking of Afrasiy4b,
<lb/>Bathed both his cheeks with blood-drops from his eyes,
<lb/>Recounting what that king had perpetrated
<lb/>On <persName>Siyawush</persName>, and how he had sent up
<lb/>Dust from <placeName>Iran</placeName>, how many paladins
<lb/>Had died, and how their wives and children suffered,
<lb/>Thus saying: <q>Thou beholdest many cities
<lb/>Waste in <placeName>Iran</placeName>, wrecked by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Since every needful, God-sent gift is thine—
<lb/>Men, knowledge, might of hand, <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, majesty,
<lb/>And favouring stars—and thou in every point
<lb/>Of native worth art raised o'er other kings,
<lb/>I claim of thee an oath, and thou must keep it,
<lb/>That vengeance on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> shall fill
<lb/>Thy heart, and thou shalt not allay that flame,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="771"/>
<lb/>Regardless of his kinship with thy mother,
<lb/>And heeding not what any one may urge.
<lb/>Thou shalt not be seduced by wealth or power,
<lb/>Howe'er thou be exalted or abased,
<lb/>Nor shalt thou turn aside to treat with him
<lb/>For mace or sword or throne or diadem.
<lb/>I will declare the sanction of thine oath—
<lb/>One binding on thy wisdom and thy soul:
<lb/>Swear by the righteous Judge of sun and moon,
<lb/>By crown, throne, casque, and signet, by the justice
<lb/>Of Farudun and by his precedent,
<lb/>The blood of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, thy life, O <rs type="role">Shah</rs>!
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, and by the favouring stars divine,
<lb/>That thou wilt never turn aside to ill,
<lb/>Wilt ask no arbiter but sword and mace,
<lb/>And rise above thyself in thy resolve.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Whenas the youthful monarch heard the words
<lb/>He turned both face and soul toward the Fire,
<pb n="22"/>
<lb/>And took an oath: <q> By God, the Lord of all,

<lb/>I never will incline toward amity

<milestone unit="vullers" n="772"/>

<lb/>And likewise all the other mighty men.
<lb/>The written oath attested in due form
<lb/>Was put for safety into <persName>Rustam</persName>’s hands.
<lb/>When this was done they called for wine and feast,
<lb/>And held a session of another kind ;

<lb/>Within the hall of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>. <persName>Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>Upon the eighth day bathed, composed himself,
<lb/>Then sought the place of prayer, and, in the presence
<lb/>Of circling heaven’s Lord, adored the Maker.
<lb/>That night until the rising of the sun
<lb/>He cried aloud with eyes fulfilled with tears,
<lb/>And said: <q>O righteous Judge, the only God,
<lb/>The World-lord, the Sustainer, and the Guide!
<lb/>Thus didst deliver me, a hostless boy,
<lb/>Out of the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s breath. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Thou knowest reckless, not afraid to injure;
<lb/>His curse is on the waste and peopled lands;
<lb/>Revenge against him filleth guiltless hearts.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="773"/>
<lb/>He hath poured fire upon these goodly coasts,
<lb/>Hath sifted o'er the brave the dust of woe,
<lb/>Unjustly shed the blood of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>Upon the earth, and rent our souls thereby.
<lb/>The hearts of kings are filled with dread of him;
<lb/>His throne and diadem are this world’s bane.
<lb/>Thou knowest that he is of evil nature,

<lb/>He laid his cheek full oft upon the ground,
<lb/>And uttered praises to the Lord of all.
<lb/>Departing thence he went back to the throne,
<lb/>And thus harangued the exalted paladins :—
<lb/><q>O ye my men of name, ny gallant hearts,

<lb/>But, from the temple of <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>

<lb/>All hearts are filled with blood, all eyes with tears.
<lb/>I am the first whose liver thus he wounded,

<lb/>Who from his heart still heaveth chilly sighs,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="774"/>
<lb/>While men and women groan throughout <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>At massacre and pillage, war and raid.
<lb/>So now if ye are all my trusty friends,

<lb/>I will make ready to avenge my father,
<lb/>And turn this evil from the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>.
<lb/>If ye will, all of you, renew the fight,

<lb/>What say ye then? What answer do ye give?
<lb/>Advise me well. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, ye know,

<lb/>The chiefs prepared to answer and arose
<lb/>With rancour in their hearts. They said: <q>O <rs type="role">Shah</rs>!

<lb/>With matters in this stay the sky revolved

<lb/>Called all the archimages of the realm,
<lb/>And spake to them at large in fitting terms.
<lb/>He closed the door of audience for two sennights,
<lb/>And had the muster-roll compiled afresh.
<lb/>He bade the commissaries to call over
<lb/>The names of great and small, and had them written
<lb/>In solemn form befitting paladins.
<lb/>The kin of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName> five score and ten—

<lb/>Their leader was Zarasp the general,
<lb/>Who used to make their welfare his concern

<lb/>And drum. Gutdarz son of <persName>Kishwad</persName> came next,

<lb/>His sons and grandsons numbered seventy-eight—
<lb/>Brave mountaineers and horsemen of the plain ;
<pb n="25"/>
<lb/>They carried <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard and illumed
<lb/>The throne and fortune of the Kaian race.
<lb/>The seed of <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> were sixty-three,
<lb/>And great men all; their chief was <persName>Gustaham</persName>.
<lb/>The kinsmen of Milad—a hundred horsemen—
<lb/>Had for their chief victorious <persName>Gurgin</persName>.
<lb/>Tawaba’s kindred numbered eighty-five
<lb/>Brave cavaliers, the wardens of the treasure,
<lb/>While Barta was the warden over them,
<lb/>And most illustrious of them all in fight.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="776"/>
<lb/>Next three and thirty scions of <persName>Pashang</persName>,
<lb/>Brave men, who bore the double-headed dart
<lb/>In battle-time, their chieftain was <persName>Rivniz</persName>—
<lb/>A mighty man both valiant and discreet,
<lb/>Who used to go before the drums in war,
<lb/>The warriors' warden, son-in-law to  <persName>Tus</persName>.
<lb/>The kinsmen of <persName>Barzin</persName>, three score and ten
<lb/>In sum, all Lions on the day of battle,
<lb/>Had over them Farhad, himself an Anvil
<lb/>Of steel in fight. Guraza led in person
<lb/>His kinsmen—five score and five warriors.
<lb/>Apart from these, the lords and paladins,
<lb/>The princes and the mighty men of worship,
<lb/>Were more than any archimage could reckon,
<lb/>So many were the chiefs with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and glory!

<lb/>And all must march with joy against <placeName>Turan</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They bent their heads before him to the ground,
<lb/>And all called blessings down upon him, saying :—

<milestone unit="vullers" n="778"/>
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> then bade his treasurer to bring

<lb/>Again <persName>Bizhan</persName> the son of <persName>Giv</persName> arose,

<lb/>Then sat down gladly giving many thanks.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> commanded and the treasurer
<lb/>Brought out ten slave-boys with their girdles on,
<lb/>Ten steeds of rapid pace with golden bridles,
<lb/>And ten veiled maidens in their bravery ;
<lb/>The watchful ruler of the people said :—
<lb/><q>These steeds and all these Beauties are for one
<lb/>Who, when <persName>Tazhav</persName> hath fled, need not possess

<lb/>With reed-like waist and with a pheasant’s gait,
<lb/>A Moon-face, Ispanwi by name, a Jasmine
<lb/>In visage, heart-alluring, breathing musk.
<lb/>Her captor must not strike her with the sword,
<lb/>For swords are not for such a cheek as hers,

<lb/>But noose her waist and take her to his bosom.</q></p>

<milestone unit="vullers" n="779"/>
<lb/>Began to laud the monarch of the world,
<lb/>And supplicate the Maker. The great king
<lb/>Rejoiced in him and spake thus: <q> Famous chief!
<lb/>May paladin like thee ne'er help our foes,
<lb/>Ne'er may thine ardent soul and body part!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then said the world-lord to the treasurer :—
<lb/><q>Bring forth ten golden beakers from the hoard,
<lb/>And let them put pastilles therein; bring also
<lb/>Ten goblets of pure silver brimmed with jewels,
<lb/>One topaz goblet filled with musk, and one
<lb/>Of turquoise, one of lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>With emeralds and carnelians showered therein,
<lb/>Mixed with rose-water and with musk ; ten boy-slaves
<lb/>With belts, and ten fine steeds with golden bridles.
<lb/>These are,</q> he said, <q>for him who, having strength
<lb/>To fight <persName>Tazhav</persName> upon the day of battle,
<lb/>Shall bear his head off from the stricken field,
<lb/>And bring it to the warriors of the host.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Giv</persName> son of <persName>Gudarz</persName> smote on his breast,
<lb/>And undertook to fight that paladin,
<lb/>Whereat they brought those noble slaves and gifts,
<lb/>And set them in array in front of him.
<lb/>He called down many blessings on the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And said: <q> May crown and signet ne'er lack thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> commanded then the treasurer :—
<lb/><q>Set out ten golden trays before the throne,
<lb/>And mix in them dinérs and musk and jewels ;
<lb/>Set too ten Fairy-faced with crowns and girdles,
<lb/>Two hundred beaver-skins, brocade of gold,
<lb/>Ten girdles, and a royal diadem.
<lb/>This is for him,</q> he said, <q>that grudgeth not
<lb/>His labour for the sake of fame and treasure.
<lb/>Let such depart hence to the Kasa rid,
<pb n="29"/>
<lb/>And there salute the soul of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>He will behold a mighty pile of fire-wood,
<lb/>Whose height is greater than ten lassos' length.
<lb/>It is a pile raised by <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Upon the spot whereat he crossed the river.
<lb/>He wished that none should pass there from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="780"/>
<lb/>Turan-ward. Some bold warrior must go hence,
<lb/>And make the Kasa rid a sheet of flame,
<lb/>So that if e'er it be the scene of fight
<lb/>The wood may prove no cover for the foe.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Again <persName>Giv</persName> spake: <q>This is my quarry; mine
<lb/>Shall be the task to set the pile a-blaze.
<lb/>I fear not combat if the foe shall come,
<lb/>But will invite the vultures to a feast.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> bestowed on <persName>Giv</persName> those goods as well,
<lb/>And said to him: <q> Famed chieftain of the host !<ref target="n.29.1"/>
<lb/>May this bright crown ne'er lack thy sword. So be it.
<lb/>Oh! may the Brahman never lack the Idol!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He ordered: <q> Let the treasurer produce
<lb/>Forthwith a hundred divers-hued brocades,</q>
<lb/>Chose from his hoards a hundred lustrous pearls—
<lb/><q>All drops of water frozen,</q> thou wouldst say—
<lb/>And brought out from the women’s bower five hanamaids,
<lb/>Whose heads and tresses were concealed by crowns.
<lb/>He said: <q>This is a present meet for one
<lb/>Whose wisdom is the king of his pure mind—
<lb/>A daring, prudent man and eloquent,
<lb/>Who turneth not from lions in the fight—
<lb/>If he will carry to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>A message, weeping not for dread of him,

<p><lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad held forth his hand,

<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> said: <q>Live for ever! Thou art right.

<p><lb/>The paladin

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<head>How Kat <persName>Khusrau</persName> reviewed the Host</head>
<p>
<lb/>When bright Sol rose above the hills, and when
<lb/>The minstrels tired of song, the kettledrums
<lb/>Clanged at the court-gate and the troops drew up
<lb/>Before the palace. On the elephants
<lb/>They bound the tymbals and the trumpets blared.
<lb/>Upon one elephant they set a throne;
<lb/>That royal Tree bore fruit; the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> came forth,
<lb/>And took his seat, crowned with a jewelled casque.
<lb/>He wore a torque of royal gems and held
<lb/>An ox-head mace. Two earrings, decked with pearls
<lb/>And precious stones, depended from his ears;
<lb/>His bracelets were of jewels set in gold ;
<lb/>His belt was pearls and gold and emeralds.
<pb n="32"/>
<lb/>His elephant with golden bells and bridle
<lb/>Proceeded to the centre of the host.
<lb/>He had with him the ball within the cup;
<lb/>The shouting of the army rose to <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> ;
<lb/>The earth grew black and heaven azure-dim
<lb/>With all the swords and maces, drums and dust;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The sun is in a net,</q>
<lb/>Or <q> Water hath o'erwhelmed the arching sky!</q>
<lb/>The clearest sight could not behold the world,
<lb/>Or gaze upon the sky and stars for spears ;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The billows of the sea
<lb/>Are rising,</q> as the host marched troop by troop.
<lb/>They brought the camp-enclosure from the palace
<lb/>Forth to the plain, and shoutings frayed the skies.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="785"/>
<lb/>The custom was that when that famous <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>Upon his elephant let fall the ball
<lb/>Within the cup, and girt his loins, no place
<lb/>Remained for any one throughout the reali
<lb/>Save at the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s own gate. Such was the token
<lb/>To all his realm of that famed king of chiefs.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> remained upon his elephant
<lb/>On that broad plain to see the troops march past.
<lb/>First to defile before the world’s new lord
<lb/>Was <persName>Fariburz</persName> with golden boots, with mace,
<lb/>And sword. Behind him was his flag sun-blazoned.
<lb/>He rode a chestnut steed, his lasso coiled
<lb/>Was in the saddle-straps. He passed along
<lb/>In pride with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and lustre, his retainers
<lb/>Were buried in their gold and silver trappings.
<lb/>The world-lord blessed him, saying: <q>May the greatness
<lb/>And <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> of heroes ever be thine own,
<lb/>Thy fortune triumph in each enterprise,
<lb/>Thy whole existence be a New Year's Day;
<lb/>May health be thine in all thy goings forth,
<lb/>And no infirmity on thy return.</q>
<pb n="33"/>
<lb/>Behind him was <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>,
<lb/>Whose counsel brought the world prosperity.
<lb/>A lion clutching mace and scimitar
<lb/>Was charged upon the flag that followed him.
<lb/>Upon his left hand marched the brave <persName>Ruhham</persName>,
<lb/>And on his right the noble <persName>Giv</persName>; <persName>Shidush</persName>
<lb/>Behind him bore the banner lion-charged,
<lb/>Which threw a violet lustre on the ground,
<lb/>While thousands of exalted warriors followed,
<lb/>All cavaliers and armed with lengthy lances.
<lb/>Behind <persName>Giv</persName> and accompanied by troops
<lb/>His sable banner came charged with a wolf,
<lb/>While of <persName>Ruhham</persName>, that man of high ambition,
<lb/>The flag rose cloudward tiger-charged. These sons
<lb/>And grandsons of <persName>Gudarz</persName> were seventy-eight
<lb/>In number, and they crowded that broad plain,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="786"/>
<lb/>Each followed by his flag distinct in hue—
<lb/>All valiant men with swords and golden boots.
<lb/><q>The whole world,</q> thou hadst said, <q>is 'neath <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>The chiefs' heads are beneath his scimitar.</q>
<lb/>He called down blessings on the crown and throne
<lb/>As he approached ; the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> returned the blessings
<lb/>On him, on <persName>Giv</persName>, and all his warriors.
<lb/>The next behind <persName>Gudarz</persName> was <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> the vigilant ;
<lb/>His weapon in the battle was a spear,
<lb/>His comrades were a bow and poplar arrows ;
<lb/>And when a shaft went flying from his arm
<lb/>'Twould pierce a rock or anvil to the core.
<lb/>He was attended by a mighty host
<lb/>With maces, scimitars, and rich array.
<lb/>His banner blazoned with a moon waved o'er him,
<lb/>And raised its head resplendent to the clouds,
<lb/>He called down benedictions on the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>Who gloried in him. Next came shrewd Ashkash,
<pb n="34"/>
<lb/>Endowed with prudent heart and ready brain,
<lb/>His troops were from Baluchistan and Kutch,
<lb/>And very rams to fight. No one had seen
<lb/>Their backs in battle or one finger mailless;
<lb/>Their banner was a pard with claws projecting.
<lb/>Ashkash felicitated <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>At large upon the happy turn of fortune.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="787"/>
<lb/>Meanwhile the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> upon his elephant
<lb/>Surveyed the troops, whose ranks stretched out two miles,
<lb/>And in abundant satisfaction blessed
<lb/>His sleepless fortune and his glorious land.
<lb/>Behind Ashkash was well approved Farhad,
<lb/>Who tendered all the troops, and everywhere
<lb/>Was like their foster-father in the fight.
<lb/>He had a banner charged with a gazelle,
<lb/>Whose shadow fell upon him as he rode.
<lb/>His troops were all equipped with <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> swords,
<lb/>With <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> armour and with Sughdian saddles.
<lb/>They all were princely scions of Kubdad,
<lb/>And all were dowered with God’s <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and with justice ;
<lb/>The face of each was like the shining moon,
<lb/>And like the shining sun in battlefield.
<lb/>Farhad beheld the throne’s new occupant,
<lb/>And called down blessings on the youthful <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.
<lb/>Guraza, eldest offspring of Givgan,
<lb/>Came next accompanied by all his kin,
<lb/>A favourite in whom the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> rejoiced.<ref target="n.34.1"/>
<lb/>Upon his saddle was a lasso coiled ;
<lb/>He bore a banner blazoned with a boar ;
<lb/>His troops were warriors and lasso-flingers.
<lb/>These cavaliers and heroes of the plain
<lb/>Saluted many times and then marched past.
<lb/>Behind him Zanga son of Shawaran
<note n="34.1">Reading with P. </note>
<pb n="35"/>
<lb/>Came rushing with his gallant hearts and chieftains.
<lb/>Behind him was his flag charged with an eagle,
<lb/>And as a moving mountain so moved he.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="788"/>
<lb/>Ofttimes he called down blessings on the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>His mien and stature, sword and signet-ring.
<lb/>All that were from the country of Baghdad
<lb/>Were armed with lances and steel swords, and marched
<lb/>Beneath the eagle while their general
<lb/>Himself was seated on an elephant.
<lb/>Behind, him was the valiant Faramarz
<lb/>Of noble stature, <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, and majesty,
<lb/>With tymbals, elephants, and many troops,
<lb/>All eager for the fray, and mighty men
<lb/>Brought from <placeName>Kashmir</placeName>, <placeName>Kabulistan</placeName>, <placeName>Nimruz</placeName>,
<lb/>All noble and the lustre of the world.
<lb/>He had a banner like his valiant sire’s—
<lb/>That <persName>Rustam</persName> who could be surpassed by none—
<lb/>With seven heads, <q> The heads as of a dragon
<lb/>That had escaped from bonds,</q> thou wouldst have said.
<lb/>In favour like a fruitful tree he came,
<lb/>And uttered many a blessing on the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>Who with a heart that joyed at Faramarz
<lb/>Gave him much prudent rede and said to him :—
<lb/><q>The nursling of the elephantine chief

<lb/>Thou art the son of wary-hearted <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Thou art from <persName>Zal</persName>—<persName>Sam</persName>’s son—and Narfman.
<lb/>Now is the land of <placeName>Hindustan</placeName> thine own,

<lb/>So bear thyself that harm may not befall

<milestone unit="vullers" n="789"/>

<lb/>Give, entertain, and never say: <q>To-morrow.</q>
<lb/>How know’st thou what to-morrow will bring forth ?
<lb/>I have bestowed on thee this kingship. Hold it.
<lb/>Make no war anywhere in wantonness,
<lb/>Be not in youth acquisitive of treasure,
<lb/>Aggrieve not any that hath not grieved thee,
<lb/>And trust not thou this treacherous dwelling-place ;
<lb/>'Tis sandarac and ebony by turns.
<lb/>Thy duty is to leave a noble name,
<lb/>And mayst thou never have a sorry heart.
<lb/>For thee and me alike the day will pass,
<lb/>And turning heaven reckon up thy breaths,
<lb/>Thou need’st a happy heart, a body hale;
<lb/>Consider if a third thing is to seek.
<lb/>May He who made the world be gracious to thee,
<lb/>And smoke fill thy foes' hearts.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The chief, on hearing
<lb/>The words of this new master of the world,
<lb/>Dismounted from his fleet steed, and invoked
<lb/>Full many a blessing on the young <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, saying :—
<lb/><q>Mayst thou wax even as the new moon waxeth.</q>
<lb/>He kissed the ground and, having done obeisance,
<lb/>Turned and departed on his longsome journey,
<lb/>While matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>, with his brain distraught
<lb/>At losing Fardmarz, accompanied
<milestone unit="vullers" n="790"/>
<lb/>His son two leagues, instructing him withal
<lb/>In warfare, feast, and wisdom, wishing him
<milestone unit="vullers" n="791"/>
<lb/>A life of joy; then sadly turned and went
<lb/>Back from the desert to the tent-enclosure.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> got off his lusty elephant,
<lb/>And, mounting on a rapid-footed steed,
<lb/>Withdrew in state to his pavilion,
<lb/>With aching heart and deeply pondering.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> had returned the wine was brought ;
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> filled up a mighty bowl, and said :—
<lb/><q>Mirth as thy mate sufficeth, and no sage

<lb/>Will name to-morrow. Where are <persName>Tur</persName> and <persName>Salm</persName>
<lb/>And Farfdin? All lost and one with dust!

<lb/>Then shall we see o'er whom the turning sky
<lb/>Will stretch its hand in love in this campaign.
<lb/>And yet what profit is our toil to us
<lb/>Since from the first what is to be will be ?
<lb/>We shall be quit alike of good and ill;

<lb/>Still by the aid of Him who made us all

<lb/>The banner o'er them bore an elephant,
<lb/>Its golden staff-head rising to the clouds.
<lb/>They went together, like a darksome mountain,
<lb/>And sun and moon ceased shining. When they came
<lb/>With flags and helms in haste before the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>He bade the chieftain <persName>Tus</persName> present to him
<lb/>The warriors of distinction in the host,
<lb/>And thus addressed them: <q><persName>Tus</persName> is chief; he hath
<lb/>The flag of <persName>Kawa</persName>; do as he commandeth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then in their sight he gave his signet-ring
<lb/>To <persName>Tus</persName>, and said: <q>He is your chief and leader.</q>
<lb/>To <persName>Tus</persName> himself he said: <q>Be true to me,
<lb/>And mark mine institutions and commands:
<lb/>No one must be molested on the march,
<lb/>Such is the custom of my crown and throne.

<lb/>Upon a mountain steep and hard to reach.
<lb/>He is a brave and warlike cavalier,
<lb/>Great through his native worth and famed of person,
<lb/>And therefore thou must take the desert-road :
<lb/>It is not well to touch the claws of lions.</q>
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> answered : <q>In thy counsels is success,
<lb/>By that way which thou biddest will I go,
<lb/>For good alone must come of thy behest.</q>
<lb/>He then departed quickly, and the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>Returned with loyal <persName>Rustam</persName> to the throne,
<lb/>Where sitting with that elephantine hero,
<lb/>The lords, archmages, and the stainless princes,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="795"/>
<lb/>He spake at large about <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>His own heart’s anguish and his father’s wrongs.
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> for his part with all his warriors
<lb/>Came to a place where two roads met; the one
<lb/>Went through a desert dry and waterless,
<lb/>The other by Kalat and toward Charam.
<lb/>The elephants and kettledrums were halted
<lb/>Till <persName>Tus</persName> the general should come up, that so
<lb/>The host might take the road that pleased him best.
<lb/>When <persName>Tus</persName> had at his leisure reached the chiefs
<lb/>He spake about the waterless, hot road ;
<lb/>Then to <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q> Although this arid waste
<lb/>Yield ambergris for dust and musk for soil,
<lb/>Still on a long and toilsome march we need
<lb/>Repose and water. Our best route will be
<lb/>Kalat, Charam, encamping at Mayam,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="796"/>
<lb/>With streams and fertile country on both sides:
<lb/>Why choose a desert and its miseries ?
<lb/>I went along that way in former times,
<lb/>When <persName>Gazhdaham</persName> was leader of the host,
<lb/>And never saw so troublesome a road
<lb/>Although the ups and downs are few enough.
<lb/>'Tis best to march along the other route,
<lb/>And measure not the desert and its leagues.</q>
<pb n="41"/>
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> replied: <q> The noble <rs type="role">Shah</rs> made thee
<lb/>Commander of this host; lead as he bade;
<lb/>Make not the troops' march grievous. They should not
<lb/>By disobedience to the great king’s orders
<lb/>Be injured thus.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> said: <q>O famous warrior!
<lb/>Think not such things; this will not vex the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And therefore need not be a grief to thee.</q>
<lb/>He spake and bade the army to proceed,
<lb/>And march toward Kalat and to Charam;
<lb/>And, since <persName>Khusrau</persName>’s commands he minded not,
<lb/>See what a Tempest proved at last his lot!</p></div>

<p>

<lb/>By dust raised by the feet of elephants

<lb/>Thy brother’s army marcheth from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>Against <placeName>Turan</placeName> for vengeance, purposing
<lb/>To take the road that leadeth to Kalat.
<lb/>I know not where their battlefield will be.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The inexperienced youth on hearing this
<lb/>Grew very sore of heart and dark of soul.
<lb/>He came down from the hold, unbarred the gate,
<lb/>And going forth surveyed the lofty mountain.
<lb/>At his command they brought in all the camels,
<lb/>The sheep, and horses; none remained on waste
<lb/>Or hill; he drove them all toward <persName>Mount</persName> Sapad
<lb/>And toward Ambuh, returned, secured the gate,
<lb/>And mounted on a rapid-footed steed.
<lb/>When from Mayam the sound of drums arose,
<lb/>And from Charam dust-clouds like ebony,
<pb n="42"/>
<lb/>Jarira, gazing from the castle-roof,
<lb/>Felt her heart throb in terror of that host.
<lb/>To her, his mother, came the young <persName>Farud</persName>,
<lb/>And said: <q>O chief of ladies! from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>A host hath come with elephants and tymbals,
<lb/>And <persName>Tus</persName> the general is in command.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="798"/>
<lb/>What sayest thou? What is the course to take?
<lb/>We must prevent him from attacking us.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Jarira said to him: <q>O warrior!
<lb/>Be all thy days as fortunate as this!
<lb/>Thy brother is the new <rs type="role">Shah</rs> of <placeName>Iran</placeName>:
<lb/>A world-lord shrewd is Kai Kbusrau, and he
<lb/>Well knoweth both thy name and native worth.
<lb/>One father’s blood and bone are in you both,
<lb/>And <persName>Siyawush</persName> was peerless in the world.
<lb/>Well may the age applaud him! At the outset
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> gave me to him; he would not else
<lb/>Have sought a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> spouse. Thus thy descent
<lb/>On both sides is illustrious and royal.
<lb/>Now, since thy brother seeketh to avenge,
<lb/>And vindicate, the soul of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>Thou shouldst be foremost in the race for vengeance,
<lb/>In making ready and exacting it.
<lb/>Don Ruiman mail and go with raging heart,

<lb/>For, since he seeketh vengeance on your grandsire,
<lb/>Thy part should be revenge, not policy,
<lb/>In that this grief may well make leopards wail,
<lb/>And crocodiles come groaning from the river.
<lb/>The birds too and the fishes in the water
<lb/>Call curses down upon <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>For in the whole world not one sovereign
<lb/>That girdeth girdle is like <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>In prowess, manhood, fortune, and high birth,

<lb/>Thou art the son of that world-famous chief,

<lb/>Art of the Kaian seed and look’st it too!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="799"/>
<lb/>Thou must gird up thy loins then to avenge

<lb/>See who the leader is of yonder host,

<lb/>And set upon the tables wine and gifts
<lb/>Of scimitars, of helmets, of horse-armour,
<lb/>Of coats of mail, and <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> swords. Thy brother

<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> said: <q> Which of them must I address

<lb/>These men so haughty on the day of battle,
<lb/>Because I know not one of them by name ?
<lb/>How shall I send them greeting and a message ?</q>
<lb/>Jarira answered: <q>In the dust afar

<head>How Farid and Tukhdr went to view the Host</head>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Tukhar</persName> departed with <persName>Farud</persName>—a youth
<lb/>Whom fortune had abandoned. Whensoever
<lb/>The sky above us is untowardly
<lb/>No gentleness or rage availeth thee.
<lb/>They chose the summit of a lofty mountain,
<lb/>Commanding all the army of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>And marvelled at the troops and their equipment.
<lb/>The youth said to his confidant <persName>Tukhar</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Conceal not aught of what I ask of thee.
<lb/>Tell me the names of all that thou beholdest—
<lb/>The man of rank, the bearer of the flag,
<lb/>The lord of partisan and golden boot—
<lb/>All whom thou recognisest of <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q>
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host defiled between two mountains,
<lb/>And what with golden helm and golden shield,
<lb/>With golden ax and golden partisan,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q> No gold is left unmined,
<lb/>A cloud hath risen and rained jewelry !</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="801"/>

<lb/>The roar of kettledrums along the pass
<lb/>Affrayed the vultures as they flew o'erhead,
<lb/>While thirty thousand sword and buckler men
<lb/>Marched bravely on in all points dight for war.
<lb/>Now when <persName>Tukhar</persName> had scanned the host, the prince
<lb/>Began to question him. That expert answered :—
<lb/><q>I will clear up what is obscure to thee:
<lb/>Know that yon flag charged with an elephant,
<pb n="45"/>
<lb/>Those horsemen, and those blue steel scimitars,
<lb/>Belong to noble <persName>Tus</persName> the general—
<lb/>A bad opponent when he seeketh vengeance.
<lb/>Behind him is another standard bearing
<lb/>A blazing sun: 'tis that of <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>Son of <persName>Kaus</persName>, a general, thine uncle,
<lb/>A man of <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and purpose. Next to him
<lb/>There is a mighty flag, its charge a moon,
<lb/>With many valiant warriors. The chief
<lb/>Call <persName>Gustaham</persName> the son of <persName>Gazhdaham</persName>,
<lb/>Whom no two-headed dart or club affrayeth.
<lb/>Next yon tall flag charged with an onager,
<lb/>Encompassed by a band of warriors,
<lb/>Is over Zanga son of Shawaran,
<lb/>Whose troops are mighty men. The flag behind
<lb/>Thou hath a moon on red, with musk-black Iranges,
<lb/>Belongeth to <persName>Giv</persName>’s son <persName>Bizhan</persName> who spurteth
<lb/>Blood to the sky. The flag charged with a tiger—
<lb/>One that would make a mighty lion burst,
<lb/>And, thou wouldst say, is leaping from its field—
<lb/>Is borne by brave <persName>Shidush</persName>, while that behind him,
<lb/>Whose blazon is a wild boar, <q>One to bring,</q>
<lb/>As that wouldst say, <q>the heavens to the shears,</q>
<lb/>Pertaineth to a brave chief hight Guraza,
<lb/>Who counteth it but sport to fight a lion.
<lb/>The next flag blazoned with a buffalo,
<lb/>With cavaliers behind and chiefs in front,
<lb/>Is famed Farhad’s, the choicest of the chiefs:
<lb/>Thou wouldest say: <q>His stature is sky-high.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="802"/>
<lb/>The banner with a wolf for its device
<lb/>Betokeneth the valiant chieftain <persName>Giv</persName>.
<lb/>The banner with the lion wrought in gold
<lb/>Is floating o'er <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>.
<lb/>The streaming standard blazoned with a pard
<lb/>Precedeth proud, imperious <persName>Rivniz</persName>.
<lb/>The banner that is charged with a gazelle
<pb n="46"/>
<lb/>Belongeth to Nastuh son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>And to his troops; that with the mountain-sheep
<lb/>Pertaineth to another son—<persName>Bahram</persName>.
<lb/>They all are lion-men—brave cavaliers ;
<lb/>To name each one were tedious.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus he told
<lb/>The blazons of the chiefs to prince Fardd,
<lb/>Who viewed all, great and small. His heart grew glad,
<lb/>His cheek flushed,<ref target="n.46.1"/> and he spake thus to <persName>Tukhar</persName> :—
<lb/><q>We shall take vengeance for my sire with ease !
<lb/>I will not leave in <placeName>Chin</placeName> or in Machin
<lb/>A cavalier, when battling for revenge,

<p><lb/>Now when the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> had deseried
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> upon the mountain with <persName>Tukhar</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> the commander was incensed, and caused

<milestone unit="vullers" n="803"/>
<lb/><q>We need an enterprising cavalier
<lb/>To hasten to the mountain-top to learn
<lb/>Who these two warriors are and wherefore there.
<lb/>If they be ours let him bestow on them
<lb/>Two hundred lashes on their heads, if foes
<lb/>Bind them and drag them hither faces downward ;
<lb/>If they be slain still let him drag them hither
<lb/>Along the dust and have no fear of any,
<lb/>While if they shall prove spies, who want to take
<lb/>The number of our forces secretly,
<lb/>Let him cleave both asunder on the spot,
<lb/>Then fling them down the mountain and return ;
<lb/>But if a countless host be ambushed there,
<lb/>Whereof a straggling few have shown themselves,
<lb/>Let him return and give the intelligence
<lb/>To us forthwith, and we will drive them thence.</q>

<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> returning said to <persName>Tus</persName>: <q>May wisdom
<lb/>And thy pure soul be mates! This is <persName>Farud</persName>,
<lb/>The son of guiltless, murdered <persName>Siyawush</persName>!
<lb/>He showed to me the mark which all the race
<lb/>Inherit from <persName>Kaus</persName> and <persName>Kai Kubad</persName>.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="808"/>
<lb/>The overbearing general replied :—
<lb/><q>The host, the trumpets, and the drums are mine.
<lb/>My words to thee were: <q> Bring the man to me,
<lb/>Ask him no questions,</q> If he be a king
<lb/>Who then am_I, and wherefore am I here
<lb/>With this array? A man of <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> race,
<lb/>Like some black raven on the mountain there,
<lb/>Is hindering the progress of the troops!
<lb/>Among the froward offspring of <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>I can see naught but mischief to the host.
<lb/>Thou wast afraid of one unskilful horseman !
<lb/>It was no savage Lion on the height.
<lb/>He. saw our host, and duped thee. Thou hast gone
<lb/>Both up and down for naught!</q> Then to the chiefs :—
<lb/><q>O men of name and slayers of the foe!
<lb/>I need some noble and aspiring man
<lb/>To face the height and <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>, to behead him,
<lb/>And bring his head to me before the host.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Rivniz</persName> girt up his loins for that encounter,
<lb/>Which cost his life. Then said <persName>Bahram</persName> to <persName>Tus</persName> :—
<lb/><q>O paladin! stain not thy soul so rashly.
<lb/>Revere the Ruler of the sun and moon:
<lb/>Respect the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, for yonder is his kinsman—
<lb/>A famous horseman and a warrior;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="809"/>
<pb n="52"/>
<lb/>And even if a hundred cavaliers
<lb/>Should go against him to the mountain-top
<lb/>They would not ’scape his clutches with their lives:
<lb/>Thou wilt but bring glad hearts to misery.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This angered <persName>Tus</persName>, who would not be advised,
<lb/>But bade some chiefs to hasten to the mountain,
<lb/>And many valiant men rushed forth and raised
<lb/>Their heads to make an onslaught on Fardd,
<lb/>But <q> Hold not,</q> thus spake brave <persName>Bahram</persName> to them,
<lb/><q>This matter lightly; he on yonder height
<lb/>Is of <persName>Khusrau</persName>’s own kin, one hair of whom
<lb/>Is better than a hundred paladins.
<lb/>He that ne'er saw the face of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>Will find repose in gazing on his son.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now when <persName>Bahram</persName> told of <persName>Farud</persName> the men
<lb/>That had set forth retraced their steps again.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<head>How <persName>Rivniz</persName> was slain by <persName>Farud</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>Then for the second time the son-in-law
<lb/>Of <persName>Tus</persName> came forth—the laughing-stock of heaven—
<lb/>And left the road that leadeth to Charam
<lb/>For <persName>Mount</persName> Sapad, his fierce heart set on outrage.
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> descried him from the mountain-top,
<lb/>And, drawing from its case his royal bow,
<lb/>Said to <persName>Tukhar</persName> the veteran: <q><persName>Tus</persName> hath spurned
<lb/>The message, for a horseman not <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>Hath come! My heart is confident but heavy.
<lb/>See if thou canst remember who he is.
<lb/>Why is he clad in mail from head to foot ?</q>
<lb/><persName>Tukhar</persName> replied: <q> A valiant cavalier,
<lb/><persName>Rivniz</persName> by name. He is an only son
<lb/>With forty sisters like the jocund spring.
<lb/>He is unscrupulous, sly, plausible,
<pb n="53"/>
<lb/>Accomplished, young, and son-in-law to  <persName>Tus</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Farud</persName> returned: <q>Such talk is not for war-time.
<lb/>If he approach for combat I will send him
<lb/>To sleep upon his sisters' skirts. If merely
<lb/>Mine arrow make him feel its wind in passing,
<lb/>And he surviveth, hold me not a man.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="810"/>
<lb/>Which shall mine arrow slay—the horse or rider ?
<lb/>How sayest thou, O veteran <persName>Tukhar</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tukhar</persName> replied: <q> The time for strife hath come.<ref target="n.53.1"/>
<lb/>Loose at the man; perchance the heart of <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>May be perturbed for him. <persName>Tus</persName> knoweth not
<lb/>Thy resolution for thou soughtest peace ;
<lb/>If he attacketh thee in wantonness
<lb/>He will but bring disgrace upon thy brother.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When sword in hand <persName>Rivniz</persName> drew nigh, <persName>Farud</persName>
<lb/>Strung his curved bow, shot down a poplar shait,
<lb/>And pinned the <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs> helmet to the head
<lb/>Of him that came. He fell. His fleet steed left him.
<lb/><persName>Rivniz</persName> came headlong to the dust. When  <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>The general, beheld this from Mayam
<lb/>The mountain disappeared before his eyes!
<lb/>Now wisdom hath a saw in this regard :—
<lb/><q>Man’s evil nature is its own reward.</q></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<head>How Zardsp was slain by <persName>Farud</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName> said to Zarasp: <q>Let thy heart flame
<lb/>As 'twere <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>, don horsemen’s armour,
<lb/>And take good heed of thine own life and person.
<lb/>Thou mayst perchance avenge this noble chief,
<lb/>Or if not I myself will seek for vengeance.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Zarasp departed and assumed his helm.
<lb/>With vengeful heart and windy pate he went
<note n="53.1">Inserted from C.</note>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="811"/>
<pb n="54"/>
<lb/>Toward <persName>Mount</persName> Sapad, like some fierce, vengeful lion,
<lb/>And scaled the mountain, with uplifted head,
<lb/>Loud shouts, fierce gestures, and impetuous heart.
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName>, that raging Lion, told <persName>Tukhar</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Another challenger is on his way ;
<lb/>See now who this <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> horseman is
<lb/>That cometh galloping upon the mountain.</q>
<lb/><persName>Tukhar</persName> declared at once: <q>It is the son
<lb/>Of <persName>Tus</persName>, by name Zarasp, who wheeleth not
<lb/>His charger from an elephant of war.
<lb/>His sister was the consort of <persName>Rivniz</persName>.
<lb/>This atheling hath come for vengeance too!
<lb/>As soon as he can see thine arm and casque
<lb/>Let loose a poplar shaft that he may come
<lb/>Down from his charger headlong to the dust.
<lb/>Sure am I that the heart of <persName>Tus</persName> will be
<lb/>As 'twere a leaf in winter at his death,
<lb/>And that insensate chief will understand
<lb/>That we are not here to be sport for him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When in the sight of all the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host
<lb/>Zarasp drew near upon the mountain-top,
<lb/>The valorous <persName>Farud</persName> urged on his charger,
<lb/>Shot at Zarasp and pinned him through the mail
<lb/>And loins against the saddle. His spirit flamed

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<head>How <persName>Tus</persName> fought with <persName>Farud</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>A shout ascended from the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host,
<lb/>And all the warriors put on their helms.
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> with a full heart and with weeping eyes
<lb/>Donned his cuirass in haste. He greatly mourned
<lb/>Those gallant chiefs and trembled like a leaf.
<pb n="55"/>
<lb/>He mounted on his saddle and appeared
<lb/>As 'twere the mountain-mass that men up pile
<lb/>Upon the back of lusty elephants,
<lb/>And turned his charger’s reins toward <persName>Farud</persName>
<lb/>With heart revengeful and with head a-fume.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="812"/>
<lb/><persName>Tukhar</persName> the spokesman said: <q> A Mountain cometh
<lb/>In fury toward the height. 'Tis <persName>Tus</persName> the chief!
<lb/>Contend not with the veteran Crocodile.
<lb/>Secure thee in the hold and wait on fortune.
<lb/>Expect no merrymake since thou hast slain
<lb/>Alike his son and son-in-law in battle.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The young <persName>Farud</persName>, wroth with <persName>Tukhar</persName>, replied :—
<lb/><q>When war and strife confront us what care I
<lb/>For <persName>Tus</persName> or elephant or mighty lion,
<lb/>For warrior-leopard or for tiger? These
<lb/>But give a man the heart to fight, and serve not
<lb/>To scatter earth upon the raging fire.</q>
<lb/>Then said <persName>Tukhar</persName> the much-experienced: <q> Kings
<lb/>Despise not counsel. Iron though thou be,
<lb/>And able to uproot a mount of flint,
<lb/>Yet art thou but a single cavalier ;
<lb/>And thirty thousand warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>Will come against thee to the mountain-top.
<lb/>No strong-hold will be left here, stone or dust:
<lb/>They will sweep all away, and furthermore
<lb/>If evil by this means shall come to <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>His downfall will cause sorrow to <persName>Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>And so defeat the vengeance for thy sire—
<lb/>A breach which nevermore will be repaired.
<lb/>Why combat with a Lion in thy rage ?
<lb/>Go to the hold and fight not foolishly.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This, which he should have spoken at the first,
<lb/>He left unsaid till then; so to <persName>Farud</persName>
<lb/>All through this worthless, foolish minister
<lb/>Resulted battle and the loss of life.
<lb/>The youth had eighty moon-faced female slaves
<pb n="56"/>
<lb/>At home who stood upon the roof to watch him,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="813"/>
<lb/>And babbled ceaselessly. He could not brook
<lb/>The thought of a retreat before their eyes,
<lb/>But raised his reins and rushing on like wind
<lb/>Set to his string another poplar shaft ;
<lb/>But first <persName>Tukhar</persName> said: <q>If thou meanest fight,
<lb/>The best for thee, or else thou mayest not conquer
<lb/>The noble  <persName>Tus</persName>, will be to overthrow
<lb/>His steed, for monarchs do not war afoot,
<lb/>However much they may be put to it;
<lb/>Besides one wooden arrow from a bow
<lb/>Will never set a period to his life,
<lb/>And when the general shall reach the summit
<lb/>His warriors will follow, and thou hast not
<lb/>The power to oppose; thou hast not looked
<lb/>His arrows in the face.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The youth attended
<lb/>To what <persName>Tukhar</persName> said, strung his bow, and shot.
<lb/>The poplar arrow struck the general’s steed—
<lb/>A bow-shot worthy of a cavalier—
<lb/>The charger came down headlong and expired
<lb/>While <persName>Tus</persName> both raged and blustered. He returned
<lb/>To camp, his buckler hanging from his neck,
<lb/>On foot, all dusty, and distraught in mind,
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> the while with gibes pursuing him :—
<lb/><q>What ailed the noble paladin, and how
<lb/>Will he proceed amid the ranks of war
<lb/>Who cannot fight a single horseman here?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The women-slaves began to laugh, and sent
<lb/>Their peals of laughter through the sky. They cried :—
<lb/><q>The old man staggereth down the mountain-slope,
<lb/>Affrighted at the arrows of a youth !</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName>Tus</persName> descended from the height the chiefs,
<lb/>Full of concern, approached him, did obeisance,
<lb/>And said: <q>O famous paladin of earth!
<lb/>What can be better than thy safe return ?
<pb n="57"/>
<lb/>We have no cause to bathe our cheeks in tears.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The noble <persName>Giv</persName> was grievously distressed
<lb/>Because the valiant general had come back
<milestone unit="vullers" n="814"/>
<lb/>Afoot, and said: <q>This youth exceedeth bounds
<lb/>In turning thus our chieftains' faces pale!
<lb/>What though he be a king and weareth earrings,
<lb/>Is he to flout so great a host as this ?
<lb/>It is not right that we should acquiesce
<lb/>In his pretensions thus. If <persName>Tus</persName> displayed
<lb/>Some hastiness, <persName>Farud</persName> hath filled the world
<lb/>With tumult. We would die for <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>But we must not forget this injury.
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> hath given to the winds Zarasp,
<lb/>That noble cavalier sprung from <persName>Naudar</persName>!
<lb/>The body of <persName>Rivniz</persName> is drowned in blood!
<lb/>What further shame is ours? <persName>Farud</persName>, though he
<lb/><persName>Jamshid</persName>’s own son, Kubdd’s own marrow, be,
<lb/>Hath made a new departure witlessly.</q></p></div>

<p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> spake, armed in hot haste, and came forth proudly
<lb/>Like wild sheep on the mountain. Seeing him
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> heaved from his breast a chilly sigh,
<lb/>And said: <q>This warrior-host discerneth not
<lb/>Between uphill and down! Each combatant
<lb/>Is braver than the last—the crown of hosts—
<lb/>But wit is lacking in their paladin ;
<lb/>A witless head is like a soulless body.
<lb/>I fear me they will fail in their revenge
<lb/>Unless <persName>Khusrau</persName> himself invade <placeName>Turan</placeName>;
<lb/>Then back to back will we avenge our sire,
<lb/>And haply get our foes within our clutches.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="815"/>
<lb/>Now tell me who this noble horseman is,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="816"/>
<pb n="58"/>
<lb/>Whose hand and brand will shortly ask for tears?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thereat <persName>Tukhar</persName> glanced at the plain below,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>It is the raging <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>,
<lb/>Whose neezings make birds topple from the air,
<lb/>Who put <persName>Piran</persName> thy grandsire’s hands in bonds,
<lb/>And brake two <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> hosts!<ref target="n.58.1"/> He hath unfathered
<lb/>Full many a little child. His foot hath been
<lb/>On many a river, mount, and wilderness.
<lb/>Full many a father too hath he unsonned,
<lb/>And treadeth underfoot the lion’s neck.
<lb/>'Twas he that bare thy brother to <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>And crossed <placeName>Jihun</placeName> although he saw no boat.<ref target="n.58.2"/>
<lb/>They call him <persName>Giv</persName>—a very Elephant
<lb/>Or river <placeName>Nile</placeName> upon the day of battle.
<lb/>When thou shalt set thy thumbstall to the bow-string
<lb/>Thy poplar arrow will not pierce his mail,
<lb/>Because he weareth that of <persName>Siyawush</persName> ;<ref target="n.58.3"/>
<lb/>So draw thy bow and let the arrow fly
<lb/>Against his steed. The great beast may be wounded,
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName> the rider may return afoot
<lb/>With shield on neck as did their general.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The brave prince bent his bow until the top
<lb/>Was at his shoulder, shot, and struck <persName>Giv</persName>’s charger
<lb/>Upon the breast. <persName>Giv</persName> came down and retreated.
<lb/>Then from the battlements of <persName>Mount</persName> Sapad
<lb/>A shout rose. <persName>Giv</persName>’s brain shrank before the jeers,
<lb/>But all the mighty men approached him, saying :—
<lb/><q>Praise be to God, exalted warrior !
<lb/>Because the horse is hurt and thou art not,
<lb/>Nor art thou captured but can’st go again.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> the warrior came to <persName>Giv</persName> like wind,
<lb/>And uttered words most unacceptable :— <ref target="n.58.4"/>

<lb/>Why did a single horseman see thy back ?
<lb/>Thy hand was wont to be the heart of fight,
<lb/>But now because a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> shot thy steed
<lb/>Thou wentest reeling like a drunken man!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> answered saying: <q>Since my horse was wounded
<lb/>I should have forfeited my life to him
<lb/>Immediately.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He spake in savage tones,
<lb/>Which when <persName>Bizhan</persName> perceived he showed his back,
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName> in fury at his levity
<lb/>Lashed at <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s head with a riding-whip,
<lb/>And said: <q>Did no one ever teach thee this—
<lb/>That circumspection is required in war ?
<lb/>Thou hast no wisdom, providence, or brains,
<lb/>And may he cease to be that nurtured thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> was pained because his sire was wroth,
<lb/>And swore an oath before the Almighty Judge :—
<lb/><q>I will not take the saddle off my steed
<lb/>Until I have avenged Zarisp or perished.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Departing with a heart oppressed by care,
<lb/>And head all vengeance, unto <persName>Gustaham</persName>
<lb/>He spake thus: <q>Let me have a steed of thine—
<lb/>A handy one, such as will climb with ease
<lb/>The mountain-side—so that I may assume
<lb/>My mail that one of us may seem a man.
<lb/>A <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> hath ascended to the heights,
<lb/>So as to draw the eyes of all the host,
<lb/>And I desire to go and fight with him
<lb/>Because my soul is darkened by his deeds.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Gustaham</persName>: <q> This is not well. Climb not
<lb/>The height so rashly! When we have to march
<lb/>The world will be all ups and downs and waste.
<lb/>Now of my horses fit to carry armour
<lb/>I have but two remaining, and if he
<milestone unit="vullers" n="817"/>
<lb/>Destroy one I shall not obtain another
<lb/>To take its place in action, strength, and size.
<pb n="60"/>
<lb/>Zarasp—a world-lord—with <persName>Rivniz</persName>, and <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>Who holdeth all the world of no account,
<lb/>And thine own sire, that hunter of fierce lions,
<lb/>Who recketh not how heaven’s wheel may turn,
<lb/>Have all retreated from him with sore hearts;
<lb/>None made a fight against that <persName>Mount</persName> of Flint.
<lb/>Would that we had a vulture’s wings or eagle's,
<lb/>For none will get inside the hold afoot !</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> replied to him: <q> Break not my heart,
<lb/>Break not mine arms and shoulders too just now,
<lb/>For I have sworn a great oath by the moon,
<lb/>The world’s Judge, and the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s own diadem,
<lb/>That if I am not slain I will not ride
<lb/>Back from the mountain but avenge Zarasp.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Gustaham</persName> replied: <q> This is not good,
<lb/>For wisdom doth not recognise such fierceness.</q>
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> responded: <q>I will go afoot,
<lb/>And so avenge Zarasp: I need no horse.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then answered <persName>Gustaham</persName>: <q>I would not have
<lb/>A single hair to perish from thy head ;
<lb/>And if I had a hundred thousand steeds,
<lb/>Whose manes and tails were full of royal gems,
<lb/>I would not keep them or my treasure, life,
<lb/>Or iron mace or falchion back from thee.
<lb/>Go thou, inspect my horses each in turn,
<lb/>And take whichever of them thou preferrest.
<lb/>Bid that be saddled. If "tis slain so be it,</q></p>
<p><lb/>He had one charger that was like a wolf,
<lb/>Long in the barrel, tall, and spirited :
<lb/>They mailed it for the brave, young atheling.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, mindful of <persName>Farud</persName>’s deeds, fumed at heart
<lb/>Thereat, then sent and summoned <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/>And uttered many a saw concerning youth.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="818"/>
<lb/>He sent <persName>Bizhan</persName> the mail of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,

<lb/>Against the steed, and break not the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s heart.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> too hath the mail, and <persName>Giv</persName> hath linked
<lb/>The gorget of the helm, of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>Thereto. These neither double-headed dart

<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>It had no life.</q> It fell,

<lb/>He made toward the summit, sword in hand,
<lb/>And shouted: <q>O thou valiant cavalier!
<lb/>Remain and see now how a Lion fighteth,
<lb/>And realise how heroes though unhorsed
<lb/>Will still advance to battle with the sword.
<lb/>Thou shalt behold it if thou wilt await me,
<lb/>For thou shalt never think of fighting more.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="819"/>
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> above was angered too because
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> withdrew not, and again that Lion
<lb/>Discharged a shaft. Bfzhan the brave held up
<pb n="62"/>
<lb/>His shield above his head. The arrow pierced
<lb/>The shield but missed the mail. Bfzhan sped on,
<lb/>And, when he reached the summit, drew his sword.
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> the noble turned away from him;
<lb/>The ramparts rang with cries. <persName>Bizhan</persName> pursued
<lb/>Apace, sharp sword in hand, and gashed the bards

<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> howbeit gained the castle-gate,

<lb/>She dreamed that from the lofty castle rose
<lb/>A flame in front of him she loved so well,
<lb/>Illuming <persName>Mount</persName> Sapad and burning all
<lb/>The castle and the women-slaves. She woke
<lb/>In pain, her soul in anguish and dismay,
<lb/>Went out upon the wall and looking round
<lb/>Saw all the mountain filled with mail and spears.
<lb/>Her cheek flushed up and fuming at the heart
<lb/>She hastened to <persName>Farud</persName>, and cried to him :—
<lb/><q>Awake from slumber, O my son! the stars
<lb/>Are bringing down disaster on our heads!
<lb/>The mountain is all foes, the castle-gate
<lb/>All spears and mail!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He said: <q> Why such to-do /
<lb/>If life is o'er for me, and thou canst count not
<lb/>On further respite for me, mine own sire
<lb/>Was slain in youth, my life is wrecked like his.
<lb/>Gurwi's hand put a period to his days,
<lb/>And now <persName>Bizhan</persName> is eager for my death;
<lb/>Yet will I struggle, perish wretchedly,
<lb/>And not ask quarter of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He gave out mail and maces to the troops,
<lb/>He placed a splendid helm upon his head,
<lb/>Aud with a Riuman breastplate girt about him
<lb/>Came with a royal bow grasped in his hand.
<lb/>Now when the shining sun displayed its face,
<lb/>And proudly mounted to the vault of heaven,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="821"/>
<lb/>The war-cries of the chieftains rose on all sides,
<lb/>While massive maces whirled amid the din
<lb/>Of clarions, tymbals, pipes, and <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bells.
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName> descended from the castle-ram parts
<lb/>With all his gallant <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>. Through the dust
<lb/>Raised by the horsemen, and the feathered shafts,
<lb/>The mountain-top was like a sea of pitch.
<pb n="64"/>
<lb/>There was no level ground or room to fight;
<lb/>The rocks and stones played havoc with the steeds,
<lb/>While shouts ascended as the armies strove.
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> ready armed for battle, grasping shield
<lb/>And trenchant falchion, led the way in person,
<lb/>Escorted by the chieftains of the host
<lb/>Afoot. Thus they attacked till noon was high,
<lb/>And then the troops of brave <persName>Farud</persName> were thinned,
<lb/>The hills and valleys had been filled with slain,
<lb/>The youth’s good fortune had abandoned him.
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> marvelled at him, none had seen
<lb/>So fierce a Lion, but as battle pressed him
<lb/>He saw his fortune adverse; of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>
<lb/>No cavalier remained with him; he fought
<milestone unit="vullers" n="822"/>

<lb/>Alone; he turned and fled down toward the hold.
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> sought with <persName>Bizhan</persName> to intercept him:
<lb/>They charged him from above and from below.
<lb/>When on the lower ground <persName>Bizhan</persName> appeared,
<lb/>With stirrups firmly pressed and reins held loose,
<lb/>The youth espied the helm, drew out his mace,
<lb/>And went like some fierce lion at his foe,
<lb/>Not knowing what the vaulted sky decreed.
<lb/>He thought to strike <persName>Bizhan</persName> upon the head,
<lb/>And smash both head and helmet with one buffet.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> was staggered by the young man’s stroke,
<lb/>And lost both sense and power. <persName>Ruhham</persName> behind
<lb/>Saw this and shouted, clutched his <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword,
<lb/>And struck the lion-man upon the shoulder ;
<lb/>His hand fell useless. Wounded he cried out,
<lb/>And urged his steed which, as he neared the hold,
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> came up and houghed. <persName>Farud</persName> himself
<lb/>Afoot with certain of his followers,
<lb/>Thus stricken in the battles of the brave,
<lb/>Reached and secured with speed the castle-gate.
<lb/>Woe for the heart and name of brave <persName>Farud</persName>!
<lb/>His mother and the slaves drew near, embraced him,
<pb n="65"/>
<lb/>And sadly laid him on his ivory throne:
<lb/>His day, his season for the crown, were over.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="823"/>
<lb/>His mother and the female slaves plucked out
<lb/>The scented tresses of their musky hair,
<lb/>While the beloved <persName>Farud</persName> plucked out their lives:
<lb/>The throne was strewn with hair, the house all
<lb/>Sorrow.
<lb/>Then with a faint glance and a sigh he turned
<lb/>Toward his mother and the slaves, and said,
<lb/>With one last effort to unclose his lips :—
<lb/><q>It is no marvel that ye pluck your hair ;
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> will come with girded loins
<lb/>To sack the hold and make my slave-girls captive,
<lb/>Make castle, castle-wall, and rampart waste.
<lb/>Let all whose hearts and cheeks burn for my life
<lb/>Go fling themselves down from the battlements
<lb/>That none may be the portion of <persName>Bizhan</persName>.,
<lb/>I follow soon because he severeth
<lb/>My blameless life and is, in this my day
<lb/>Of youth, my death.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He spake, his cheeks grew wan,
<lb/>His spirit soared away 'mid grief and anguish.
<lb/>As 'twere a conjurer this drunken sky
<lb/>Deludeth us with tricks—threescore and ten—
<lb/>At whiles employing blast or cloud and then
<lb/>The sword or dagger or the agency
<lb/>Of some unworthy wight. At whiles to one
<lb/>Plunged in calamity 'twill grant relief,
<lb/>At whiles allot crown, treasury, and throne,
<lb/>At whiles chain, dungeon, bitterness, and grief!
<lb/>Man must accept his lot whate'er it be ;
<lb/>Mine own affliction is my poverty.
<lb/>The man of wisdom, had he died at birth,
<lb/>Had suffered not the heat and cold of earth,
<lb/>But, living after birth, hath want and stress,
<lb/>Constrained to weep a life of wretchedness.
<pb n="66"/> 
<lb/>Woe for his heart, his usance, and intents!
<lb/>His pillow is the dust in all events.</p></div>

<lb/>Now when in failure thus had passed away

<lb/>She sought the couch of glorious <persName>Farud</persName>,

<lb/>Shrewd Paldshan, a youthful warrior,
<lb/>The leader of their host, to view the foe,
<lb/>And count the camp-enclosures and the flags,
<lb/>Within the lines there was a rising ground
<lb/>On one side, and unoccupied by troops:
<lb/>There <persName>Giv</persName> was sitting with <persName>Bizhan</persName>, conversing

<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> said: <q> Man of name! the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> bestowed

<lb/><q>Haste not to battle with this savage Lion,</q>

<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Oh! put me not to shame before the world-lord

<p><lb/>Then gallant <persName>Giv</persName> gave him the coat of mail.

<lb/>My grandsire is a Lion of the fray,

<p><lb/>He answered not but gave his mighty steed
<lb/>The rein. The warriors closed, the dark dust flew.
<lb/>Their spear-points brake ; both took their scimitars,
<lb/>Which shivered with their strokes. The riders shook
<lb/>Like leaves upon a tree, the steeds were drowned

<p><lb/>On the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> side
<lb/>A tempest rose and none took thought of fight ;
<lb/>A dense cloud came like flying dust, their lips
<lb/>Congealed with cold, the tents and camp-enclosures
<lb/>Were turned to ice, snow carpeted the mountains,
<lb/>And for a sennight’s space earth disappeared.
<lb/>There was but little food or rest or sleep:
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Earth’s face is turned to stone.</q>
<lb/>They slew and ate their horses. Multitudes
<pb n="72"/>

"Tis well that we proceed upon our march.

<lb/>Look through the host and see whom thou canst find

<lb/>Through whom my cup was filled with wine and milk.
<lb/>His form was youthful but his words were sage.
<lb/>Now let us speak no further of the past,

<lb/>Or, if it be, a toil not unrequited.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> was grieved: <q>I cannot give,</q> he said,

<p><lb/>He passed the Kasa rid albeit with stress,
<lb/>The world for warp and woof had ice and snow,
<lb/>And when he reached the barricade of faggots
<lb/>Its length and breadth were more than he could tell;
<lb/>He used a javelin-point to kindle fire,

<lb/>By birth and worth I am <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs>,

<lb/>Would any leave <placeName>Iran</placeName> and settle here
<lb/>Unless he lived on blood or colocynth ?
<lb/>If thou art marchlord and king’s son-in-law
<lb/>How is it that thou hast not mightier powers ?
<lb/>With such a band as this seek not the fray,
<lb/>Nor go with vehemence against the brave;
<lb/>For I who speak—a hero worshipful
<lb/>And famous—trample on the heads of marchlords.
<lb/>If thou with all thy troops wilt do my bidding,
<lb/>And hence depart Iranward to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<pb n="76"/>
<lb/>Go first of all to <persName>Tus</persName> our general,
<lb/>Apply to him, and hearken to his words.
<lb/>I will take care that thou shalt have a gift
<lb/>From him—goods, slaves, and steeds caparisoned.
<lb/>This seemeth well to me, O prudent man!
<lb/>What say’st thou? Shall I have to fight to-day ?</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="835"/>
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName> the traitor said: <q>O gallant one!
<lb/>None lowereth my flag. Now I have here
<lb/>The throne and signet, horses, flocks, and soldiers ;
<lb/>Moreover in <placeName>Iran</placeName> no person dreameth
<lb/>Of such a king as is <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Slaves too have I, and herds of wind-foot steeds,
<lb/>Which wander over mountain, vale, and plain.
<lb/>Look not upon my little. band but me,
<lb/>And at the mace upon my saddle-bow,
<lb/>For I will maul thy troops to-day till thou
<lb/>Repent thy coming.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Bizhan</persName> exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>O famous chief—engrosser of the fight,
<lb/>Exalted and shrewd-hearted paladin !
<lb/>In age thou art not as thou wast in youth.
<lb/>Why givest thou this counsel to <persName>Tazhav</persName>?
<lb/>Why so much love and amity for him?
<lb/>Our business is to draw the sword and mace,
<lb/>And to cut out these peoples' hearts and brains.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He urged his steed; the battle-cry went up;
<lb/>They laid upon their shoulders sword and mace.
<lb/>A cloud of murky dust rose in the midst
<lb/>So that the sun became invisible,
<lb/>The world grew gloomy as a winter's cloud,
<lb/>And men beheld not shining star or moon.
<lb/>Bold <persName>Giv</persName> who used to rob the sky of lustre
<lb/>Was in the midst, <persName>Bizhan</persName> the deft of hand,
<lb/>Who dallied not in action, led the van.
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName>, who wont to fight the rending lion,
<lb/>And wore his crown, opposed them with Arzhang
<pb n="77"/>
<lb/>To help him and Mardwi the Lion—two
<lb/>That wearied not of fight yet gat small fruit
<lb/>That day, for brave Arzhang withdrew himself,
<lb/>The more part of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> troops were slain,
<lb/>And froward fortune turned its head away.
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName> the valiant fled. That famous Lion,
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>, pursued him, shouting eagerly,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="836"/>
<lb/>And with a spear in hand. Thou wouldst have said:— 
<lb/><q>It is a maddened, roaring elephant !</q>
<lb/>One spear-blow struck <persName>Tazhav</persName> upon the waist,
<lb/>And all his lustihood departed from him.
<lb/>The man reeled, but the <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs> coat of mail
<lb/>Gave not, nor did the fastenings of it break.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> flung down his spear and made a clutch,
<lb/>Like leopard springing at a mountain-sheep,
<lb/>And then, as faleon bindeth lark, snatched off
<lb/>That crown of great price which Afrisiyab
<lb/>Had set upon his head, a crown that never
<lb/>Was absent from his thoughts and from his dreams.
<lb/>He urged his steed toward the castle-gate,
<lb/>Pursued thus by <persName>Bizhan</persName> at lightning-speed,
<lb/>And, when he neared the castle, Ispanwi
<lb/>Came wailing with her face suffused with tears,
<lb/>And cried out loudly to him: <q>O <persName>Tazhav</persName>!.
<lb/>Where are thy host, thy mettle, and thy might
<lb/>That thou shouldst turn thy back upon me thus,
<lb/>And leave me in this castle shamefully ?
<lb/>Give me a seat behind thee; let me not
<lb/>Be left inside the castle for the foe.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The heart of proud <persName>Tazhav</persName> was set on fire,
<lb/>And his cheeks flamed. She mounted swift as wind
<lb/>Behind him on his steed and clasped his waist,
<lb/>He rushed along like dust with Ispanwt;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="837"/>
<lb/>They made toward <placeName>Turan</placeName>. The charger sped
<lb/>Awhile till man and beast were both fordone,
<lb/>And then Tazhay addressed his hanamaid, saying :—
<pb n="78"/>
<lb/><q>O my fair mate! here is a grievous case !
<lb/>My charger is exhausted with this work,
<lb/>Foes are behind, in front is a ravine,
<lb/>And though we race <persName>Bizhan</persName> some distance yet
<lb/>Still they will have their will of us at last ;
<lb/>So as they are not enemies to thee
<lb/>Remain behind while I urge on my horse.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then Ispanwi alighted from the steed :
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName>’s face was all tears at losing her,
<lb/>Yet sped he on to reach <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>And all the while <persName>Bizhan</persName> was in pursuit,
<lb/>Who when he spied the moon-faced Ispanwi,
<lb/>Her musky hair descending to her feet,
<lb/>Came to her, took her with all gentleness,
<lb/>Made room for her behind him, and returned
<lb/>Toward the army of the paladin.
<lb/>He reached the entrance of the tent of <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>Rejoicing, whence arose the sound of drums,
<lb/>Because <persName>Bizhan</persName>, that horseman brave and wary,
<lb/>Was coming with his quarry from the fight.
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> and the chiefs—those lovers of the fray—
<lb/>Then set themselves to pillaging the hold,
<lb/>And afterward they went to seek the herds
<lb/>That roamed about the desert of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>They took, as warriors are wont, their lassos,
<lb/>And quickly furnished all the host with steeds,
<lb/>While in the palace whence <persName>Tazhav</persName> had fled
<lb/>Were fierce <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> horsemen lodged instead.</p></div>

<lb/>Now when <persName>Tazhav</persName> with wet eyes and in dudgeon
<lb/>Came to the presence of Afrisiyib
<lb/>He spake thus: <q><persName>Tus</persName> the general arrived,
<pb n="79"/>
<lb/>And brought a host with trump and kettledrum,
<lb/>While as for Paldshan and other nobles,

<p><lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Was grieved thereat and sought a remedy,
<lb/>He spake thus to Pirdan the son of <persName>Wisa</persName>:—
<lb/><q>I bade thee: <q>Gather troops from every side,</q>
<lb/>But thou hast loitered through old age or sloth,
<lb/>Or disaffection; many of our kin

<p><lb/>Then all in haste <persName>Piran</persName> the general
<lb/>Went from the presence of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>Called up the troops from all the provinces,
<lb/>Served arms out, paid the soldiers, and marched forth.
<lb/>The frontier passed he gave each man his post,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="839"/>
<lb/>The right wing to <persName>Barman</persName> and to <persName>Tazhav</persName>—
<lb/>Two cavaliers whose strength was that of lions—
<lb/>The left wing to the valiant Nastihan—
<lb/>One in whose clutches lions were as lambs.
<lb/>The world was filled with blast of clarions,
<lb/>And clang of cymbals and of <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bells,
<lb/>Air was a blaze of or, gules, and purpure
<lb/>With all the spears and divers-coloured flags,
<lb/>While what with troops, steeds, elephants, and camels
<lb/>There was no passage left 'twixt sea and sea.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> went forth in haste. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Departed from his palace to the plains,
<lb/>And numbered all the army man by man
<lb/>To see how many noble warriors
<lb/>There were. He made the total five score thousand—
<lb/>All lion-men and wielders of the sword—
<lb/>Then bright and glad oft blessed <persName>Piran</persName>, and said :-—
<pb n="80"/>
<lb/><q>Thou settest forth with joy to victory:
<lb/>Ne'er may thine eye behold the bale of time.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The army marched along troop after troop,
<lb/>No plain was visible or sea or height ;
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> commanded : <q> Quit the accustomed route,
<lb/>Take the short road; the foeman must not hear
<lb/>Of these my noble and illustrious troops,
<lb/>So may I bring this great host like a mountain

<p><lb/>He sent intelligencers out forthwith,
<lb/>And shrewdly sought to learn how matters stood ;
<lb/>Then, stubbornly proceeding on his march,
<lb/>Advanced toward Giravgard prepared for battle.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="840"/>
<lb/>The chiefs reported what the spies announced :—
<lb/><q><persName>Tus</persName> the commander tarrieth where he was:
<lb/>No sound of drums hath risen from the troops,
<lb/>For all of them are drinking themselves drunk,
<lb/>And wine is in their hands both day and night.
<lb/>He hath no mounted outpost on the road,
<lb/>Not recking of the army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, when he had heard this, called the chiefs,
<lb/>Spake unto them at large about the foe,
<lb/>And said thus: <q> Never in the fight have we

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<head>How <persName>Piran</persName> made a Night-attack on the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></head>
<p>
<lb/>Out of that noble host <persName>Piran</persName> made choice
<lb/>Of thirty thousand horse with scimitars,
<lb/>Who marched at dead of night; no tymbal sounded,
<lb/>No trumpet blared, none raised the battle-cry.
<lb/>Now when the wary chief led forth his troops
<lb/>Seven leagues remained betwixt them and the foe,
<lb/>And first they came upon the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>' herds
<pb n="81"/>
<lb/>At large upon the desert of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>Took many beasts and bore them off withal—
<lb/>Mishap unparalleled! The overseers
<lb/>And herdsmen were all slain, the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>' fortune
<lb/>Had grown averse. Thence like a murky cloud
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> marched upon the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host—
<lb/>All drunken and disposed i in groups unarmed ;
<lb/>Howbeit <persName>Giv</persName> was in his tent alert,
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> the chieftain sober. Then arose
<lb/>The war-cry with the crash of battle-axes,
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName>—that fight-engrosser—was astound.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="841"/>
<lb/>There stood in front of his pavilion
<lb/>A steed caparisoned in battle-gear.
<lb/>The gallant hero lion-like arrayed
<lb/>His body in the mail of SiyAwush,
<lb/>And, raging like a leopard at himself
<lb/>In shame for his own indolence and sloth,
<lb/><q>Up! Up!</q> quoth he. <q>How is it that to-night
<lb/>My brain is filled with fumes instead of war?</q>
<lb/>Then having mounted rushed forth like a blast.
<lb/>He saw the heaven dark with night and dust,
<lb/>And entering the chief's pavilion
<lb/>Exclaimed: <q>Up! Up! The enemy hath come
<lb/>While we—the warriors of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>—are sleeping !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Departing thence he visited his sire,
<lb/>An ox-head mace in hand. As quick as smoke
<lb/>He went about the host, awoke the sober,
<lb/>And chode <persName>Bizhan</persName>: <q> Is this the place for wine
<lb/>Or fighting ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> were hemmed in,
<lb/>The war-cry rose, the tumult dazed the drunken,
<lb/>A cloud ascended and its rain was arrows.
<lb/>Soft pillows were beneath the drunkards' heads,
<lb/>Above were sword, hot mace, and scimitar.
<lb/>Now when dawn showed forth from the Sign of Leo,
<lb/>And gallant <persName>Giv</persName> surveyed the host, he saw
<pb n="82"/>
<lb/>The waste all covered with <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> slain,
<lb/>And watchful fortune’s head averse from them,
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> too looked about on every side;
<lb/>The foemen’s number grew continually ;
<lb/>Against the little force there ranged itself
<lb/>A host like ants and locusts. <persName>Tus</persName> too looked,
<lb/>And saw no fighting-men save <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>And other cavaliers all sore bestead.<ref target="n.82.1"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="842"/>
<lb/>The flags were rent, the kettledrums o'erturned,
<lb/>And the survivors' cheeks like ebony,
<lb/>For sires had lost their sons and sons their sires,
<lb/>And that great host was utterly o'erthrown,
<lb/>Since so the swiftly circling vault, which now
<lb/>Affordeth pleasure and now pain, decreed.
<lb/>Unable to resist they turned their backs,
<lb/>Abandoning their camp in their confusion,
<lb/>Disorganised, without their drums and baggage,
<lb/>And sorely stricken both on left and right.
<lb/>On this wise fared they toward the Kaisa rid—
<lb/>A strengthless mob. With vengeful souls and tongues
<lb/>All jeers the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> horsemen followed <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>And thou hadst said that maces from the clouds
<lb/>Rained in the rear on hauberk, helm, and mail.
<lb/>None made a stand, the warriors took refuge
<lb/>Among the mountains, foundered like their steeds,
<lb/>And had no spirit, strength, or staying power.
<lb/>Now at the heights the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host turned back,
<lb/>Exhausted by the fight and long pursuit,
<lb/>And <persName>Tus</persName> no farther feared the foe’s assault.
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> troops bewailed their many lost,
<lb/>Who if they lived were wounded or in bonds—
<lb/>Alike a cause for tears. No crown or throne
<lb/>Remained, no tent, no steed, no warrior ;
<lb/>The land was barren and provided nothing,
<lb/>While nobody went forth to seek the wounded.

<lb/>Deprived of child and grandchild, home and land,<ref target="n.83.2"/>
<lb/>There came the other veteran warriors
<lb/>With broken hearts to seek his leadership.
<lb/>He placed a watchman on a mountain-top

<lb/>While outposts went their rounds on every side

<lb/>Was troubled when he heard, his bosom throbbed
<lb/>With grief. To anguish at his brother's case
<lb/>Was added anguish on the troops' account.

<lb/>That night he uttered malisons on <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>Till cock-crow. Summoning a prudent scribe,
<lb/>And pouring out the fulness of his heart,
<lb/>He wrote a letter in a wrathful strain,
<lb/>With eyes all tears in mourning for his brother,
<lb/>To Farfburz the son of <rs type="role">Shah</rs> Kius—
<lb/>A letter for the chieftains of the host.
<lb/>First in the letter came the praise of Him,
<lb/>Who made both earth and time, thus: <q>In the name
<lb/>Of Him Who is the Lord of sun and moon,
<lb/>And giveth power alike to good and bad!
<lb/>From Him come triumph and defeat, from Him
<lb/>Both good and bad get might and their desire.
<lb/>He fashionéd the world and place and time,
<lb/>He fashionéd ant’s foot and massy mountain,

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> with the flag of <persName>Kawa</persName>,

<lb/>Alas! Alas! my brother, young <persName>Farud</persName>—

<lb/>I was in tears of anguish for my sire,
<lb/>A long while was I burning in that sorrow,
<lb/>And now my brother is the cause of tears!
<lb/>I know not who are friends and who are foes.
<lb/><q>Go not,</q> I said to <persName>Tus</persName>, <q>toward Charam ;
<lb/>Breathe not upon Kalat or <persName>Mount</persName> Sapad,

<lb/>And only rouseth to sit down to drink.
<lb/>There is no prowess in his neighbourhood,

<lb/>When thou shalt read this letter stir thyself;
<lb/>Put far away from thee food, rest, and sleep;
<lb/>Send <persName>Tus</persName> back with all speed, observe mine orders,
<lb/>And heed not other counsels. Thou art chief,
<lb/>The captain of the host; 'tis thine to wear

<lb/>Illustrious <persName>Gudarz</persName> will counsel thee
<lb/>In all; haste not to fight, keep far from wine,
<lb/>Abstain from slumber, seek not at the first
<lb/>To fight through anger, tarry as thou art

<lb/>Then <persName>Giv</persName> will lead thy van for he possesseth

<p><lb/>They sealed this letter with the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s own signet,

<lb/>The leader <persName>Tus</persName> gave up the royal standard,

<lb/>May fortune always give thee victory,
<lb/>Be every day of thine a New Year's Day.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName> took all the kindred of <persName>Naudar</persName>,

<lb/>The things for thee are chains and straps and madhouse;

<lb/>But let there be a one month’s armistice
<lb/>In order that the wounded may recruit.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The brave <persName>Ruhham</persName> went out from <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>And took with him the message and the letter.
<lb/>He went his way, the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> outposts saw him,
<lb/>And asked him who he was and whence he came.
<lb/>Rubham replied: <q>A warrior am I,
<lb/>A man of prowess, weight, and watchfulness—
<lb/>The bearer of a message to <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>From <persName>Fariburz</persName> the son of <rs type="role">Shah</rs> <persName>Kaus</persName>,</q></p>
<p><lb/>A horseman of the outpost went like dust
<lb/>To tell the tidings, and thus spake: <q> Ruhhim,
<lb/>Son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, hath come to see the chief.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> commanded him to be brought in,
<lb/>And treated with all honour and respect.
<lb/>The eloquent <persName>Ruhham</persName> approached in dread
<lb/>Of what the foe might purpose, but <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>On seeing him, received him graciously,
<lb/>And placed him on the throne. <persName>Ruhham</persName> then told
<lb/>His business, and <persName>Piran</persName> said: <q>'Tis no trifle;
<lb/>Ye stirred up strife; we marked no sloth in <persName>Tus</persName>;
<lb/>He crossed the border like a savage wolf,
<lb/>And slaughtered great and small remorselessly.
<lb/>What multitudes he slew or carried off!
<lb/>Our country’s weal and woe were one to him.
<lb/>Still now, although they took us unaware,
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> are repaid for their ill deeds;
<lb/>So if thou art the captain of the host:
<lb/>Demand of me according as thou needest.
<lb/>If thou wilt have a month of armistice
<lb/>None of our horsemen shall go forth to fight.
<lb/>If thou wilt fight I too am fain for war;
<lb/>Prepare and set the battle in array.
<lb/>If ye will use the month that we accord
<pb n="89"/>
<lb/>In marching from the frontiers of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>And in a swift retreat. to your own borders,
<lb/>Ye will behold your reputation saved ;
<lb/>But if not we will close with you in fight ;
<lb/>Ask not for any armistice henceforth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He gave a robe of honour to <persName>Ruhham</persName>,
<lb/>One suited to a man of his repute,
<lb/>And brave Ruhhim conveyed to <persName>Fariburz</persName>
<lb/>A letter like the one that he had brought.
<lb/>When <persName>Fariburz</persName> had gained a month’s delay
<lb/>He clutched in all directions like a lion.
<lb/>They loosed the fastenings of the money-bags,
<lb/>They gathered bows and lassos from all sides;
<lb/>They went about, reorganised the host,
<lb/>And partially regained what had been lost.</p></div>

<p>
<lb/>When with the ending of the month came war,
<lb/>For they observed their compact honourably,
<lb/>The soldiers' shouts went up on every side,
<lb/>And all set forward to the battlefield ;
<lb/>The din of trumpet, drum, and bell shook heaven,
<lb/>While what with chargers' crests, reins, hands, and swords,
<lb/>Bows, battle-axes, lances, maces, bucklers,
<lb/>And lassos, gnats could find no way. <q>The world,</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="850"/>
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said, <q>is in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s maw,
<lb/>Or heaven level with earth!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Upon the right
<lb/>Was <persName>Giv</persName> son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, an archimage
<lb/>And marchlord, on the left the skilled Ashkash,
<lb/>Who shed blood in a river when he fought ;
<lb/>Before the standard at the army’s centre
<pb n="90"/>
<lb/>Was <persName>Fariburz</persName>, the son of <rs type="role">Shah</rs> <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>With men of battle. He harangued his troops,
<lb/>And said: <q>Till now our prowess hath been hidden,
<lb/>But we will fight to-day as lions fight,
<lb/>And make the world too narrow for our foes ;
<lb/>Else will our maces and our Riman casques
<lb/>Laugh at the host for this disgrace for ever.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They made a heavy rain of arrows fall
<lb/>Like autumn tempests beating on a tree.
<lb/>For arrows and the dust of shouting troops
<lb/>No bird had room to fly, the falchions shone
<lb/>Like diamonds and flamed amid the dust.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q> Earth is a negro’s face ;
<lb/>The stars are warriors' hearts.</q> The multitudes
<lb/>Of maces, spears, and trenchant scimitars
<lb/>Brought Doomsday on the world. <persName>Giv</persName> from the centre
<lb/>Advanced with lips a-foam and raised his war-cry.
<lb/>He with the noble kinsmen of <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>With whom the issue lay for good or ill,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="851"/>

<lb/>Strove with their spears and arrows, showering sparks
<lb/>From steel. <persName>Gudarz</persName> fought fiercely with <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>And slew nine hundred of his kin. Lahhak
<lb/>And Farshidward saw how their mighty host
<lb/>Was going up in dust and charged on <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>Upon his mace-men and his valiant troops.
<lb/>Shafts fell in showers from the chieftains' bows
<lb/>Upon those famous warriors clad in mail
<lb/>Till none could see the surface of the ground,
<lb/>Earth was so hidden by the mass of slain,
<lb/>While no man turned his back upon another
<lb/>Or left his post. At length <persName>Human</persName> spake thus
<lb/>To Farshidward: <q>We must attack the centre,
<lb/>And, routing <persName>Fariburz</persName>, deprive the host
<lb/>Of his support ; it will be easy then
<lb/>To beat the right wing and to seize the baggage.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They fell upon the centre, <persName>Fariburz</persName>
<pb n="91"/>
<lb/>Fled from <persName>Human</persName>, the fighting line was broken,
<lb/>The haughty chiefs gave way, each took his course,
<lb/>Not one <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> warrior stood his ground.
<lb/>They saw the drums and standard in position
<lb/>No more, and so with eyes bedimmed with fighting
<lb/>They turned their backs upon the enemy,
<lb/>And in that action only grasped the wind.
<lb/>The tymbals, spears, and standard were o'erthrown,
<lb/>Men could not tell the stirrup from the rein,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="852"/>
<lb/>For they had lost all stomach for the fight ;
<lb/>The mountains and the plains were drenched with blood.
<lb/>Then <persName>Fariburz</persName>, as foes were gathering
<lb/>On every side, made for the mountain-skirt
<lb/>With those <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> whose life was whole,
<lb/>Although for such a life one needs must weep.
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName> with many warriors
<lb/>Of fame among the troops still held their own;
<lb/>But when <persName>Gudarz</persName> observed the centre bare,
<lb/>No flag of <persName>Fariburz</persName>, no chiefs or troops,
<lb/>He turned with heart afire as if to flee:
<lb/>'Twas Doomsday for the kindred of <persName>Gudarz</persName>.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> said to him: <q>O ancient general !
<lb/>Much hast thou seen of mace, and sparth, and arrow,
<lb/>And if thy purpose is to flee <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>I needs must scatter dust upon my head.
<lb/>Of chieftains and of veteran warriors
<lb/>There will remain not one alive on earth.
<lb/>For thee and me there is no cure for dying.
<lb/>Death is the very last calamity,
<lb/>And, since our ruggéd hour hath come upon us,
<lb/>The foe should see thy face and not thy back.
<lb/>I will not quit my post, let us not shame
<lb/>Thy father’s dust. Hast thou heard never then
<lb/>This ancient saying from some man of lore :—
<lb/><q>When buttressed back to back two brethren stand
<lb/>A mountain-mass is but as dust in hand</q>?
<pb n="92"/>
<lb/>Thou art alive with seventy valiant sons,
<lb/>And thou hast many Elephants and Lions
<lb/>Among thy kindred. Break we with our swords
<lb/>The foe’s heart and uproot him though a Mountain.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName>, when he had heard the words of <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>And marked the helmed heads of his warrior-kin,
<lb/>Repented of his cautious rede and took
<lb/>A firmer stand. Guraza, <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/>With Barta and brave Zanga came to them,
<lb/>And made a compact by a binding oath :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="853"/>
 
<lb/><q>Though maces stream with blood we will not quit
<lb/>This field, but, back to back, strive to retrieve
<lb/>Our honour lost.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They took their stand and plied
<lb/>The mace. Full many a noble foe was slain,
<lb/>But fortune favoured not the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>Then old <persName>Gudarz</persName> said to <persName>Bizhan</persName>: <q> Depart
<lb/>Hence quickly, take with thee thy mace, and arrows,
<lb/>Direct thy horse’s reins toward <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>And bring me <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard. It may be
<lb/>That Farfburz will come with it himself,
<lb/>And flush the face of earth with violet.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> on hearing this urged on his steed,
<lb/>Came like <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs> to <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>And said to him: <q> Why art thou hiding here ?
<lb/>Employ thy reins as warriors use to do,
<lb/>And stay no longer on the mountain-top;
<lb/>But if thou wilt not come entrust to me
<lb/>The flag and horsemen with their blue steel swords.</q>
<lb/>But <persName>Fariburz</persName>, no mate for wisdom then,
<lb/>Cried out: <q>Away! Thou art in action rash
<lb/>And new to war. The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> gave me the standard,
<lb/>The host, crown, throne, and leadership. This flag
<lb/>Becometh not <persName>Bizhan</persName> the son of <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>Or any other warrior in the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> laid hand upon his blue steel sword,
<pb n="93"/>
<lb/>Struck at the standard, clove it in the midst,
<lb/>Seized half thereof and, rushing from the throng,
<lb/>Made off to bear the banner to the host.
<lb/>Now, when the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> saw it on the way,
<lb/>A band of lion-hearted warriors
<lb/>Went toward <persName>Bizhan</persName> and drew their iron sparths,
<lb/>And blue steel swords, to fight for <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard.
<lb/>Then spake <persName>Human</persName>: <q>Yon is the violet flag
<lb/>Wherein is all the virtue of <placeName>Iran</placeName>;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="854"/>
<lb/>If we can take it we shall make the world
<lb/>Strait to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> strung up his bow
<lb/>As quick as dust, discharged a shower of arrows
<lb/>Upon his foes, and, as he drove them back,
<lb/>Prepared a banquet for the ravening wolf.
<lb/>The cavaliers hard by said unto <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>And <persName>Gustaham</persName>: <q>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> are retreatiag ;
<lb/>Perchance <persName>Bizhan</persName> is coming with the standard.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The brave chiefs of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host advancing
<lb/>With massive maces slew the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> horse
<lb/>In numbers. Famed <persName>Bizhan</persName> arrived apace,
<lb/>And thence the chieftains held the ground for him
<lb/>Up to the host. Like lion fierce he came
<lb/>With <persName>Kawa</persName>’s flag, the soldiers gathered round it,
<lb/>And air grew violet-dim with horsemen’s dust.
<lb/>Once more the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host advanced to fight,
<lb/>And in the foremost rank Rfvniz was slain,
<lb/>Who was as dear as life to Kai Kilts,
<lb/>A younger son, a prince who wore a crown,
<lb/>Beloved by <persName>Fariburz</persName>. When that head fell
<lb/>Full many a noble hero rent his clothes,
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName> exclaimed: <q>Chiefs, valiant warriors!
<lb/>Upon this field of battle <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <rs type="role">Shah</rs> <persName>Kaus</persName>, esteemed <persName>Rivniz</persName>
<lb/>Above all else. The grandson and the son
<lb/>Of old <persName>Kaus</persName>—<persName>Farud</persName> the son of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<pb n="94"/>
<lb/>And now <persName>Rivniz</persName>—have perished all in vain!
<lb/>What greater wonder hath the world in store ?
<milestone unit="vullers" n="855"/>
<lb/>We must not let his crown fall to the foe
<lb/>Amid the ranks of war, for that would be
<lb/>Disgrace upon disgrace through it and through
<lb/>The slaughter of <persName>Rivniz</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now brave <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>The noble chieftain, heard the words of <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>And o'er that crown the battle rose afresh.
<lb/>On both sides many fell and fortune quitted
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, yet <persName>Bahram</persName> the warrior
<lb/>Charged lion-like the foe and carried off
<lb/>The crown upon his spear-point, while both hosts
<lb/>Stood wondering, the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> full of joy
<lb/>At rescuing that crown so late assumed.
<lb/>The combat waxed more fierce, none turned aside,
<lb/>They raged and smote each other on the head
<lb/>Until the day grew dark, and eyes were baffled.
<lb/>Eight of the kinsmen of <persName>Gudarz</persName> survived ;
<lb/>The rest had fallen on the battlefield<ref target="n.94.1"/>
<lb/>Of <persName>Giv</persName>’s seed there had perished five and twenty—
<lb/>Men who were fit for diadem and treasure—
<lb/>With seventy of the offspring of <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>All cavaliers and Lions in the fight,
<lb/>Besides <persName>Rivniz</persName> that crownéd warrior,
<lb/>No unit merely in the reckoning.
<lb/>Nine hundred horsemen, kinsmen of <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>Were missing in the battle on that day,
<lb/>While of the lineage of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>The fortunes of three hundred slept, howbeit
<lb/>The field, the day, and therewithal the standard—
<lb/>The lustre of the world—were with <persName>Piran</persName>:
<milestone unit="vullers" n="856"/>

<lb/>'Twas not the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>' day for combating ;
<lb/>Their combat-seeking ended in mishap,
<note n="94.1">See Vol. ii. p. 4. The eight survivors include <persName>Gudarz</persName> himself and his grandson <persName>Bizhan</persName>.</note>
<pb n="95"/>
<lb/>They turned their faces from the battlefield,
<lb/>Abandoning the wounded to their fate.
<lb/>Now <persName>Gustaham</persName> had had his charger killed
<lb/>As fortune turned away, and he in mail
<lb/>Went spear in hand afoot like one bemused.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>, approaching him as day grew dark,
<lb/>Said to him: <q>Ho! Get up and ride behind me:
<lb/>There is none dearer to me than thysolf.</q>
<lb/>So both of them bestrode a single charger.
<lb/>When day was done they sought the mountain-skirt,
<lb/>Abandoning the battle in a rout.
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> cavaliers, with joyful hearts
<lb/>Released from travail and anxiety,
<lb/>Returned to their own camp with haughty mien
<lb/>And fit for fight, while on the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> side
<lb/>The ears were deafened by heart-rending cries,
<lb/>As all mourned on the mountain friend or kinsman.
<lb/>Such is the process of this ancient sky !
<lb/>Turn as it may there is no remedy,
<lb/>And still it turneth o'er us loving none,
<lb/>But treating friend and enemy as one,
<lb/>Well may it be a cause of dread to all

<p>
<lb/>That night, when both the armies were at rest,

<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> came to his sire in haste and said :—
<lb/><q>O mine illustrious sire and worshipful !
<lb/>When I retrieved that crown, and raised it cloudward
<lb/>Upon my spear, I lost a whip of mine.
<lb/>Those villain <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>, when they pick it up,
<lb/>Will break their jests upon the great <persName>Bahram</persName> ;
<lb/>The world will be all ebon in mine eyes,

<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> general will use a whip
<lb/>That hath my name inscribed upon the leather.
<lb/>I will go quickly and recover it
<lb/>However great and long the toil may be.
<lb/>Doth this ill come upon me from the stars
<lb/>That my renown may go down to the dust ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Said old <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q>O son! thou wilt but end
<lb/>Thy fortunes. Wilt thou face the foemen’s breath
<lb/>So madly for a stick bound round with leather?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> said: <q>My brother! go not forth. New whips
<lb/>Have I in plenty—one whose haft is gold
<lb/>And silver, two with handles of fine pearls
<lb/>And other gems. When Farangis unlocked
<lb/>The treasury and gave so many arms
<lb/>And belts to me I took this whip and breastplate ;
<lb/>The rest I left unheeded in <placeName>Turan</placeName>.<ref target="n.96.1"/>
<lb/>Moreover <rs type="role">Shah</rs> Kaiis bestowed upon me

<p><lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> misread
<lb/>God’s purpose, and his fortune proved averse.
<lb/>The fool is all agog to take his leap
<lb/>Just when his fortune falleth into sleep!
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> pricked forth by moonlight to the field,
<lb/>And bitterly bewailed the slain, those luckless
<lb/>And heart-seared ones. The body of <persName>Rivniz</persName>
<note n="96.1">See Vol. ii. p. 376.</note>
<pb n="97"/>
<lb/>Was whelmed in blood and dust, his tunic rent.
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> the Lion wept for him and cried :—
<lb/><q>Alas! O young and valiant cavalier !
<lb/>Men slain like thee are but a pinch of dust !
<lb/>For nobles palaces, for thee a trench !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Among his brethren flung on that broad plain
<lb/>He roamed. One, stricken by the scimitar,
<lb/>Of all those chiefs still lived. He marked <persName>Bahram</persName>,
<lb/>Wailed, asked his name, and said: <q>O Lion! I live,
<lb/>Though flung among the slain, and I have craved
<lb/>For two days bread and water and a robe
<lb/>To sleep upon !</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> made haste to him
<lb/>With loving spirit and a kinsman’s heart,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="859"/>

<lb/>Began to weep and lacerate his cheeks,
<lb/>Rent his own raiment into strips to bind
<lb/>The wounds, and said: <q> Fear not; 'tis but a scratch,
<lb/>And merely needeth binding. Thou shalt go,
<lb/>When I have bound it, to the host again,
<lb/>And speedily recover of thy hurts.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He thus restored one that was lost but knew not
<lb/>That he himself was doomed to lose his way.
<lb/>He said: <q>Stay here, youth! till I hurry back.
<lb/>While I was fighting for the crown I dropped
<lb/>My whip; when I have found it I will come,
<lb/>And take thee to the army with all speed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thence hasting to the centre of the field
<lb/>He searched about until he found the whip,
<lb/>Which was amid a heap of wounded men
<lb/>With much dust showered thereon and blood withal.
<lb/>Alighting from his steed he took it up,
<lb/>And heard the sound of neighing. His steed likewise
<lb/>Perceived the neighing of some mares, became
<lb/>As nimble as <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>, rushed off,
<lb/>And turned its head toward them while <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>In dudgeon followed after in his tunic
<pb n="98"/>
<lb/>And helmet, with the sweat upon his face
<lb/>With hurrying, until he reached the horse
<lb/>And, having caught it, mounted carrying
<lb/>In hand an <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword; but, when he spurred,
<lb/>The steed moved not a foot. Both man and horse
<lb/>Were covered o'er with dust and sweat. <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>Was so chagrined that with his scimitar
<lb/>He slew the steed. Thence to the battlefield
<lb/>He went as swift as wind. There all the plain
<lb/>Was covered with the dead, and all the ground
<milestone unit="vullers" n="860"/>

<lb/>Like cercis-bloom. <q>How can we make our way
<lb/>Upon the plain,</q> he said, <q> without a horse?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The foe grew ware of him and from the centre
<lb/>There hasted forth a hundred cavaliers
<lb/>To capture him and from the battlefield
<lb/>Convey him to <persName>Piran</persName>. <persName>Bahram</persName> the Lion
<lb/>Strung up his bow and showered shafts upon them—
<lb/>A hero’s shafts—so who could bide about him ?
<lb/>He slew or wounded most of them and sprang
<lb/>Like some fierce lion at his enemies.
<lb/>The rest withdrew and sought <persName>Piran</persName>, exclaiming :—

<p><lb/>One replied :—

<lb/>And day and night have I been combating ;
<lb/>But yet I must resume the fight forthwith
<lb/>Unless thou wilt provide me with a steed
<lb/>To bear me back to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>Back to the old <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said : <q> Know’st thou not, O atheling!
<lb/>That I can countenance no such design ?
<lb/>What I suggested is the better course:
<lb/>Thou art a brave man; act not recklessly.
<lb/>Consider that the horsemen of our host
<lb/>Hold it no small dishonour to themselves
<lb/>That many of the scions of the great—
<lb/>Men who wore diadems, well skilled in war—
<lb/>Were killed or wounded by thee in the fight,
<lb/>And smirched with dust. Who will approach <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>Now but with tingling in his blood and brain ?
<lb/>If there were no fear of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>And that his heart would be enraged at me,
<lb/>I would, O youth! provide thee with a steed
<lb/>To bear thee homeward to the paladin.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He spake thus, turned about, and went his way,
<lb/>Love in his heart but prudence in his head,
<lb/>While from the host <persName>Tazhav</persName>—a man whose might
<lb/>Surpassed an elephant’s—came forth to meet him,
<lb/>And asked him what had passed. <persName>Piran</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>There is no warrior equal to <persName>Bahram</persName>.
<lb/>I gave him out of kindness much good counsel,
<lb/>Showed him his course, and proffered goodly league ;
<lb/>Mine offers found no access to his heart ;
<lb/>He fain would go back to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName> replied: <q> Love will not win his soul ;
<lb/>Now I will go and if I capture him
<lb/>Afoot will put him 'neath the stones forthwith.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He hurried to the field impetuously,
<lb/>Where brave <persName>Bahram</persName> was all alone in arms,
<lb/>And, when he saw <persName>Bahram</persName> with spear in hand,
<pb n="101"/>
<lb/>Cried loudly like a furious elephant,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Thou wilt not get away
<lb/>In this fight from these famous warriors.
<lb/>Dost thou expect to go back to <placeName>Iran</placeName> ?
<lb/>Dost thou expect to lift thy head on high ?
<lb/>Thou hast cut off our princes' heads. Abide,
<lb/>For now thine own time draweth to a head.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade his mates: <q>Lay on and give it him
<lb/>With arrow, double-headed dart, and dagger.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The troops closed in a body on <persName>Bahram</persName>,
<lb/>All who were chief among the valiant men,
<lb/>While he the hero having strung his bow
<lb/>Dimmed with his shafts the brightness of the sky.
<lb/>When arrows failed he took his spear in hand,
<lb/>Till plain and hill were like a sea of gore,
<lb/>And when the spear was cloven he still shed blood
<lb/>With mace and sword like raindrops from a cloud.
<lb/>The fight continued on this wise: <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>Was wounded by the shafts of his brave foes,
<lb/>And, when the hero’s strength and vigour failed,
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName> came up and struck him from behind
<lb/>A sword-cut on the shoulder. Brave <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>Fell from the hillock on his face; the hand
<lb/>That used to wield the sword was smitten off;
<lb/>He ceased from combating and all was over.
<lb/>E'er fell <persName>Tazhav</persName> grew hot of heart for him,
<lb/>And, as in shame and grief he turned his reins,
<lb/>He felt the warm blood tingling in his veins.</p></div>

<p>
<lb/>When bright Sol showed its back, <persName>Giv</persName>, heart-oppressed
<lb/>About his brother, spake thus to <persName>Bizhan</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Joy of my heart! my brother cometh not!
<pb n="102"/>

<lb/>We must go forth and ascertain his case;
<lb/>Let us not have to sorrow for the slain.</q>
<lb/>The valiant pair departed swift as dust
<lb/>Toward the battlefield—the place of strife.
<lb/>They sought him everywhere and, having found him,
<lb/>Rushed anxiously toward him, shedding tears
<lb/>Of blood. He lay—a wreck of gore and dust ;
<lb/>One hand was severed ; all was over with him.
<lb/>The gallant <persName>Giv</persName> fell from his charger’s back,
<lb/>And roared out like a lion. At the sound
<lb/><persName>Bahram</persName> moved, turned, and gaining consciousness
<lb/>Spake thus to <persName>Giv</persName>: <q>O seeker after fame!
<lb/>When thou hast shrouded me upon my bier
<lb/>Avenge me on <persName>Tazhav</persName> ; that Bull may not
<lb/>Withstand the Lion. From the first <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName>Wisa</persName>, proved a friend to me,
<lb/>Unlike the chiefs of <placeName>Chin</placeName> who sought revenge,
<lb/>And then <persName>Tazhav</persName>, the injurious, gave these wounds,
<lb/>Forgetting birth and rank.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, when <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>Had spoken this, wept tears of gall and said :—
<lb/><q>I swear by God the Judge Omnipotent,
<lb/>By white day and by azure night that till
<lb/>I shall avenge <persName>Bahram</persName> my head shall see
<lb/>No covering save a Riman helm.</q></p>

<lb/>Now when the world’s face dusked <persName>Tazhav</persName> returned
<lb/>From outpost duty. Spying him afar
<lb/>Brave <persName>Giv</persName> rode toward him with a freer breath
<lb/>On seeing him thus parted from the host,
<lb/>No chiefs or warriors near. <persName>Giv</persName> loosed his lasso,
<lb/>And caught the foe about the waist forthwith,
<lb/>Then placed the lasso 'neath his thigh, wheeled round, 
<lb/>And lightly dragged Tazhiv from saddle-back,
<lb/>Flung him to earth disgraced and all forlorn,
<pb n="103"/>
<lb/>And springing from the saddle bound his hands.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, mounting, like a madman haled <persName>Tazhav</persName>
<lb/>Along the ground who begged for mercy, saying :—
<lb/><q>No fight is left in me, thou valiant man!
<lb/>What have I done that of this countless host
<lb/>Thou givest me to-night a glimpse of Hell?</q>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> struck him with the whip two hundred times
<lb/>Across the head, and answered thus: <q>No words!
<lb/>Dost thou not know, thou wretch! that thou hast set
<lb/>A fresh tree in the garden of revenge—
<lb/>One that will reach to heaven, one whose trunk
<lb/>Is fed on blood while daggers are its fruit ?
<lb/>Since thou must hunt <persName>Bahram</persName> thou shalt explore

<lb/><q>Thou art the eagle and the lark am I,</q>
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName> replied. <q>I bore <persName>Bahram</persName> no grudge,
<lb/>Nor caused his death; the cavaliers of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Had slain him ere I came.</q>
<lb/><q>Pernicious wretch :</q>
<lb/>Said <persName>Giv</persName>, <q> spare thine excuse and futile words.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="866"/>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> dragged him to <persName>Bahram</persName>, the wounded Lion.
<lb/>And said: <q> Behold this faithless head: I pay
<lb/>The savage with the meed of savagery.
<lb/>I thank the Maker, the Omnipotent,
<lb/>That fate hath granted to me time enough
<lb/>To take thy foeman’s life before thine eyes.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName> begged quarter, saying: <q>That hath been
<lb/>Which was to be. How will it profit thee
<lb/>To take my head?</q>
<lb/>Then wallowing in the dust
<lb/>Before <persName>Bahram</persName> he cried: <q>O noble man!
<lb/>I will be thy soul’s slave and wait upon

<p><lb/>Then said <persName>Bahram</persName>
<lb/>To <persName>Giv</persName>: <q> Whoever liveth hath to die.
<pb n="104"/>
<lb/>Though he hath done me hurt he need not taste
<lb/>The pangs of death, so spare his guilty head
<lb/>That he may keep my memory alive.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Giv</persName>, who saw his brother with such wounds,
<lb/>And him that did the hurt a captive, seized
<lb/><persName>Tazhav</persName>’s beard with a shout and headed him
<lb/>As 'twere a lark! <persName>Bahram</persName> wept blood and marvelled
<lb/>At heaven’s processes, then raised a cry
<lb/>Whose like, so strange it was, none ever heard :—
<lb/><q>If I shall slay, or thou slay in my presence,
<lb/>My brothers or my kinsmen will be slain !</q></p>
<p><lb/>This said, the brave <persName>Bahram</persName> gave up the ghost.
<lb/>'Tis ever thus with this world! He that would

<lb/>Brave <persName>Giv</persName> wailed o'er <persName>Bahram</persName> and strewed dark dust
<lb/>On his own head, then, having bound his brother
<lb/>Upon <persName>Tazhav</persName>’s steed, mounted presently.
<lb/>He brought the body from the battlefield,
<lb/>And had a royal sepulchre prepared.
<lb/>He filled the skull with spicery and musk,
<lb/>Enwrapped the corpse in silk of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, and set it
<lb/>In royal state upon an ivory throne
<lb/>To sleep, suspending over it a crown,
<lb/>And painting the tomb’s portal red and blue:

<lb/>Our leader’s fortune hath deserted him,

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, on hearing this, without delay
<lb/>Sent forth spies secretly on every side
<lb/>And, being certified that that proud foe

<lb/>He set forth with an escort at the dawn,
<lb/>And went about to view the battlefield.
<lb/>The plain and mountains, valleys and ravines,
<lb/>Had tents and tent-enclosures numberless.
<lb/>He gave them to the soldiers, marched away,

<lb/>The multitude light-hearted in their gladness
<lb/>Adorned the road whereby <persName>Piran</persName> must pass ;

<lb/>This wealth <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> sent to <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>And added many other gifts beside,

</div>
<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p>In its earlier scenes this campaign is a variant of the preceding one. In both <persName>Tus</persName> commands the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> and is defeated, in both the Gudarzians suffer great losses, in both there are a snow-storm and a night-attack, and in both the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> take refuge on a mountain. Naturally the details vary, but the general similarity is unmistakable. Nothing but the existence of a variant can account for the fact that <persName>Tus</persName> is put in command again after his behaviour in the first campaign, and there is a legend, probably known to <persName>Firdausi</persName>, which puts a different complexion on the matter.<ref target="n.108.1"/> In the poem the difficulty is got over by the intervention of <persName>Rustam</persName>, who begs the culprit off, as he does later on in the case of <persName>Gurgin</persName>.<ref target="n.108.2"/> In the second night-attack, in which the positions of assailants and defenders are reversed,
<persName>Human</persName> takes just the part that <persName>Giv</persName> is represented as taking on the first occasion.
If we are content to regard the account given in the poem of the latter part of this campaign merely as <persName>Firdausi</persName> has pre- sented it, perhaps we may identify the Kashin with which Kamius' name is associated as that mentioned by Tabari<ref target="n.108.3"/> and situated in

Ferghana, which is now a province of Russian Turkist4n. We ought not, however, to overlook the probability that reminiscences of the Parthian civil wars of the days of Gotarzes and Vardanes have been embodied in the story. In this case, as in that of the wars of Gushtisp and Arjisp later on, what in reality were civil broils came in time to be looked back upon as wars between <placeName>Iran</placeName> and <placeName>Turan</placeName>. With the historical fact of the great <rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs> satraps ranging themselves in opposing camps before us, there seems no reason why the Kashin originally intended may not have been the one in <placeName>Persia</placeName> on the highroad between Ispahdn and Tihran.
<persName>Firdausi</persName>’s account, however, clearly favours that in Turkistin, and we must not forget that the nomads took part in the con- tention between the rival Parthian princes.<ref target="n.109.1"/>
§ 28. The story of <persName>Rustam</persName>’s fight with Ashkabts is famous both on account of its own merits and for the curious legend told in connexion with it. One day, it is said, at the court of Mahmud a discussion arose as to the merits of <persName>Firdausi</persName> as a poet, and it was arranged between his supporters and detractors in the presence of the Sultan that he should put one of the legends, of which nothing but the bare facts remained, into verse the same day, to ascertain how far his version could be considered an improvement on the original. The story chosen was that of
<persName>Rustam</persName>’s fight with Ashkabus of Kashin. <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s rendering of the episode delighted the assembly, the lines about the string- ing and discharging of the bow especially fascinating Mahmud, who repeated them several times and praised them highly. That night <persName>Firdausi</persName> dreamed that he met <persName>Rustam</persName> at the gate of
Makna Bad. The hero was on foot, fully armed, of terrible aspect, and with bow in hand, just as the poet had described him.
<persName>Rustam</persName> greeted the poet graciously, but wept and said: <q>I desire to pay my debt to thee, but have not power to do so.
However, when I took the torque from the neck of the foe, and desired not to retain it, I made a hole in the ground yonder with the head of my spear, and buried the torque there. Go now and take it up.</q> He pointed out a little hillock on the sand, and, having placed an arrow upon his bow, shot at it. <persName>Firdausi</persName> remembered the dream and, some time afterward, happening to pass by Maknad Bad in attendance on the Sultan, he made the story known. The mound was excavated, and several torques of red gold were discovered. ‘The Sultin gave them to <persName>Firdausi</persName>, who refused to keep them for himself, and distributed them among the other court poets.<ref target="n.109.2"/>

<head>How <persName>Khusrau</persName> reviled <persName>Tus</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>The troops with <persName>Fariburz</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName>—
<lb/>The shatterer of hosts—went to <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>In grief with tearful cheeks. When they had reached
<lb/>The road toward Charam and had Kalit
<lb/>Above, the waters of Mayam below,
<lb/>They spake about the conflict with <persName>Farud</persName>,
<lb/>And all their gain was anguish and remorse.
<lb/>Fear of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> filled every heart with pain,
<lb/>For they were guilty and their eyes wept blood.
<lb/>They came before <persName>Khusrau</persName> with souls abashed,
<lb/>With wounded livers, and as men in fault
<lb/>For having slain their monarch’s blameless brother,
<lb/>And yielded crown and signet to the foe;
<lb/>They came with hearts seared and with folded arms,
<lb/>As slaves are wont, before their sovereign.
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> regarded them with angry looks;
<lb/>His heart was full of pain, his eyes of tears,
<lb/>And thus he spake to God: <q>O righteous Judge!
<lb/>Thou gavest to me fortune, throne, and prowess,
<lb/>But now I shame before Thee. Thou dost know,
<lb/>Far better than I know, the why and how
<milestone unit="vullers" n="872"/>
<lb/>Of things, or else I should command to set
<lb/>A thousand stakes forthwith upon the open,
<lb/>And <persName>Tus</persName> and all that carried arms with him
<pb n="112"/>
<lb/>Should be impaled. I mourned my father’s death,
<lb/>My heart was filled with sorrow, pain, and trouble,
<lb/>And now there is new vengeance for <persName>Farud</persName>,
<lb/>For I must needs smite off the head of <persName>Tus</persName>.
<lb/>I said: <q> Avoid Kalat, avoid Charam,
<lb/>Though people should shower drachms upon thy head,
<lb/>Because <persName>Farud</persName> is with his mother there.
<lb/>He is a hero of the Kaian race—
<lb/>A warrior.</q> Should he know vile <persName>Tus</persName> or why
<lb/>The army marched? Of course he would attack,
<lb/>And from the mountain slaughter many chiefs.
<lb/>Why did inhuman and insensate <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>March in such haste against that hold? Good sooth!
<lb/>The Master of the sky no longer favoureth
<lb/>Him and the host. The kindred of <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>Fared ill through him. Be he, his elephants,
<lb/>And drums accursed. I gave him robes of honour
<lb/>And gifts, and sent him forth to fight—my brother!
<lb/>Away with chiefs like <persName>Tus</persName> son of <persName>Naudar</persName>!
<lb/>May no such paladins be generals!
<lb/>Alas! alas! the son of <persName>Siyawush</persName>—
<lb/><persName>Farud</persName>—with that stout heart, that mace and sword,
<lb/>Who, like his sire, was slain though innocent,
<lb/>Slain by my general and by my troops!
<lb/>None know I worse than <persName>Tus</persName>, and he is ripe
<lb/>For chain and pit. Brainless and veinless too
<lb/>The wretch is as a dog to me.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He writhed
<lb/>With stricken liver to avenge his brother
<lb/>And father’s blood, dismissed the troops disgraced,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="873"/>
<lb/>Wept his heart’s blood, and shut to them the door
<lb/>Of audience, being wounded to the soul
<lb/>With anguish for <persName>Farud</persName>. The warriors
<lb/>Went sad and sorry to the court of <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>And thus excused themselves: <q>God willed it so!
<lb/>Who wished to fight <persName>Farud</persName>? Still when the son,
<pb n="113"/>
<lb/>Of <persName>Tus</persName> was slain the chieftains' heads grew dark
<lb/>At that disgrace and, when his son-in-law
<lb/><persName>Rivniz</persName> fell too, misfortune’s worst was done.
<lb/>Who knew the name and bearings of <persName>Farud</persName>,
<lb/>And wished to wound him through our monarch’s heart ?
<lb/>Plead with the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>. Perchance he will refrain
<lb/>From vengeance on the host. Was not <persName>Rivniz</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>, slain grievously
<lb/>In fight as well—a younger son and warrior,
<lb/>Dear to the father of moon-faced <persName>Khusrau</persName> ?
<lb/>Such is the issue that all battles have,
<lb/>To this a crown, to that a narrow grave!</q></p></div>

<head>How <persName>Khusrau</persName> pardoned the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs></head>
<p>
<lb/>When Sol had gilt earth’s face, and darksome night
<lb/>Was taken in the toils, shouts rose before
<lb/>The palace portal and the peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Came to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, and said: <q>O great <persName>Khusrau</persName>!
<lb/>Throne, crown, and signet-ring rejoice in thee.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> is wroth with <persName>Tus</persName> and with the host,
<lb/>But pardon their wrong-doing for my sake.
<lb/>When <persName>Tus</persName> beheld his son and son-in-law
<lb/>Both slaughtered, prudence left his brain and heart,
<lb/>For first, he is not wise but choleric,
<lb/>And next, a son’s life is no light concern ;
<lb/>So when <persName>Rivniz</persName> was slain before his face,
<lb/>And that proud cavalier Zarasp withal,
<lb/>No wonder if he blazed. The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> should not
<milestone unit="vullers" n="874"/>
<lb/>Take vengeance on him. Then again the host
<lb/>Was ill disposed toward thy glorious brother
<lb/>Because he had not visited the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.
<lb/>Know that the date when each must die is fixed,
<pb n="114"/>
<lb/>And be not grieved hereat. Our spirit passeth,
<lb/>Or else is made to pass. Three hundred spells
<lb/>Will not delay it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>O paladin! I sorrowed for this youth,
<lb/>But now thy rede is solace to my soul,
<lb/>Though still I ache at heart.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> kissed
<lb/>The ground before the monarch of the world.
<lb/>So when the sun had shot its rays on high,
<lb/>And hastened to ascend upon its curve,
<lb/>When it had rent its turquoise robes of gloom,
<lb/>So that its ruddy, shining form showed through,
<lb/>The general, <persName>Giv</persName>, and other warriors
<lb/>Approached the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> with blessings, and <persName>Tus</persName> said :—
<lb/><q>Live fortunate till time shall be no more.
<lb/>Be earth the basis of thy crown and throne,
<lb/>And heaven the guardian of thy <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and fortune.
<lb/>My heart is sorrowful, my liver wounded
<lb/>With pain for my misdeed, my mind is full
<lb/>Of shame, my tongue is all excuse, my soul
<lb/>All fault, I burn as 'twere <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>
<lb/>In anguish for the pure souls of <persName>Farud</persName>
<lb/>And of Zarasp. If I am guiltier
<lb/>Than others I am writhing for my deed.
<lb/>When valued with <persName>Bahram</persName> and with <persName>Rivniz</persName>
<lb/>Mine own life is not worth a single mite ;
<lb/>So if the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> will cease from wrath with me,
<lb/>And with this noble but offending host,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="875"/>
<lb/>I will go forth to cancel this disgrace,
<lb/>And will exalt our fallen heads anew ;
<lb/>I will share all the army’s toils myself,
<lb/>Be it to keep my life or lose my head.
<lb/>Henceforth I will not look at throne and crown,
<lb/>My head shall see naught but a helm of <placeName>Rum</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The monarch graciously received these words ;
<pb n="115"/>
<lb/>His heart grew fresh as roses in the spring.
<lb/>He counselled much with <persName>Rustam</persName>, with the chiefs
<lb/>And warriors, then sent <persName>Tus</persName> 'gainst <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>With elephants and shawms and kettledrums.
<lb/>The company dispersed without delay,

<lb/>When bright Sol showed, and when from night’s bent bow
<lb/>Dawn brake, <persName>Tus</persName> with the great men of the host
<lb/>Came to <persName>Khusrau</persName> who said: <q> Trace of this feud

<lb/>It had fresh impulse given by <persName>Minuchihr</persName>,
<lb/>But never was a <rs type="role">Shah</rs> so shamed as I,

<p><lb/>The gallant warriors, with folded arms
<lb/>Before that sunlike and aspiring one,

<p><lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> then summoned <persName>Giv</persName> and seated him
<lb/>Upon the throne of greatness, praised him much,
<lb/>Bestowing many a gift and mark of favour,
<lb/>And said: <q>Thou seekest toil on mine account,

<lb/>Must not employ the drums and elephants

<p><lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> gave money, called the commissaries,

<lb/>The chieftain <persName>Tus</persName> then came as general,

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, on hearing this, was sorely grieved

<lb/>How many chiefs, and who, were there with  <persName>Tus</persName>.
<lb/>He drew his troops up on his side the stream,
<lb/>And sent a greeting to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> chief.
<lb/>He said: <q>I everywhere showed kindliness
<lb/>To Farangis and to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>. I cried,
<lb/>And seethed as on fierce fire, for <persName>Siyawush</persName> ;
<lb/>But now the antidote doth bear the bane,

<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> was distressed,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="878"/>
<lb/>And said: <q>Go to <persName>Piran</persName> of ardent soul,

<lb/>Drop fealty, abandon thy surroundings,
<lb/>And bar this door of fear and road of loss.
<lb/>Go to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> alone, he will requite thee,

<lb/>When he recalleth thy good deeds thy pangs
<lb/>Will pain him to the heart. <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>

<p><lb/>The envoy went like wind

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> made answer: <q>I by night and day

<p><lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> thereat convoked his captains,
<lb/>Told what had chanced, and said: <q> Prepare for war.</q>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> arrayed a power that dimmed
<lb/>The eye of Sol; that host, so great that earth
<lb/>Was hidden, on the tenth day reached <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>Who having victualled and disposed the troops,
<lb/>And loaded up the baggage, marched in haste,
<lb/>Regarding not his promise, to the Shahd.
<lb/>A scout came in to <persName>Tus</persName> and said to him :—
<lb/><q>Bind thou the drums upon the elephants
<lb/>Because <persName>Piran</persName>, perceiving downfall nigh,
<lb/>Spake guilefully. We see the tyrant’s standard
<lb/>And army drawn up on the river-bank.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> put his battle in array. They ranged

<lb/>The two lines, like two mountains, clashed in fight—
<pb n="119"/>
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> horsemen and the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> troops.
<lb/>The dust-clouds of the hosts so dimmed the sun
<milestone unit="vullers" n="880"/>
<lb/>That fire rose from the stream—the flash of sword,

<lb/>The golden helmets and the golden shields,
<lb/>A cloud in hue like sandarach arose,
<lb/>And earth became like ebony with dust.
<lb/>The horsemen’s heads beneath the mighty maces
<lb/>Seemed anvils 'neath smiths' hammers. Thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>The river is a wine-press running blood,
<lb/>The air is like a reed-bed with the spears!</q>
<lb/>Then many heads were caught in lasso-coils,
<lb/>Then many an honoured form was cast away.
<lb/>The shroud was mail, the pillow blood and dust ;
<lb/>The bosom had been hacked by scimitars.
<lb/>Earth was a cercis-bloom, air ebony ;
<lb/>The din of tymbals filled the starry heaven.
<lb/>What though the ambitious man a crown may gain.
<lb/>Or but the battle’s surge of blood and dust,
<lb/>Yet from this world of our’s depart he must,

<lb/>And challenged the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>. <persName>Tus</persName> from far
<lb/>Saw him and shouted, drew his sword and asked

<lb/>That son of Zira: <q> What name bearest thou ?
<lb/>Who is thy fellow in the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He said: <q> Arzhang am I, a warrior—

<lb/>Now will I make the earth quake under thee,

<lb/><q>His body never bore a head at all!</q>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> grieved sorely and the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host,
<lb/>And none came forth, but all the warriors

<lb/>And massive mace, and shouted to each other,
<lb/>Those Lions: <q> Let us charge and make the world

<p><lb/>Then said <persName>Human</persName> :—

<lb/>If any noble of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>

<lb/><q>And so from luckless <persName>Wisa</persName>,</q> he exclaimed,

<lb/>Hast thou indeed come forth to fight since thou

<lb/>By the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s life and head I would oppose thee
<lb/>Without my breastplate, mace, and <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs> casque,
<lb/>Just like a pard that clutcheth at its prey
<lb/>Among the mountains. Thou shalt see how heroes
<lb/>Fight if thou venturest.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Human</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Be not o'er-weening for it is not good.
<lb/>Though fate hath come upon one luckless chief,
<lb/>And by thy hand, hold not the rest in scorn.
<lb/>Arzhang had deemed himself no man at all
<lb/>If matched with me upon the day of battle.
<lb/>But have the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> warriors no shame ?
<lb/>Doth not the warm blood boil in any breast
<lb/>In that their leader hath to champion them ?
<lb/>Have their hands failed to fight? Where are <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName>—those noble ones—and where <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>Son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, that taker of the world ?
<lb/>If thou art paladin why hast thou left
<lb/>The centre for the field? The wise will own not
<lb/>Thy kinship and the sane will hold thee mad.
<lb/>Go, hold up <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard ; generals
<lb/>Come not to fight in person. Look for one
<lb/>On whom the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> bestowed a robe of honour,
<lb/>Some warrior in quest of crown and signet,

<lb/>Thou art a leader of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> troops

<lb/>If thy heart will accept advice of mine

<lb/>Come with the noble captain of thy host

<lb/>And may my counsel ne'er recur to thee.
<lb/>Leave those who should be slain to fight with us,
<lb/>For not one guilty shall escape our vengeance,

<lb/><q>Harm not <persName>Piran</persName>. He is my foster-sire,

<lb/>Upon the day of battle at Lidan
<lb/>Thou sawest me with <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword in hand
<lb/>Where not one of his seed survived that read not

<lb/>But neither came to dust. <persName>Human</persName>’s belt snapped.
<lb/>He leapt upon a fresh steed while <persName>Tus</persName> took

<lb/>Brought him a noble mount, but when <persName>Human</persName>
<lb/>Had seated him upon the bark-lined saddle,
<lb/>With <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword in hand, the men of name
<lb/>And warriors all drew near to him and said :—
<lb/><q>It groweth dark, there is no time, and strife

<milestone unit="vullers" n="887"/>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> the warrior turned his rein (<persName>Tus</persName> raising

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>. A shout rose from the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> host :—
<lb/><q>How didst thou fare when face to face with <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>O warrior? Our hearts were full for thee!
<lb/>God only knoweth what we felt!</q></p>
<p><lb/>That Lion
<lb/>Replied: <q> O brave and veteran warriors!
<lb/>The day will bring us triumph, we shall take
<lb/>Yon shining flag, all joy will be your portion,
<lb/>And I shall have the stars of heaven for mine.</q></p>
<pb n="125"/>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> for his part was shouting through the night

<head>How the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> and <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs> Sought the second Time</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now when high heaven had made its Crown of Jet,
<lb/>And flung Pastilles on Lapislazuli,
<lb/>The pickets hurried forth on every side,
<lb/>And set the watch around the camps, but when
<lb/>Sol showed in Cancer, and the world became
<lb/>Fair as a <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs>’s face, from both the camps
<lb/>The sound of tymbals rose, the world was filled
<lb/>With the blare of clarions, air was thick with flags,
<lb/>Which gleamed red, yellow, black, and violet,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="888"/>
<lb/>The warriors bared their weapons, and rode forth
<lb/>To battle. Thou hadst said: <q> Heaven, earth, and time
<lb/>Don iron,</q> while the radiant sun was veiled
<lb/>By dust of caracoling cavaliers,
<lb/>And, what with neigh of steeds and din of drums,
<lb/>Heaven kissed the earth. <persName>Human</persName> the chieftain wheeled
<lb/>Before the ranks, a shining dart in hand,
<lb/>And cried: <q> When I shall raise the battle-shout,
<lb/>Urge on my charger and seethe up with rage,
<lb/>Then draw ye forth your falchions as one man,
<lb/>And hold your shields of <placeName>Chin</placeName> above your heads.
<lb/>See nothing but your horses' crests and reins,
<lb/>I want no bow, I want no lance’s point,
<lb/>But armed with sword and club and massive mace,
<lb/>As is the use and wont of warriors,
<lb/>Throw down your reins upon your horses' necks,
<lb/>And give and take the buffets as they come.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This said, the gallant horseman lion-like
<lb/>Went to <persName>Piran</persName>: <q>O paladin!</q> he cried,
<pb n="126"/>
<lb/><q>Unlock the weapons of our warriors,
<lb/>Keep not dinars within the treasury,
<lb/>And hoard not arms. If we prevail to-day
<lb/>Thy heart shall pluck the fruit of favouring stars.</q></p>
<p><lb/>On his side <persName>Tus</persName> arrayed his host as 'twere
<lb/>The eye of chanticleer. The warriors blessed him,
<lb/>And hailed him as the paladin of earth,
<lb/>Who triumphed in the battle, and whose valour
<lb/>Sent dust up from <persName>Human</persName>. Then to <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>Son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, said <persName>Tus</persName>: <q> Let all wot well
<lb/>That if we march forth, and our foes prevail,
<lb/>Our trust must be in God, not in ourselves ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="889"/>
<lb/>He may assist us, else the day is lost.
<lb/>At present let the chiefs with golden boots
<lb/>Remain with <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard. Let none quit
<lb/>The mountain ; this is not the day and season
<lb/>For strife and stir. Good sooth! the enemy

<p><lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> replied: <q>If God will but avert

<lb/>To wait is no avail. Array the host;

<p><lb/>So  <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>The chieftain, put the battle in array—
<lb/>Men, drums, and elephants of war; the footmen
<lb/>Went with the baggage to the heights, <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>Was on the right, <persName>Ruhham</persName> shared with <persName>Gurgin</persName>
<lb/>The left, the troops were ranked, anon the sky
<lb/>Shook with the roar of drum and clarion,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="890"/>

<lb/>The heart of circling heaven was rent, the sun
<lb/>Was choked with dust, none saw the ground beneath him,
<lb/>The murky clouds rained showers of diamonds,
<lb/>Fire flashed from helm and sword, the spear-heads gleamed,
<pb n="127"/>
<lb/>And massive maces whirled. Thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>The air is mace and iron, and the earth
<lb/>Horseshoes and mail.</q> The plains and dales ran blood,
<lb/>And swords were lamps that lit a world of night.
<lb/>No one knew head from foot, such was the din

<lb/><q>Night cometh and the astrologer hath told me :—
<lb/><q>To-day until the night’s third watch is passed
<lb/>The warriors from their scimitars will pour
<lb/>Blood on the field, like rain from some dark cloud;

<lb/>Came liver-wounded, eager for revenge,
<lb/>Like troops of divs upon a murky night,
<lb/>While in all quarters din assailed the clouds.
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> on his side mountain-huge led forth
<lb/>His army troop on troop, and none could tell,
<lb/>Amid the mass of maces, mallets, swords,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="891"/>
<lb/>And spears, the stirrups from the reins. He said :—
<lb/><q>Our work to-day must not be like the fight

<p><lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName> advanced with foot-men, elephants,

<head>How the <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs> used Sorcery against the Host of <placeName>Iran</placeName></head>
<p>
<lb/>Among the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> there was one Bazur
<lb/>By name, adept in magic, versed in guile
<lb/>And sorcery, and learnéd in the tongues
<lb/>Of <placeName>Chin</placeName> and ancient <placeName>Persia</placeName>. To that warlock
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said: <q>Scale the mountain-top and send
<milestone unit="vullers" n="892"/>
<lb/>Snow, cold, and blast upon the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>.</q>
<lb/>That sorcerer sped thither, and forthwith
<lb/>Came snow and storm. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> spearmen’s hands
<lb/>Failed in the snow and stress. Amid the tumult
<lb/>And icy blast the warriors' war-cry rose,
<lb/>And arrows rained. <q>Let all the army charge,</q>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> bade. <q>While their hands freeze to their spears
<lb/>None can show prowess.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With a shout <persName>Human</persName>
<lb/>Charged like a lusty dfv. They slaughtered so
<lb/>That 'twixt the lines there was a sea of gore,
<lb/>The vales and wastes were filled with snow and blood,
<lb/>The horsemen of <placeName>Iran</placeName> were overthrown,
<lb/>Till corpses left no room to wheel; the ground
<lb/>Was blocked by snow and fallen. <persName>Tus</persName> the leader
<lb/>And other chiefs cried bitterly to heaven :—
<lb/><q>O Higher than all knowledge, sense, and reason,
<lb/>Not at, or in, but everywhere! we all
<lb/>Are Thy transgressing slaves and in our straits
<lb/>Appeal to Thee, for Thou wilt help the helpless,
<lb/>And art the Lord of fire and icy blast.
<lb/>Deliver us from this excessive cold ;
<lb/>We look for aid to Thee and Thee alone.</q></p>
<p><lb/>A sage approached <persName>Ruhham</persName> and showed the height
<milestone unit="vullers" n="893"/>

<lb/>Where bold Bazur was stationed with his spells.
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> wheeled round and quitting field and host,
<lb/>And girding up his mail-skirts to his waist,
<pb n="129"/>
<lb/>Clomb to the mountain-top. The warlock saw him,
<lb/>And, grasping a steel mace of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, advanced
<lb/>To fight. ~ <persName>Ruhham</persName>, approaching, quickly drew
<lb/>His trenchant scimitar and hacked away
<lb/>The warlock’s hand. Like Doomsday came a blast,
<lb/>And swept the murk from heaven. Staying thus
<lb/>The sorcerer’s hand the brave Ruhhiam descended,
<lb/>Regained the plain, and mounted while the air
<lb/>Resumed its azure vault and radiant sun.
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> said to his sire: <q>'Twas sorcerer’s work,
<lb/>And how he played the mischief as we fought !</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s troops saw the field a sea of blood
<lb/>Strewn with <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> heads and headless trunks.
<lb/>Then spake <persName>Gudarz</persName> to <persName>Tus</persName>: <q>No need have we
<lb/>For elephant or drum-beat. Let us all
<lb/>Draw sword and charge, and slay or else be slain.
<lb/>Good sooth! our time is coming to an end;
<lb/>This is no day for lasso, shaft, or bow.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> said: <q>O thou experienced veteran !
<lb/>The sky is ridded of that icy blast.
<lb/>Why should our heads be scattered to the winds,
<lb/>Now that the Helper giveth <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and strength ?
<lb/>Expose not thou thyself, for in this strife
<lb/>Our warriors will avail to do our will. -
<lb/>Go not to meet thy fate or recklessly
<lb/>Advance against our foes but tarry thou
<lb/>With <persName>Kawa</persName>'s standard at the army’s centre,
<lb/>And blue steel sword in hand. <persName>Bizhan</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>Together lead the right ; upon the left
<milestone unit="vullers" n="894"/>
<lb/>Is <persName>Gustaham</persName>; Rubham is with <persName>Shidush</persName>
<lb/>Before the lines; Guraza’s lips are foaming
<lb/>For vengeance. If I shall be slain, retreat
<lb/>Back to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, but death is nobler far
<lb/>For me than shame and every foeman’s jeers.</q>
<lb/>Such is the world, all anguish and all woe
<lb/>Seek not addition if thou canst forbear,
<pb n="130"/>
<lb/>For that will bite thee some day and will ne'er
<lb/>Prolong existence for thee here below.
<lb/>Again arose the blast of clarions,
<lb/>The clangour of the gongs and <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bells.
<lb/>What with the din of warlike cavaliers,
<lb/>The gleam of sword and crash of battle-ax,
<lb/>What with darts, maces, shafts, and javelins,
<lb/>The earth became as 'twere a sea of pitch.
<lb/>The plain was filled with trunkless heads and arms,
<lb/>The crashing of the maces filled all ears,
<lb/>But, since the face of cruel fortune loured
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> warriors showed the foe their backs.
<lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and gallant <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Shidush</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>, and lion-like <persName>Ruhham</persName> all took
<lb/>Their lives in hand and went in quest of fame
<lb/>Before the embattled lines. All those with <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>The nobles and the chiefs, poured out their blood
<lb/>Before the host, but those behind them fled.
<lb/>Then said an archmage to that warrior-chief :—
<lb/><q>The army is no longer at thy back:
<lb/>The foe must not surround thee and destroy
<lb/>Both host and general.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> said to <persName>Giv</persName> :-—
<lb/><q>Our soldiers' brains and wisdom are no mates
<lb/>Since they have left us thus, and in their folly
<lb/>Turned from the fight; go thou and rally them ;
<lb/>Protest our foemen’s jeers, our monarch’s shame.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> went; the host returned; the plain and desert
<lb/>Seemed filled with slain. Then <persName>Tus</persName> addressed the captains :—
<lb/><q>This is a struggle and a strife of chiefs!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="895"/>
<lb/>But since the cheek of day is darkling now,
<lb/>And all the land is like a sea of blood,
<lb/>Seek we a resting-place if night can rest.
<lb/>Our slain perchance a bed of sand may have,
<lb/>And coverlet of earth by way of grave.</q>

<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> drew back with heads abashed

<lb/>To right and left the field was strewn with hands

<lb/>Left strangers to their fate, and burned the slain.
<lb/>Full many of the kindred of <persName>Gudarz</persName>

<lb/>The chiefs all rent their raiment, he himself

<lb/>Why must I still survive with my white hairs
<lb/>Now that so many of my sons are laid

<lb/>My grandsons and my sons supported me,

<lb/>And hence I see so many chieftains slain.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName>, hearing of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, wept tears of blood,
<lb/>And turned as pale as sandarach. He raised
<lb/>A bitter Magian cry: <q>Had not <persName>Naudar</persName>,
<lb/>That holy man,</q> he said, <q>set in life’s garth
<lb/>My feet and roots then travail, pain, and grief,
<lb/>Woe for the dead and anguish in the strife,
<lb/>Had ne'er been mine, for since I girt my loins

<lb/>Now when the bright sun showed its crown, and strewed

<lb/>What while the foe were sleeping with fatigue,
<lb/>Had marched ten leagues, and fared thus day and night
<lb/>With heart all sorrow and unbroken fast.
<lb/>He reached <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName> and ranked his troops
<pb n="133"/>
<lb/>Upon its outskirts. Every eye was bloodshot,
<lb/>Their hearts were seared, their souls like ravens' plumes
<lb/>With anguish. Then spake <persName>Tus</persName> to <persName>Giv</persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>O full of wisdom and illustrious chief!
<lb/>For three days we have marched with neither food
<lb/>Nor sleep! Come eat a little and repose
<lb/>At ease without thy mail; <persName>Piran</persName> no doubt

<lb/>Go to the mount thyself, and leave behind

<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> bare the wounded, weary of the world
<lb/>And sick of life, up to the mountain-hold,
<lb/>And chose the freshest of his troops for duty.
<lb/><q>This mountain-top,</q> he said, <q> must be our home.
<lb/>We must recruit.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The outpost-guards descended
<lb/>To hold the approaches that no foe might pass,
<lb/>And, what with challenges and sound of gongs,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The stones and rocks cry out!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now when the sun rose o'er the mountain-tops
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' hearts were full of eagerness.
<lb/>A sound rose from <persName>Piran</persName>’s pavilion
<milestone unit="vullers" n="898"/>
<lb/>As of an earthquake. He led forth the host
<lb/>Like fire, and told <persName>Human</persName>: <q>The contest surely
<lb/>Will soon be over. All their cavaliers
<lb/>Are slain or, being wounded, cannot fight.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He beat the drums; a shout rose from the waste ;
<lb/>He led in person. When they reached the field
<lb/>They only found a camp without an army,
<lb/>And one who went to spy came to <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>And said: <q>There is not an <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> here!</q></p>
<p><lb/>A shout of triumph rose, the troops awaited

<p><lb/>The horsemen of the host, both old and young,

<lb/>Have fled defeated, and the battlefield

<lb/>To fear them. We should follow up the foe,
<lb/>Strange if thou partest with thy wits and wisdom!
<lb/>The fugitive from wind plunged into water,
<lb/>And we had better hasten than delay.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>In war the foot of haste
<lb/>Is feebler than delay’s. A sea-like host
<lb/>Is gathering before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;
<lb/>Let us delay till that great power with all

<lb/>Then will we leave none living in <placeName>Iran</placeName>:
<lb/>Such is the counsel of the wise. Enough.</q>
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> said to <persName>Piran</persName>: <q>O paladin!
<lb/>Vex not thy soul so much on this account.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="899"/>A host—all paladins and cavaliers,
<lb/>Brave men who wield the lasso and the sword—
<lb/>Have left their ground, their tents, and tent-enclosures,

<lb/>Then from <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName> will <persName>Rustam</persName> march
<lb/>Upon us, this delay cause fearful loss.
<lb/>Now is the time for me to fall on them,
<lb/>And put in practice ruse and artifice.
<lb/>We have the certainty of laying hands
<lb/>Upon <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName> the general,
<lb/>The royal standard, elephants, and drums:
<lb/>Shall we do better by delaying here?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q> Be still thus shrewd and ardent.
<lb/>So do because thy star and rede are good,
<lb/>And heaven’s vault is not so high as thou.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He set forth with his army in pursuit,

<p><lb/>He went like wind,
<lb/>And took no thought of rest and food. At midnight
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> outpost-guards caught sight of him
<lb/>Upon the dusky plain, and from the mountain
<lb/>Rose shout and sound of gong. 'Twas not the time,

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said to <persName>Human</persName>: <q> Ply rein and stirrup

<lb/>In haste, take with thee cavaliers enough,

<p><lb/>He sent <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>A camel-post full speed. <q>What sort of fight
<lb/>Did we expect?</q> he said. <q>Our thoughts were other,
<lb/>And we made ready to attack the foe,
<lb/>But all the mount is troops and kettledrums,
<lb/>The standards wave behind <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>!
<lb/>Take order that as soon as bright day shineth,
<lb/>And when the world’s Light showeth in the sky,
<lb/>Thou mayst be here with troops in war-array,
<lb/>And make the plain’s face dark with hosts of men.</q>
<lb/>The message roused <persName>Piran</persName> ; no time was lost;
<lb/>That night he marched on with a sea-like host.

<p>
<lb/>Hamdwan
<lb/>When Sol, aweary of its veil of gloom,
<lb/>Had bursten through it and come forth, <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>The leader, reached <persName>Mount</persName> Hamdwan, and earth
<lb/>Was hidden by the dust of troops. <q> Abide,</q>
<lb/>Thus said he to Human, <q> here where thou art;
<lb/>Set not the troops in motion for a while.
<lb/>I will hold parley with the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> leader,
<lb/>And say: <q>Why hast thou set up <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard ?</q>
<lb/>Who told him of <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName> and now
<lb/>When there what hopeth he?</q></p>
<p><lb/>In hate and vengeance
<lb/>He came anear the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host and cried :—
<lb/><q>Illustrious <persName>Tus</persName>, the lord of elephant,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="902"/>
<lb/>Of mace and kettledrum ! five months have passed
<lb/>Since thou provokedst war, and on the field
<lb/>The noblest kinsmen of <persName>Gudarz</persName> lie headless,
<lb/>While thou hast fled, thy soldiers panting after,
<lb/>And like a mountain-sheep hast taken refuge,
<lb/>Full of revenge and rancour, in the heights!
<lb/>But thou wilt surely come within the toils.</q>
<lb/>Exalted <persName>Tus</persName> replied: <q>I mock thy falsehoods.
<lb/>Thou didst set wreak afoot among the mighty
<lb/>Throughout the world for <persName>Siyawush</persName>. Hast thou
<lb/>No shame of thy vain words? Hot though they be
<lb/>They will not bring me to those toils of thine.
<lb/>Ne'er may the world possess a paladin
<lb/>Like thee among the men of might and name.
<lb/>Thou by an oath didst ruin <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>And wreck earth with his blood, thou madest him
<lb/>Stay in <placeName>Turan</placeName>; now war and vengeance stay
<lb/>In earth through him. Alas! for that great prince
<pb n="138"/>
<lb/>And noble man whose face once gladdened all !
<lb/>Thou by this practice, such deceit and lies,
<lb/>Wilt gain no lustre in a true man’s sight.
<lb/>We could not forage on the battlefield,
<lb/>And therefore have I marched to Hamdawan.
<lb/>News now hath reached the monarch of the world,
<lb/>Who with his mighty men will come anon.
<lb/>The great men of the host have gathered—Ziil
<lb/>And <persName>Rustam</persName> of the elephantine form ;
<lb/>And when the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> is fairly on the march
<lb/>I will not leave <placeName>Turan</placeName> field, fell, or crop.
<lb/>Since thou art here behold a task for men:
<lb/>This is no time for ruse and ambuscade.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> on that sent forward troops to seize
<milestone unit="vullers" n="903"/>
<lb/>The approaches, and the army mountain-like
<lb/>Moved, troop on troop, upon that mountain-skirt.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, when thus the foemen’s foraging
<lb/>Was straitened, laid his plans.
<lb/><q>We,</q> said <persName>Human</persName>,
<lb/><q>Must get possession of the mountain’s foot,
<lb/>And I will deal so that the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>Shall never gird themselves for vengeance more.</q>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>The wind is in our face,
<lb/>And none would think of fighting with it so;
<lb/>But as they have not room for foraging,
<lb/>And nobody would guard a barren rock,
<lb/>They will no longer heed their general ;
<lb/>With warlike eyes grown dim the troops will come
<lb/>To seek not fight but quarter; 'tis a day
<lb/>For grace and not for setting in array.</q>

<head>How the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> made a Night-attack</head>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName> suspected this; the chiefs
<lb/>Were in dismay. Said old <persName>Gudarz</persName> to <persName>Tus</persName> :—
<lb/><q>We must fight now. If we have three days' provand
<lb/>We have not more, and not one road is open!
<lb/>We have no tents, no huts, no baggage-train,
<lb/>And this great host will starve! So, when the sun
<milestone unit="vullers" n="904"/>
<lb/>Is wan of face and night’s dark veil is seen,
<lb/>Choose we brave cavaliers, descend the heights,
<lb/>And try our fortune in a night-attack,
<lb/>To perish one by one, or else to gain
<lb/>The hero’s crown. Such is the end of battles!
<lb/>One hath the dust, another rank and glory.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> hearkened to <persName>Gudarz</persName>; his heart was full
<lb/>Of pain and of the ancient feud. He bode
<lb/>Till night appeared. The sun set; all was dark.
<lb/>When one watch passed, and men had fallen silent,
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> made him ready, called the men of action,
<lb/>Gave one wing to <persName>Bizhan</persName>, one to <persName>Shidush</persName>
<lb/>And bold Kharrid; the glorious flag he gave
<lb/>To <persName>Gustaham</persName> with much advice and counsel,
<lb/>Then, shouldering with <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Ruhham</persName>, and others
<lb/>The massive mace, made for <persName>Piran</persName> and shocked
<lb/>Like fire the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> centre, All the field
<lb/>Grew like a sea of blood, a mighty shout
<lb/>Rose from the host, the standard of <persName>Piran</persName> -
<lb/>Was cloven, and his troops were panic-stricken.
<lb/><persName>Human</persName>, when he had heard that cry, bestrode
<lb/>His <rs type="ethnic">Arab</rs> black, came up, saw many slain,
<lb/>And many turning from the fight dismayed,
<lb/>Wept tears of blood upon his breast, and shouted :—
<lb/><q>Was there no outpost here? Had ye no stomach
<lb/>For fight? We are three hundred to their one ;
<pb n="140"/>
<lb/>It is ill sleeping on the field of battle!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="905"/>
<lb/>Ho! out with sword and mace, and up with shield
<lb/>Of <placeName>Chin</placeName>. Now that the moon o'er yonder height
<lb/>Is drawing forth its sword, cut off the foe
<lb/>On every side and let none, combatant
<lb/>Or laggard, ’scape.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Arose the clarions' blast,
<lb/>The warriors pressed forward, and surrounded
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> cavaliers like savage lions.
<lb/>Sparks flashed from helm and sword: thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>The sky is raining maces from the clouds!</q>
<lb/>Night, scimitars, and dust concealed the stars
<lb/>And shining moon. Thou'dst said: <q>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>Are walled by coats of mail and in a murk
<lb/>As of a sea of pitch!</q> Then to his men
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> exclaimed: <q> Enough! slay not the chiefs ;
<lb/>Bring me them captive and not arrow-pierced.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They shouted back: <q>Their plight is hopeless now.
<lb/>Lay on, lay on with mace and javelin,
<lb/>And crown these chieftains' heads with crowns of blood.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName> said to <persName>Ruhham</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>: <q>Good sooth!
<lb/>Our lives are but a jest! Unless the Almighty
<lb/>Shall save our souls and bodies from this scath
<lb/>We are but poised upon an eagle’s wings,
<lb/>Or struggling in the waters of the deep!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Like savage lions leaping from their lairs
<lb/>They charged together, while the sound of drum
<lb/>And pipe and clang of <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bells and gongs
<lb/>Rose from the foe, men could not see their reins,
<lb/>The horses' crests, or spear-points at their eyes.
<lb/><q>Ye have no room,</q> exclaimed Huimin, <q> for fight

<p><lb/>The din of mace and drum
<lb/>Reached the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host, and <persName>Giv</persName> and  <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>Returned not! Said Shidish and <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/>The Lion: <q> <persName>Tus</persName> is long engaged !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Guraza
<lb/>Said to <persName>Bizhan</persName>: <q>Our leader’s task is long!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Anon the din of drums rose from the plain,
<lb/>Air turned pitch-dark and earth to ebony.
<lb/>The warriors made toward the voice of <persName>Tus</persName>.
<lb/>The field ran blood. As they came up behind
<lb/>All drew their massive maces. Tuts, aware
<milestone unit="vullers" n="907"/>
<lb/>That succour had arrived, roared tymbal-like,

<lb/>His fortune rising, while <persName>Ruhham</persName> and Giy,
<lb/>Cheered by the voice of brave <persName>Bizhan</persName>, became
<lb/>Like lions. Thus they fought till break of day,
<lb/>Until the world’s Light shone above the mountains,
<lb/>Then they recalled the host and drew it off
<lb/>Toward the rocky heights. The chieftain <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>Harangued the troops: <q>From set of sun to drum-beat
<lb/>Far from the noble be the evil eye,
<lb/>And may our fighting end in festival.
<lb/>I never heard of warriors displaying
<lb/>Such gallantry as I have seen in you.
<lb/>My first prayer is that Holy God will keep
<lb/>Afar from us the eyes of evil ones.
<pb n="142"/>
<lb/>He is my refuge evermore and He
<lb/>Will take you out of this. I trust withal
<lb/>In Him that presently and swift as smoke
<lb/>AD army may come up to our support.
<lb/>Assuredly my speedy camel-post
<lb/>Hath reached ere now the monarch of the world.
<lb/>My letter will inflame his heart anew,
<lb/>The elephantine chief will come to aid us,
<lb/>And with a noble company of Lions.
<lb/>We shall return in triumph, well content,

<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName>, the chief of chieftains, loosed his tongue,

<lb/><q>Exalted one! our ancient state, I fear,
<lb/>Is tottering, whereat my heart is full
<lb/>Of dread. Thou fosterest the crown and throne,
<lb/>World-ruling fortune hath its light from thee,
<lb/>The heart of heaven is on thy sabre’s point,
<lb/>And under thee are sky and time and earth.
<lb/>Thou didst dig out the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>’s heart and brain ;
<lb/>The age’s hopes are based upon thy love,
<lb/>Earth is the servant of thy charger’s dust,
<lb/>And time to thee is like a loving mother.
<lb/>The sun is set a-burning by thy sword,
<lb/>And <rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs> weepeth at that mace of thine.
<lb/>Thy plumed and pointed shafts make lions weary
<lb/>Of fighting with thee on their day of bale.
<lb/>Since thou hast been a man and worn a helm
<lb/>No foe hath cast his eye upon <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>Now <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName> and other chiefs,
<lb/>With many of the warriors of this land,
<lb/>Have with full hearts and eyes that flowed with tears
<lb/>Fled from the soldiers of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>Full many of the kindred of <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>Fell on the day of fight and sleep in dust.
<lb/>Those of the army that escaped with life
<pb n="144"/>
<lb/>Are broken-hearted on <persName>Mount</persName> Hamdwan ;
<lb/>Their heads are lifted heavenward; they pray
<lb/>The Almighty, who is Lord of time and place,
<lb/>That elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> may perchance
<lb/>Come to them in God’s strength at my command.
<lb/>As I perused the letter in the night
<lb/>I shed my heart's blood freely on my cheeks.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="910"/>
<lb/>I told the thing to no one for three days
<lb/>Save only unto God the Succourer,
<lb/>But now, because the matter hath surpassed
<lb/>All bounds, my heart is full of care therefor.
<lb/>Thou art the hope of host and general :
<lb/>Mayst thou be sound in health and bright in mind;
<lb/>May thy head flourish and thy heart rejoice,
<lb/>Be thy pure person free from hurt of foe.
<lb/>Ask me for plenty of whate'er thou wilt,
<lb/>Of steeds, of arms, of treasure, and of troops.
<lb/>Go with good counsels and a joyful heart :
<lb/>So great a work must not be slackly done.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The hero answered: <q> May the signet-ring
<lb/>And crown ne'er lack thee. Heaven remembereth not
<lb/>A king like thee for <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, for stature, justice,
<lb/>And rede. <persName>Khusrau</persName> hath heard that ever since
<lb/>Kubdd assumed the imperial diadem
<lb/>I have been girded in <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> quarrels,
<lb/>And have not sat at rest a single day.
<lb/>Mine have been waste, gloom, lion, elephant,
<lb/>Enchanters, lusty dragons, mighty men
<lb/>Both of <placeName>Turan</placeName> and of <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,
<lb/>Dark nights, and massive maces, and withal
<lb/>Long journeyings and thirsts, for I preferred
<lb/>The door of travail to the stead of ease.
<lb/>So many toils and hardships have I seen
<lb/>That I have never asked a day of pleasure.
<lb/>Thou art the world’s king, and a slave am I
<lb/>Girt to perform thy hests. Let not the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<pb n="145"/>
<lb/>Grieve for the slain, but let thy foes look wan.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="911"/>
<lb/>With belted waist will I draw near to  <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>And gird me to avenge the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>For liver-wounded have I been and girt
<lb/>With mourning for the scions of <persName>Gudarz</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> heard <persName>Rustam</persName>’s words he wept,
<lb/>And said: <q> Without thee I desire not life,
<lb/>Or majesty or crown or royal throne.
<lb/>Now:be the welkin in thy lasso’s noose,
<lb/>And crowned heads in thy bonds.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The treasurer
<lb/>Unlocked the royal hoard of jewels, crowns,
<lb/>Dinars, helms, lassos, bows, and belts, oped too
<lb/>The sacks of drachms. The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> gave all to <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Thus saying: <q>O illustrious warrior !
<lb/>Go with the mace-men of <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>,
<lb/>And mighty men and warriors of <placeName>Kabul</placeName>,
<lb/>Swift as the blast, not tarrying thyself

<lb/>Said <persName>Fariburz</persName>, <q>I have a secret wish

<lb/>I cannot urge this, as thou know’st. Such speech

<lb/>The counsels most conformable with wisdom.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They went together to the moonlike dame—
<lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> and benignant <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>Who said to her: <q>Thou memory of my sire,

<lb/>Can say him nay when he requesteth aught.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> said to her: <q>O dame of dames,
<lb/>Extolled for spotless worth! Oh! may thy foes
<lb/>All perish! Thou, may be, wilt hear my counsel.
<lb/>Thou knowest that a woman cannot rest
<lb/>Without a spouse, the young without the young,
<lb/>And best of all a mate of Kaian race,
<lb/>For man is for the woman’s sake, and she
<lb/>Is far more eager than her spouse for her.

<lb/>Although there is none like him in <placeName>Iran</placeName>

<lb/>I must be girded to perform his will.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus, blushing like the roses in the spring,
<lb/>The monarch’s mother gave consent. The matter,
<lb/>Since <persName>Rustam</persName> was so instant, was soon sped:
<lb/>They called the archmages and drew up the contract. .
<lb/>Then <persName>Fariburz</persName> became <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s sire-in-law,
<lb/>And being franked by <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> and <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Increased his quality and dignity,
<lb/>And gained a robe of honour and new crown.<ref target="n.148.1"/>
<lb/>Three days prepared, the fourth achieved, the business,
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> with his gallant warriors
<lb/>Fared toward the plain, while <persName>Fariburz</persName> with troops
<lb/>Went in advance, resplendent as a star
<lb/>In heaven. Arose the din of clarions,

<lb/>And matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> led his army forth.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, the world-lord, with his mind all care,

<head>How <persName>Tus</persName> saw <persName>Siyawush</persName> in a Dream</head>
<p><lb/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="916"/>
<lb/>One night, about the hour of drum-beat, <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>Heart-seared and full of trouble, slept and dreamed
<lb/>That from the deep a radiant lustre rose
<lb/>About an ivory throne, and <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>Thereon with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and crown, with smiling lips
<lb/>And tongue fair-spoken, turned a sun-like face
<lb/>Upon him. <q>Stay the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> here,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>For thou shalt conquer in the fight. Lament not
<lb/>The kindred of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, for there is here
<lb/>A rosary all new, and we will quaff,
<lb/>How long we wot not, underneath its blooms.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With joyful heart released from pain and grief
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> woke. Then to <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q> World-paladin!
<lb/>I have beheld a vision in my sleep!
<lb/>Take note that <persName>Rustam</persName> like a rushing wind
<lb/>Will come anon !</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade the pipes to sound,
<lb/>The troops upon the mountain left their posts,
<lb/>The warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName> girt up their loins,
<lb/>And set up <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard, while <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>Upon the other side led forth his powers ;
<lb/>The dust-clouds dimmed the sun; its eye was dazed
<lb/>By warriors' shouts and by the rain of arrows.
<lb/>The two hosts met, but not a champion showed
<lb/>Before the lines. <persName>Human</persName> said to <persName>Piran</persName> :—
<lb/><q>We must attack. Why hesitate? The troops
<pb n="150"/>
<lb/>Are not out hunting. Man and beast bear weight.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said: <q>Peace! "Tis not the time for haste
<lb/>Or argument. Yestreen from yonder lines,
<lb/>And unawares, three with a paltry force
<lb/>Assailed us, hungry lions they, we sheep
<lb/>Whom cold is driving from the mountain-tops.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="917"/>
<lb/>I found the whole plain like a stream of blood,
<lb/>And famous heads laid low. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> hold
<lb/>A barren rock, their chargers sniff at thorns
<lb/>Like musk. Wait till they burn upon the crags,
<lb/>And die resourceless. Leave no way to pass,
<lb/>Side, front, or rear-ward. Since without your fighting
<lb/>The foe will come to hand, why change delay
<lb/>For haste? Why should we fight? Ten horse will serve
<lb/>As scouts upon the plain. Wait we until
<lb/>Our foes lack food and drink, and ask for quarter.
<lb/>Unless they can subsist on thorns and flints
<lb/>When provand faileth they will take to them
<lb/>And die.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They left the field, went to their tents,
<lb/>And scouts were posted while the warriors loosed
<lb/>Their belts and turned to sleep and banqueting.
<lb/>The chieftain <persName>Tus</persName> went also to his camp,
<lb/>With full heart and with cheeks of ebony,
<lb/>And thus addressed <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q> Affairs grow dark ;
<lb/>The fortunes of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> are distraught.
<lb/>Troops compass us, our beasts' feed is all thorny,
<lb/>And food is not o'er-plenteous with the host !
<lb/>Unsheathe at dawn. Rank on the mountain-skirts.
<lb/>If our good star prove helpful it will give us
<lb/>Our will upon our foes, while if the Judge
<lb/>Of heaven shall end us with the scimitar,
<lb/>No more or less can hap than His decree,
<lb/>So measure not your breaths in your dismay.
<lb/>Death too with high renown is goodlier

<lb/>When from the sign of Cancer Sol reached out,

<lb/>Came from the monarch to <persName>Piran</persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>Troops throng from every side—a host whose dust

<lb/>Upon the battle-day. A chief is there
<lb/>From Ma wara 'u'n-Nahr; his head is raised

<lb/>In height a cypress and in looks a moon,
<lb/>A potentate whose toys are crowns and thrones,
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName>, this chief of chiefs, will have his will
<lb/>Upon <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>. The troops comprise

<lb/>I reckon first the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, whose crown

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> harangued the army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>And said: <q> Ye chiefs and warriors of the king!
<lb/>Rejoice ye, young and old! at this good news,
<lb/>Sent by the king, and be ye bright of soul ;
<lb/>Now must we wash the trouble from our hearts.

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> laughed out with all his heart and soul,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said : <q> He that was dead reviveth !</q>
<lb/>Thus spake he to Human: <q>I will go forth
<lb/>To meet them. They have had a longsome march,
<lb/>Equipped for fight and full of care. They hold
<lb/>Their heads as high as doth <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>For they have treasure, lustre, throne, and state.

<lb/>And kiss the ground before his throne withal :

<lb/>Amidmost each enclosure was a standard

<lb/>He came afoot and kissed the ground before
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs>, who, seeing him, embraced him, marvelled

<p><lb/>He then asked: <q>Of the army of <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>Who hath the signet, and who hath the crown?

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>O monarch! live for ever,
<lb/>And may the Maker bless thee who hast joyed
<lb/>Thy slave’s heart with thy questions. Through thy fortune
<lb/>I am both well and happy, and my soul
<lb/>Desireth but the dust upon thy feet.
<lb/>The king inquireth of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>:
<lb/>They have no signet, diadem, or throne,
<lb/>And, having longed for war beyond all ineasure,
<lb/>Are left with only rocks to gaze upon ;
<lb/>For foiled, dishonoured, and reduced in strength,
<lb/>They went in full flight to <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName>.
<lb/>Their general is <persName>Tus</persName>, a man of valour,
<lb/>Who feareth not a lion in the field.
<lb/>Their chieftains are <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>,

<lb/>Now by the fortune of the illustrious <rs type="role">Khan</rs>
<lb/>This is the last host that their chief shall see.

<p><lb/>Thereat the paladin shed bitter tears,

<lb/>There will be generals while there are kings:

<p><lb/>The leader <persName>Tus</persName> laughed with the other chiefs,

<p><lb/>There rose a clamour from the camp-enclosure
<lb/>With sounds of kettledrum and clarion.
<lb/>They mounted seats upon five elephants,
<lb/>Housed with brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName> of turquoise hue,
<lb/>And broidered with gold thread. The seats themselves
<lb/>Were gemmed with emeralds, the fittings golden,
<lb/>The saddle-flaps were made of leopard-skin,
<pb n="161"/>
<lb/>And golden were bells, gongs, and rattle-boxes.
<lb/>The drivers' heads were decked with crowns, and all
<lb/>Wore torques and ear-rings. With so many flags
<lb/>Of painted silk the air was yellow, red,
<lb/>And violet like some bazar in <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>The troops marched to the field as if to keep
<lb/>A feast, the earth was beauteous as the eye
<lb/>Of chanticleer with trappings, colours, drums,
<lb/>And pipes. The kings set forth, the air was filled
<lb/>With blare of clarions, the spearpoints gleamed,
<lb/>The plain was black with troops. <persName>Tus</persName> from afar
<lb/>Saw them and ranged in line what men he had,
<lb/>The warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName> girt up their loins,
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName> brought <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard. From the plain
<lb/>Of battle to the summit of the mount
<lb/>The army of <placeName>Iran</placeName> stood troop on troop.
<lb/>Now when <persName>Kamus</persName> went forward with Manshur,
<lb/>Biward, Shangul the prescient, and the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>
<lb/>To view <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName>, they never thought
<lb/>To face a foe, but when the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> afar
<lb/>Looked forth and heard the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> horsemen’s war-cry
<lb/>It pleased him and he said: <q>Behold a host
<lb/>Of men-o'erthrowing, warlike cavaliers !
<milestone unit="vullers" n="929"/>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> the chieftain told us otherwise,
<lb/>But brave men’s qualities should not be hidden.
<lb/>The chieftain masketh the pit’s mouth with brambles,
<lb/>And thither will his horse speed at the chase.
<lb/>What better is it vainly to besmirch
<lb/>The foemen’s prowess on the day of fight ?
<lb/>I have not looked on cavaliers and chiefs
<lb/>So stamped with chivalry and manliness.</q>
<lb/><q>Men reck not of so few,</q> <persName>Piran</persName> replied,
<lb/><q>Upon a field like this.</q>
<lb/><q>But,</q> said the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>,
<lb/><q>What shall we do?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said: <q>Thou hast fared
<pb n="162"/>
<lb/>Far over hill and dale. Let us remain
<lb/>Three days to rest the troops. I will divide
<lb/>The host ; the day of fight and fear is over.
<lb/>Half of our warlike, glorious cavaliers
<lb/>Shall fall upon the foe from dawn till noon
<lb/>With double-pointed dart, sword, bow, and mace ;
<lb/>And then till night ariseth from the hills
<lb/>The other half shall strive. At dark will I
<lb/>Bring up the rested troops and press the foe ;
<lb/>We will not let them have a moment's peace—
<lb/>We and our eager cavaliers in arms.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> replied: <q> Not good! No such delay
<lb/>For me! With all these men and such strife toward
<lb/>Why seek so long a respite? Let us both
<lb/>Attack and straiten dale and height for them.
<lb/>Hence we will march upon <placeName>Iran</placeName>, will leave not
<lb/>Throne, crown, or diadem, lay waste all fields
<lb/>And fells, and act as warriors and Lions.
<lb/>No women, little children, old or young,
<lb/>No <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, or man of rank or paladin
<milestone unit="vullers" n="930"/>
<lb/>Will I leave in <placeName>Iran</placeName>, no field or fell,
<lb/>No hall or palace or four-footed beast.
<lb/>Why should we pass so many evil days
<lb/>To get but care and grief and needless pain ?
<lb/>But ope not to our foes a door to-night
<lb/>To get away. As soon as morning breatheth
<lb/>The troops must move. I with the king of <placeName>Hind</placeName>
<lb/>Will bear my flag up yonder height. To-morrow
<lb/>Thou shalt behold a heap of corpses there
<lb/>To make the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> weep that look thereon.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> said to <persName>Piran</persName>: <q> There is no course
<lb/>Save this: he is a peerless general.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The nobles all agreed to what Kimuis,
<lb/>The conqueror of Lions, had proposed.
<lb/>The conference being o'er they went their way,
<lb/>And passed all night in ordering their array.

<p><lb/>Said the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> :—

<lb/>Great men and Lions on the day of battle.
<lb/><q>A host,</q> they said, <q>arriveth from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said: <q>I have given up the throne

<lb/>For when I heard that from <placeName>Iran</placeName> a host

<lb/>My brain went, anguish filled my soul and head,

<p><lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName> said: <q> Why this grief? What need is there

<lb/>With all our soldiers, maces, elephants,

<lb/>Why fear then <persName>Rustam</persName>, <persName>Tus</persName>, and <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> ?
<lb/>What are the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> but as dust to us?

<lb/><q>The land is full of beat of kettledrum,

<p><lb/>He bade bring forth the drums, <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName>,
<lb/>Wherefrom shouts rose, grew ebon with dark dust,
<lb/>And earth shook underneath the trampling steeds.
<lb/>Then <persName>Tus</persName> harangued the troops, he spake at large
<lb/>About <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>, what <persName>Rustam</persName> did
<lb/>In battle with the divs, and how he triumphed.
<lb/>The soldiers called down blessings on their chief,
<lb/>They said: <q> Be ware of heart and bright of mind.
<lb/>We may pour out our souls at this good news,
<lb/>Which easeth them. When peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> cometh
<lb/>Yon host will not withstand the Crocodile.
<lb/>Then will we battle on this mount forthwith
<lb/>To cast this shame off from the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>.
<lb/>The standard of the illustrious <rs type="role">Khan</rs>, the crown,
<lb/>The golden shields, and throne of ivory,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="935"/>
<lb/>His elephant-attendants' crowns of gold,
<lb/>Their golden girdles and their golden torques,

<lb/>Of peacocks' tails, these will we seize, and more,
<lb/>When we are fighting with our lives at stake.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> said: <q> We are exposed to fear and blame ;
<lb/>Our foes surround the mount, our nobles' heads
<lb/>Are snared. When <persName>Rustam</persName> cometh he will speak
<lb/>Upbraidingly, not asking what hath chanced,
<lb/>And say: <q>Thou wast a bird caught in a net;
<lb/>The cause was sodden but the fight was raw.
<lb/>As with the general so with the host
<lb/>I have not seen one eager for the fray !</q>
<lb/>So let us charge like lions, and the foe
<lb/>May yet be shifted on this side the mount.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The troops replied to him: <q>Soar not so high.

<lb/>Ascended from the encampment of <persName>Kamus</persName>,
<lb/>That man-o'erthrowing chief who led the van.
<lb/>He massed his troops and gave out mail; his heart

<lb/>He changed his robe for armour, donned a helm
<lb/>Instead of crown, a breastplate for a tunic,
<lb/>And chose troops panoplied in steel and iron,

<lb/>Thou well mayst muse at one that shouldereth

<p><lb/>On his side <persName>Tus</persName> sent up
<lb/>The drum-roll to the clouds, he heard the watchman,
<lb/>His soul grew bright, he joyed, while from <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>A horseman sped to <persName>Fariburz</persName> to say :—
<lb/><q>The army of <placeName>Turan</placeName> arrayed for battle
<lb/>Is near at hand. They must not in full force
<lb/>Assail us scattered thus and overthrow us.
<lb/>Act as thy nature biddeth, for thou art

<p><lb/>Then <persName>Fariburz</persName> joined force with <persName>Tus</persName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="937"/>
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName>. They ranged the host on Hamdwan,
<lb/>And raised the glorious flag. All being ready,
<lb/>Right, left, and centre, rear and baggage-train,
<lb/>The clarions blared and all the host came on
<lb/>As 'twere the starry sky ; so when Kamas
<lb/>Advanced to fight he had no need to wait,
<lb/>But, like a river speeding down a height,
<lb/>Led on his troops and fronted <placeName>Hamawan</placeName>.
<lb/>Air was like indigo and earth was hidden.
<lb/>When he was near he faced toward the mount,
<lb/>And with his cheeks all smiles addressed his powers :—
<lb/><q>It is a coward’s business to oppose
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, yet a vast, brave host is here
<lb/>And not <persName>Piran</persName>, Human, and all that crew!
<lb/>What champion have they to contend with me?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then shouting to <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName> he cried :—
<lb/><q>Ye lion-men upon the day of battle!
<lb/>Behold my breast, my stature, and my bearing,
<lb/>This arm of mine, this sword and mace!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>On hearing, flared up, raged, and drew his sword,
<lb/>But said, when he drew nearer to <persName>Kamus</persName> :—
<pb n="170"/>
<lb/><q>None but a furious elephant can match him!</q>
<lb/>He took and strung his bow, he called on God,
<lb/>The Giver of all good, and showered arrows
<lb/>From bow like clouds in spring upon <persName>Kamus</persName>,
<lb/>Who, when he marked <persName>Giv</persName>'s mastery, concealed
<lb/>His own head 'neath his shield, and with his lance
<lb/>Charged wolf-like. Air was full of dust, and earth
<lb/>Of death. On drawing near his foe he speared

<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>’s waist, who reeled and, as he reeled, <persName>Kamus</persName>
<lb/>Plucked out his own sword, shouted, raged, proclaimed

<lb/>And clave his lance obliquely like a pen.
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> from the centre saw the fight with grief,
<lb/>And thought: <q><persName>Giv</persName> is not man enough ; I only

<p><lb/>He left the centre
<lb/>With shouts to succour <persName>Giv</persName> and join the fray.
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> wheeled, rode between the chiefs, and struck

<lb/>The charger fell, the gallant rider rose ;
<lb/>Then like a roaring lion took his stand,
<lb/>And on the battlefield with spear afoot
<lb/>Contended with <persName>Kamus</persName> before the hosts.
<lb/>Two noble warriors fought one cavalier ;

<lb/>Thus, till the sun’s place darkened, all the field

<p>
<lb/>Now when heaven's sphere grew void of sun and moon,

<lb/>The watcher in the look-out loosed his tongue :—
<lb/><q>The plain is full of dust, the night is dark,

<lb/>I grieved no longer for the dear ones gone ;
<lb/>Through thy good fortune only smiles remained.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> answered him: <q> Be glad of heart,
<lb/>And very heedful of thy noble self,
<lb/>Because the world is but deceit and toil,

<lb/>And gave much counsel, saying: <q> Ye chiefs! to-day
<lb/>A grave strife faceth us, and war’s result
<lb/>Is feast to one and funeral to another.</q></p>
<p><lb/>That warrior, that Lustre of the world,
<lb/>Set up his camp-enclosure while his powers
<lb/>Encamped behind him on <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName>,
<lb/>And raised their leader’s standard. Mighty <persName>Rustam</persName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="941"/>
<lb/>Sat on the throne and all the chiefs assembled.
<lb/>Here sat Giidarz and <persName>Giv</persName>, there <persName>Tus</persName> and others,
<lb/>While Rustain, with a lamp in front of him,
<lb/>Discoursed at large of matters great and small,
<lb/>How chiefs and troops had fought, and whether now
<lb/>Bright sun and shining moon would favour them.
<lb/>The chiefs spake to the gallant paladin
<lb/>Of that innumerable host of foes,
<lb/>Spake of Kimus, Shangul, the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>Manshur, and of the warriors of <placeName>Turan</placeName> :-—
<lb/><q>About Kimus himself we cannot speak,
<lb/>For we have had no means of seeing him.<ref target="n.172.1"/>
<lb/>He is a Tree whose Fruits are mace and sword,
<lb/>And, though the clouds rained stones upon his head,
<lb/>He would not flee from elephants of war:
<lb/>His head is full of wreak, his heart of strife.
<note n="172.1"><q>Car nous n'osons pas le regarder</q> (Mohl).</note>
<pb n="173"/>
<lb/>Earth is not able to contain Manshur;
<lb/>No warrior ordereth a host like him ;
<lb/>And froin this mountain to the river Shahd
<lb/>Stretch flags and litters, elephants and troops,
<lb/>Whose helimets and cuirasses pass compute.
<lb/>Grin are the looks of all upon the plain,
<lb/>Which is a mass of tents, around are pitched
<lb/>The tent-enclosures of brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>And had the captain and the host not come
<lb/>All had been lost. Praise to the Lord of victory,
<lb/>Who thus hath put a period to our stress !
<lb/>Past doubt we live through thee; we all despaired
<lb/>Of respite.</q></p>
<p><lb/>For a while the paladin
<lb/>Grieved for the slain, wept, and grew dark of soul,
<lb/>Then said: <q> Look from the orbit of the moon
<lb/>Down to the gloomy face of sombre earth ;
<lb/>All is distress and anguish, care and toil.
<lb/>Such is the manner of this Wayside Inn,
<lb/>Such is the manner of the circling sky—
<lb/>Whiles strife and poison, and whiles sweets and love!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="942"/>
<lb/>We die by nature or by violence ;
<lb/>'Tis better not to mark the why and how,
<lb/>For all must go as soon as time is up.
<lb/>Blame not the circling of the sky. Now may
<lb/>The all-victorious World-lord be our aid,
<lb/>And may our foemen’s fortunes be o'erthrown.
<lb/>Henceforward we will take our full revenge,
<lb/>And rid the world of foes.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The mighty men
<lb/>Praised him and said: <q> Live ever famed and glad
<lb/>With signet, crown, and sword, and never be
<lb/>The court of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> bereaved of thee.</q>

<head>How the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> and <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs> arrayed their Hosts</head>
<p>
<lb/>When o'er the hills the world-illumer shone,
<lb/>When day seized on the two dark curls of night,
<lb/>And, having cast aside its pitchy weeds,
<lb/>Bit with its teeth the moon’s lips till they bled,
<lb/>The sound of drums rose from the camp-enclosures,
<lb/>The warriors came forth. <persName>Human</persName> the chieftain
<lb/>Went out to reconnoitre every side,
<lb/>And thought: <q> What reinforcement have the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>To need those tents and those pavilions?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He saw a camp-enclosure of brocade
<lb/>Of turquoise hue with many slaves about,
<lb/>And in its front a general's flag and spear:
<lb/>It seemed to him that fortune had changed sides.
<lb/>He saw another army’s camp-enclosure
<lb/>With flags as bright as moons, for <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>Son of <persName>Kaus</persName>, with elephants and drums
<lb/>Had pitched near <persName>Tus</persName>. <persName>Human</persName> in deep concern
<lb/>Went to <persName>Piran</persName> and said: <q>To-day is wedded
<lb/>To heavy toil. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>' cries and clamour
<lb/>Were greater yesternight than heretofore ;
<lb/>So went I forth alone from camp at dawn,
<lb/>And viewed the foe on all sides. From <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>A mighty host hath come to succour them.
<lb/>Now one pavilion is of green brocade ;
<lb/>Its standard hath a dragon for device,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="943"/>
<lb/>And soldiers from <placeName>Zabul</placeName> are round about
<lb/>With bucklers and with falchions of <placeName>Kabul</placeName>.
<lb/>I think that <persName>Rustam</persName>, sent forth by the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>Hath come with reinforcements to the field.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> made answer: <q>Tis an evil time!
<lb/>If <persName>Rustam</persName> taketh part in this campaign
<lb/>He will not spare <persName>Kamus</persName>, the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<pb n="175"/>
<lb/>Shangul or any warrior of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With that he left the camp and going forth
<lb/>Observed the forces of the foe, and thence
<lb/>Came hurrying to <persName>Kamus</persName>, came to Manshur
<lb/>And to Fartus, and said: <q>I went this morn,
<lb/>And made the circuit of the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host.
<lb/>Great reinforcements have arrived and chiefs
<lb/>Both numerous and eager for the fray.
<lb/>Methinketh too that elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Of whom I spake before the company,
<lb/>Hath come to succour them, all bent on vengeance,
<lb/>Straight from the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.</q>
<lb/><q>O wise one!</q> said <persName>Kamus</persName>,
<lb/><q>Thy heart produceth naught but ill surmise.
<lb/>Know thou that <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> hath come to war,
<lb/>But do not therefore vex thy heart in vain.
<lb/>Why harp so much on <persName>Rustam</persName>? Name no more
<lb/><placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>. If he beholdeth me
<lb/>With flag in hand his heart will mourn at fight.
<lb/>Go thou, array the host, lead forth the troops,
<lb/>And bring the standards to the battlefield.
<lb/>When I go forth to combat with the host
<lb/>Ye must not loiter. Now shalt thou behold

<milestone unit="vullers" n="944"/>
<lb/>The paladin
<lb/>Rejoiced to hear and ceased to fret at <persName>Rustam</persName>.
<lb/>He came with joyful heart and resolute,
<lb/>And bathed his spirit in the stream of valour.
<lb/>He gave out helms and mail to all the troops,
<lb/>And kept in mind the language of <persName>Kamus</persName>,
<lb/>Then going to the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> he kissed the ground,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>O monarch, live for ever!
<lb/>May wisdom feed upon thy thoughts. The way
<lb/>That thou hast trod was long and difficult ;
<lb/>Thou boughtest toil, foregoing feasts for us,
<pb n="176"/>
<lb/>And to do reverence to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Hast crossed the sea.<ref target="n.176.1"/> Our soldiers' backs are straight- ened
<lb/>By thee. Now act as native worth requireth,
<lb/>Bedeck the elephants with bells and gongs,
<lb/>And stun the world with blare of clarions.
<lb/>To-day I make the attack; do thou remain
<lb/>At the army’s centre with the elephants
<lb/>And kettledrums, keep guard upon my rear,
<lb/>And help to raise my helmet to the clouds.
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> said thus to me: <q> Lead thou the van,</q>
<lb/>And brandishing his mace swore many oaths,
<lb/>And said: <q>I will not fight save with this mace
<lb/>To-day though stones should shower from the clouds.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> on hearing bade the clarions sound :
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The very dust hath feet!</q>
<lb/>Both earth and heaven shook at the tymbal-din,
<lb/>And put all love away. He gave command
<lb/>To set a litter on an elephant,
<lb/>And earth’s face seemed like indigo. He reached
<lb/>In state the army’s centre, and the sky
<lb/>Was like a dark cloud with the flying dust.
<lb/>There was a sound of gongs and <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bells,
<lb/>And thou hadst said: <q>Men’s hearts are in their mouths !</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="945"/>
<lb/>The many turquoise thrones upon the backs
<lb/>Of elephants and that blue sea of flags
<lb/>Took all the lustre from the eyes of men,
<lb/>And none possessed his soul in quietude.
<lb/>Dust filled the eyes and gullet of the sky:
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Its face is smeared with pitch !</q>
<lb/>Now when the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> had reached the army’s centre
<lb/>The moon went erring from its way in heaven.
<lb/>The right led by <persName>Kamus</persName> was like a mountain ;

<lb/>They took the baggage-train toward the waste.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> went toward the left wing, and with him
<lb/>There went Humdan his brother and <persName>Kulbad</persName>.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> saw the movements of the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>
<lb/>He too arrayed his troops, bade <persName>Tus</persName> bind on
<lb/>The drums and dress the army like the eye
<lb/>Of chanticleer. He said: <q> We shall behold
<lb/>O'er whom the heaven turneth in its love,
<lb/>What are the revolutions of the sky,
<lb/>And which of these great men hath lived his time.
<lb/>I loitered not, <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> made three stages one,
<lb/>But now his hoofs are tired; he is o'erwrought
<lb/>By march and toil. I dare not tax his strength
<lb/>By going forth myself as challenger ;
<lb/>Assist me then to-day and work your will
<lb/>Upon the foe.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The captain of the host
<lb/>Struck up the fifes and drums; the war-cry rose,
<lb/>And trumpet-blare. <persName>Gudarz</persName> drew up the right,
<lb/>And sent the baggage to <persName>Mount</persName> <placeName>Hamawan</placeName>,
<lb/>While Fartburz arrayed the left ; the world
<lb/>Seemed all a reed-bed! At the army’s centre
<lb/>Was <persName>Tus</persName> son of <persName>Naudar</persName>. Earth was all dust,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="946"/>
<lb/>And air all storm, so that the world was hidden;
<lb/>The warriors could not even see themselves !
<lb/>The mighty <persName>Rustam</persName> climbed the heights to view
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> and army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>; he saw
<lb/>A host so mighty that the sea of Rim
<lb/>Seemed but a lump of wax compared to them !
<lb/>The troops were from Kashan and Shakn and Wahr,
<lb/>With divers coats of mail and divers helms,

<lb/>Gahan and <placeName>Rum</placeName>, <placeName>Sind</placeName> and the Indus-banks.<ref target="n.177.1"/>

<lb/>The adornments of the thrones of ivory,
<lb/>The armlets and tiaras, torques and crowns,
<lb/>The world was like the garth of Paradise—
<lb/>A goodly but terrific spectacle !
<lb/>He stood astonied on the height and thought :—
<lb/><q>When will the sky show love to us again ?
<lb/>What will the next jest of old heaven be ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He gat down from the mount but lost not heart,
<lb/>Went not before the army and its chief,
<lb/>But said: <q>Since first I girt me ne'er have I
<lb/>Dwelt anywhere a year, and I have seen
<lb/>Full many a host, but greater never saw.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade advance the drums, and <persName>Tus</persName> the general
<lb/>Marched from the mountain to the plain to battle,
<lb/>Prepared to dip his wreakful spear in blood.
<lb/>They marched till noon, then ranked them two leagues long,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="947"/>
<lb/>The daylight vanished in the army’s dust,
<lb/>The sun divided not 'twixt night and day,

<lb/>The sun became confounded, and the din

<lb/>Rose over <rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs> and <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs>. Rocks of flint

<lb/>Both sword and forearm reddened o'er with blood,
<lb/>The ground groaned underneath the horses' shoes :
<lb/>The body of the coward lost all heart,
<lb/>While brave men turned their mail to winding-sheets.
<lb/>Kamius addressed the host : <q> Since we must tread
<lb/>The sky to-day, bring all your lassos, maces,

<lb/>A warrior named Ashkabus, whose voice

<lb/>In dust. He cried: <q> Which of you famous men
<lb/>Will come to fight with me, that 1 may make

<milestone unit="vullers" n="948"/>
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> on hearing
<lb/>Sent up his battle-cry, stormed like the sea,
<lb/>Took up his bow—-the horseman’s ambuscade—
<lb/>And showered arrows on that famous chief,
<lb/>But he was clad in panoply of steel,
<lb/>And arrows were like wind upon his tunic.
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> then raised his massive mace. The hands
<lb/>Of both grew weary, but Ruhhd4m’s mace failed
<lb/>Upon the other's helm, much as he sought
<lb/>To deal a fatal blow, till Ashkabus,
<lb/>His heavy mace in hand, while earth seemed iron
<lb/>And heaven ebony, smote brave Ruhh4m
<lb/>Upon the helm and smashed it, who thus worsted
<lb/>Wheeled round and sought the heights. Tuts at the centre
<lb/>Raged and spurred forth to go at Ashkabus,
<lb/>But matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> said to him in wrath :—
<lb/><q>Rubham’s fit comrade is a bowl of wine.
<lb/>He holdeth swords as playthings in his cups,
<lb/>And vaunteth of himself among the brave ;
<lb/>Now whither hath he gone, who was a match
<lb/>For Ashkabius, with cheeks like sandarach ?
<lb/>Keep in the army’s centre—thy fit place—
<lb/>And I will fight afoot.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He slung his bow
<lb/>Upon his arm, stuck arrows in his belt,
<pb n="180"/>
<lb/>And shouted, saying: <q>O thou man of war!
<lb/>Thine adversary cometh: go not back.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He of Kashan laughed in astonishment,
<lb/>Then checked his steed and, calling to his foe,
<lb/>Said, laughing still, to him: <q> What is thy name,
<lb/>And who will mourn thee when thy head is off?</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="949"/>
<lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> answered: <q> Hapless one!
<lb/>Why askest thou my name among the folk ?
<lb/>My mother called me by this name—<q> Thy death !</q>
<lb/>Fate made me for the hammer of thy helm.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He of Kashan replied: <q> Without a horse
<lb/>Thou givest up thyself to slaughtering !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>Senseless challenger !
<lb/>Hast thou ne'er seen foot-soldiers lay proud heads
<lb/>Beneath the stones? Do lions, crocodiles,
<lb/>And leopards fight on horseback in thy country ?
<lb/>Now I, foot-soldier as I am, will teach
<lb/>Thee how to fight, O mounted warrior !
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> for this purpose sent me forth afoot
<lb/>That I might get a horse from Ashkabus.
<lb/>He of Kashan like me will foot it then,
<lb/>And all will laugh at him. Afoot one man
<lb/>Is worth three hundred cavaliers like thee
<lb/>Upon this plain, this day, and in this fight.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He of Kashan inquired: <q> Where are thine arms?
<lb/>I see not aught but mockery and jests.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Quoth <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>Thou shalt see the bow and arrows
<lb/>Whereby thy life shall end.</q>
<lb/>He marked the pride
<lb/>Of Ashkabits in his fine steed, and shot
<lb/>An arrow at its breast; the charger fell
<lb/>Headforemost. <persName>Rustam</persName> laughed and cried aloud :—
<lb/><q>Sit by thy noble comrade! Prithee nurse
<lb/>Its head and rest thee from the fight awhile.</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="950"/>
<p>
<lb/>Then Ashkabis, his body quivering,

<pb n="181"/>
<lb/>And showered shafts on <persName>Rustam</persName>, who exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>In vain thou weariest thy wicked soul,

<p><lb/>Choosing from his girdle
<lb/>A shaft of poplar wood he drew it forth
<lb/>Bright-pointed, feathered with four eagle-plumes ;
<lb/>Then took his bow of <placeName>Chach</placeName> in hand and set
<lb/>His thumbstall to the deer-hide string; he straightened
<lb/>His left arm, curved his right; the bent bow sang;
<lb/>The shaft’s point reached his ear; the deer-hide hummed ;
<lb/>The shaft’s point bussed his finger and its notch
<lb/>Was at his back; he loosed and struck the breast
<lb/>Of Ashkabus; the sky kissed <persName>Rustam</persName>’s hand ;

<lb/>The heavens cried: <q> Excellent!</q> the angels: <q>Good!</q>

<lb/>He spake thus to <persName>Piran</persName>: <q> Who is this man ?

<lb/><q>They are a paltry remnant,</q> were thy words,

<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> went full of care and pale of face

<lb/><q>Wise men do not depreciate their foes.
<lb/>The nobles of <placeName>Iran</placeName> are in good heart ;
<lb/><q>They would break iron,</q> thou may’st say; and now
<lb/>That reinforcements reach them from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>They raise their war-cry on the battlefield.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q> Whatever cavalier
<lb/>Shall come forth from <placeName>Iran</placeName> to succour  <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>We need not fear if <persName>Rustam</persName> be away.
<lb/>I shall not break my heart about Ruhhim
<lb/>Or yet about <persName>Gurgin</persName> ; for be assured

<lb/>So harmful in the infliction of these wounds.</q></p>
<pb n="183"/>
<p><lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> replied: <q>Our fight to-day was such
<lb/>That fame was turned to shame since Ashkabus
<lb/>Was slain therein while <persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName> rejoiced.
<lb/>My heart was riven at this man on foot
<lb/>Because our troops were panic-stricken at him.
<lb/>He is the tallest man on earth, we have not
<lb/>One in the host to fight him. Thou didst see
<lb/>His bow; the shaft is here. A savage lion
<lb/>Hath not his strength; he surely is the warrior,

<lb/>What sort of man is he, and what his aspect ?
<lb/>On what wise shall I go to combat with him,
<lb/>For if he be the one that hath arrived
<lb/>I take the field myself?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied :-—
<lb/><q>Forbid it, heaven! that <persName>Rustam</persName> should come hither,
<lb/>And purpose fight! Thou wouldest see a hero,
<lb/>Tall as a cypress, and with <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and beauty,
<lb/>From whom Afrasiyib on many a field
<milestone unit="vullers" n="953"/>
<lb/>Hath turned with tears; a warrior-liege is he,
<lb/>The first to draw the scimitar, and fighteth
<lb/>In wreak for <persName>Siyawush</persName> his foster-child.
<lb/>No one can wield his arms though many try.
<lb/>In battle, when he girdeth up his loins,
<lb/>His body hath a savage lion’s strength.
<lb/>No crocodile can lift his mace when dropped
<lb/>In fight; his bow-string is of lion-hide ;
<pb n="184"/>
<lb/>His arrows, shaft and point, weigh ten sitir.
<lb/>If any flint-rock should encounter him
<lb/>'Twould turn to wax or something softer still.
<lb/>He weareth, when he goeth forth to battle,
<lb/>Chain-mail, and buckleth o'er it his cuirass,
<lb/>And over that a garb of leopard-skin.
<lb/><q>Babr-i-Bayiin</q> he calleth it; "tis more
<lb/>Than tunic and cuirass to him, not burning
<lb/>With fire and wetting not with water. He
<lb/>Hath wings when wearing it. The steed whereon
<lb/>He rideth is, thou wouldst say, <persName>Mount</persName> Bistun
<lb/>In motion, ever neighing in the fight,
<lb/>And making sparks fly out of dust and stone;
<lb/>But, wondrous as he is, it well may be
<lb/>That thou wilt hold him not a man in battle,
<lb/>And 'tis not strange that thou art worshipful
<lb/>Who hast such limbs and shoulders, neck and arms.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Whenas <persName>Kamus</persName>, the man so prudent, heard
<lb/>He gave his eyes and ears up to <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>Whose words in sooth proved grateful. All afire
<lb/>He answered: <q> Paladin! be shrewd of heart
<lb/>And bright of mind. Propose what oaths thou wilt—
<lb/>Oaths such as kings of wakeful fortune take—
<lb/>And I will swear a greater oath to thee,

<lb/>In His strength Who is Master of the sun,

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> called many blessings down on him,

<lb/>We are in all things subject to thy will,

<head>How the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> and <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs> set the Battle in Array</head>
<p>
<lb/>Whenas the air glowed with the setting sun,
<lb/>And dark night 'gan to stalk athwart the sky,
<lb/>The warriors of the army of <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>The men of wisdom and the scimitar,
<lb/>Came in a body to the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>’s pavilion,
<lb/>Full of revenge and fight—the lion-man
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName>, the conqueror of elephants,
<lb/>Manshir the brave, the arbiter of battle,
<lb/>With Shamfran from Shakn, Shangul from <placeName>Hind</placeName>,
<lb/>The king of <placeName>Sind</placeName> and from Saklab Kundur.
<lb/>They all advised at large about the war,
<lb/>And spake much of <placeName>Iran</placeName>, till all agreed
<lb/>That they must wash their hands in blood, then parted,
<lb/>Each to his tent, for rest or pleasure there ;
<lb/>But when the moon, then slender grown and humped,
<lb/>Left the dark chevelure of gloomy night,
<lb/>And, being in the presence of the sun,
<lb/>Arose with watery looks and bathed its cheeks,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="955"/>
<lb/>The soldiers of both hosts began to stir,
<lb/>And, as their shouts arose, the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Exclaimed: <q>We must not hesitate to fight
<lb/>As yesterday we did and had to deem
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>—the man most needful—non-existent.
<lb/>Far have we marched with succours to this war,
<lb/>And if we slack to-day as yesterday
<lb/>We shall disgrace our name for manliness.
<lb/>To-morrow too <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will praise us,
<lb/>And we may rest. Attack we then in force,
<lb/>And mountain-like advance against our foes;
<lb/>The nobles of ten provinces are here,
<lb/>We must not sleep or feast.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The mighty men
<pb n="186"/>
<lb/>Arose and said: <q>The conduct of the host
<lb/>Is thine to-day. Thine are the realms of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>And of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>. <rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs> thou here to-day
<lb/>How scimitars shall shower from darksome clouds!</q></p>
<p><lb/>On his side <persName>Rustam</persName> thus harangued the troops :—
<lb/><q>The time hath come; if we have lost a few
<lb/>There is but one in several hundred slain ;
<lb/>Let not your hearts be straitened ; for my part
<lb/>I will not live except with fame and honour.
<lb/>With cheeks like ebony the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> troops
<lb/>Withdrew from Ashkabts, so fill ye, all!
<lb/>Your hearts with vengeance, frown, ye cavaliers !
<lb/>For I have put the shoes on <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> to-day,

<p><lb/>He donned his armour and went forth

<lb/>He put his chain-mail under his cuirass,
<lb/>And over it he donned Babr-i-Bayan.
<lb/>He wore a helmet wrought of steel of <placeName>Chin</placeName>—
<lb/>One to make foemen meditate on death.
<lb/>He girded up his loins by God’s command,

<head>How Alwa was slain by <persName>Kamus</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>The drums and trumpets sounded from both hosts,
<lb/>No room remained for guile or grammarye ;
<lb/>The mountains and the plains were all a-quake,
<lb/>The earth was troubled by the tramp of steeds.
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> commanded the <rs type="ethnic">Turanian</rs> right,
<lb/>Behind him were the mighty elephants
<lb/>And baggage. On the left the lord of <placeName>Hind</placeName>
<lb/>Stood clad in mail, a Riman sword in hand,
<lb/>And in the centre was the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>The sky grew dark, the earth shook. <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/>Like Sol irradiant in Aries,
<lb/>Commanded on the left wing of <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName>, son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, encased in steel,
<lb/>Was on the right, and in the centre <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>Son of <persName>Naudar</persName>, in front were drums and clarions.
<lb/>From all parts of the host a shout arose—
<lb/>A shout which rent the ears of elephants—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="957"/>
<lb/>And e'er from water rose the fumes of fire:
<lb/>It was a fight surpassing warriors' dreams.
<lb/>The first man that appeared between the lines,
<lb/>His heart’s blood all afoam upon his lips,
<lb/>Was that famed chief <persName>Kamus</persName> accompanied
<lb/>By soldiers, elephants, and kettledrums.
<lb/>He, bearing in his hand an ox-head mace,
<lb/>Cried like a furious elephant trumpeting :—
<lb/><q>Where is that man on foot who challengeth
<lb/>Illustrious heroes? Let him come and see
<lb/>A bow and arrow that will cost him life.</q>
<lb/>The gallant warriors—illustrious <persName>Tus</persName>,
<lb/>Ruhbam, and <persName>Giv</persName>—beheld <persName>Kamus</persName>, but none
<lb/>Desired to strive with him; the field remained
<lb/>Void of <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> chiefs; none had the strength
<pb n="188"/>
<lb/>To fight with him for he was like a pard ;
<lb/>They were like deer. Yet was there one, Alwa,
<lb/>A Zabulf, who promptly drew his sword.
<lb/>He used to bear the spear and guard the back
<lb/>Of <persName>Rustam</persName>, was a skilful cavalier,
<lb/>And had with liver-burning toil and trouble
<lb/>Acquired from him the uso of arrow, mace,
<lb/>And spear. What said the sage, the eloquent,
<lb/>The ancient man? Now listen and perpend :—
<lb/><q>Let not thy prowess fill thee with conceit,
<lb/>But look well to the ground beneath thy feet ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="958"/>
<lb/>To match a rivulet against the sea
<lb/>Would be a contest of insanity.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now when Alwa adventured on Kamiis,
<lb/>Who for his part was eager for the fray,
<lb/>They cleared an ample space. He of Kashan
<lb/>Came wolf-like, with his spear unhorsed his foe
<lb/>With ease, then wheeled his steed and trampled o'er
<lb/>The fallen till the dust was red with gore.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<head>How <persName>Kamus</persName> was slain by <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> grieved about Alwa,
<lb/>Let loose the twisted lasso from its straps,
<lb/>And took his massive mace as for a strife
<lb/>Of chiefs. He roared like some mad elephant
<lb/>As he advanced with lasso on his arm
<lb/>And mace in hand. <persName>Kamus</persName> said: <q> Bluster not
<lb/>So much about a thread of sixty coils.</q>
<lb/><q>The lion roareth bravely,</q> <persName>Rustam</persName> said,
<lb/><q>On catching sight of game. Thou wast the first
<lb/>To put the girdle on in this dispute,
<lb/>And thou hast slain a noble of <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>Thou sayest that my lasso is a thread ;
<pb n="189"/>
<lb/>Now shalt thou see how tight the knots will hold.
<lb/>Thy fate doth drive thee on, man of Kashan!
<lb/>Since here no place is left thee save the dust.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> the valiant urged his dun steed on,
<lb/>His foe a lasso-bearing Elephant,
<lb/>And let out with his glittering glaive, intent
<lb/>To sever <persName>Rustam</persName>’s head. The point alighted
<lb/>On <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>’s neck and clave the battle-mail,
<lb/>But failed to wound. The elephantine hero
<milestone unit="vullers" n="959"/>
<lb/>Coiled, whirled, and flung the lasso round his foe,
<lb/>Then spurred away and made the leather fast
<lb/>Beneath his thigh while <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> flew eagle-like.
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> undaunted tightly gripped his steed,
<lb/>Pressed firmly on the stirrups, loosed the reins,
<lb/>And sought by force to break the twisted thong,
<lb/>Becoming frantic, but the raw hide held.
<lb/>The elephantine hero, checking <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>Wheeled, jerked Kamius headforemost to the ground,
<lb/>Came up, secured him in the lasso’s coils,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>Thou art not dangerous now.
<lb/>In vain are all thy charms and spells; thy soul
<lb/>Hath made a fruitless bargain with the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bound his prisoner’s hands behind the back,
<lb/>Firm as a rock, then grasped the coils, returned
<lb/>Afoot, his foe beneath his arm, and told
<lb/>The warriors : <q> This lover of the fray
<lb/>Essayed to match himself with me in strength,
<lb/>But 'tis the wont with this deceitful world
<lb/>At times to elevate, at times bring low.
<lb/>It causeth both our happiness and grief,
<lb/>And one is whiles on earth, whiles in the clouds.
<lb/>Now this illustrious warrior, who ever
<lb/>Was wont to prove the lion’s match in fight,
<lb/>Set forth to desolate <placeName>Iran</placeName>, to make
<lb/>A den of lions of our fields and fells,
<lb/>And leave behind no palaces or bowers
<pb n="190"/>
<lb/>Of roses in <placeName>Zabul</placeName> or in <placeName>Kabul</placeName>.
<lb/>He would not lay aside that mace of his
<lb/>Till he had slaughtered <persName>Rustam</persName> son of Zial;
<lb/>But now his helm and hauberk are his shroud,
<lb/>His crown is dust, and his juppon the grave.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="960"/>
<lb/>On what wise do ye purpose slaying him,
<lb/>Because <persName>Kamus</persName> the warrior’s work is done?</q>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> flung <persName>Kamus</persName> upon the ground
<lb/>Before the chiefs; the warriors left their ranks,
<lb/>They hacked his body with their scimitars,
<lb/>And drenched the stones and dust beneath with blood.
<lb/>Such is the course of heaven and destiny,
<lb/>Now causing joy, then pain and misery !
<lb/>All is toil, anguish, trouble, and distress ;
<lb/>Thy courage will not make it more or less.
<lb/>Thy body hath a load of guilt to bear,
<lb/>Thy spirit dwelleth in a world of care ;
<lb/>And let not bravery thy thoughts elate,
<lb/>For stretched above thee is the hand of Fate.
<lb/>With all thy might incline to virtue’s ways,
<lb/>And offer unto God—the Guide—thy praise.
<lb/>The strife with brave <persName>Kamus</persName> hath reached its goal
<lb/>In death when He that gave took back the soul.
<lb/>Now valour and revenge will fill the scene:

Gurgan—refused to be present because, he said, <persName>Firdausi</persName>, though a learned and religious man, had deserted his principles and spent his time in discoursing of men of bad religion and fire-worshippers.
That night the Shaikh had a dream of Paradise. He saw a magnificent palace with a jewelled throne, and asked whose it was, <q>It is for <persName>Firdausi</persName>,</q> was the reply. Then the poet appeared wearing a green robe and an emerald-coloured crown upon his head. <q>O <persName>Firdausi</persName>!</q> said the Shaikh, <q>whence this rank and splendour?</q> The poet answered: <q>From a couplet or two con- fessing the Unity of God.</q> The Shaikh, when he woke, went and prayed at <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s tomb.

<lb/>Upon the field, and day is turned to gloom
<lb/>And bitterness before the chiefs of Balkh,

<p><lb/>All looked on one another,

<p><lb/>Thus to Human the Lion spake, <persName>Piran</persName> :—
<lb/><q>My soul hath had enough of strife to-day.
<lb/>How shall our warriors desire to fight
<lb/>When our brave Crocodile hath just been slain ?
<lb/>He was a peerless noble; not a horseman
<lb/>Had form more elephantine, and the man
<lb/>That could in battle bind him with the lasso
<lb/>Might well in days of fight seize by the head
<lb/>An elephant and dash it to the ground.</q>

<lb/>The troops in sore distress about <persName>Kamus</persName>
<lb/>Came in a body weeping to the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>,
<lb/>To whom <persName>Piran</persName> did reverence sadly, saying :—
<lb/><q>O thou exalted o'er yon azure dome!
<lb/>Thou hast beheld and heard how we have fared
<lb/>From first to last upon this battlefield.
<lb/>Devise a remedy for our misfortune
<lb/>Thyself without consulting any one.
<lb/>Choose from our army’s spies one that can bring
<lb/>Hid things to light and find out who he is—
<lb/>This lion-hearted one for whom our host
<lb/>Hath not a match; then we will all face death,
<lb/>And fight him on the field.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> replied :—
<q>'Tis what concerneth me; I fain would know
<milestone unit="vullers" n="962"/>
<lb/>The name of this pernicious paladin,
<lb/>Who taketh Lions in his lasso’s coils;
<lb/>But seeing death may not be remedied,
<lb/>And wishes, prayers, and vigour naught avail,
<lb/>For to that end we all are mother-born,
<lb/>And yield our necks thereto against our wills,

<p><lb/>He then assembled

<lb/>Tis needful that ye spy out where he is

<lb/>A lusty cavalier—a faithful liege—

<lb/>A man of valour and adventurous,
<lb/>Stepped forth and volunteered. He thus addressed
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs>: <q>Exalted! all the world would have
<lb/>Thy love. Though this man be a lion I
<lb/>Will make him lifeless when I take the field,
<lb/>Will fight him single-handed and convert

<lb/>I will be foremost to avenge Kimius,

<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> applauded him. He kissed the ground

<p><lb/>Chingish spurred forth swift as <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>,
<lb/>Approached the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, drew a poplar arrow,
<lb/>And cried: <q>This is my field, the heads of nobles

<lb/>That insolent came wind-like, strung his bow,
<lb/>Which seemed a raining cloud, and said to <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>His mail-clad opposite: <q>Stay, valiant horseman!
<lb/>Thou shalt have fight enough.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The other raised
<lb/>His shield, perceiving that the shafts would pierce

<lb/>His mail. Chingish marked well that elephant-form,
<lb/>Tall as a straight-stemmed cypress in a garden,
<lb/>Beheld that steed—a Hill beneath a Hill
<lb/>And not aweary—thought: <q>To run away
<lb/>Is better than to bring myself to harm,</q>
<lb/>And spurred his heavy-laden charger on
<lb/>In flight, intending to rejoin his troops ;
<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName>, that bold horseman, urged on <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>Like fire and followed up his noble foe.
<lb/>As like a furious elephant he gained
<lb/>Upon Chingish the plain was full of hubbub,
<lb/>And both the armies saw amazedly

<lb/>Send all to us, and I will wish no longer
<lb/>To fight the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>; ye shall be my friends
<lb/>In all, I will not speed revenge, seek strife,
<lb/>Or lay the heads of nobles in the dust.
<lb/>I will communicate with <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>Will purge his heart and brain of grief and vengeance,
<lb/>And send to him the culprits; he may pity them,
<lb/>And pardon their offence. Now will I tell thee
<lb/>Their names, and may their names and schemes both perish !
<lb/>The head of the offence was <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>,
<lb/>Who sought to trouble and afflict <placeName>Iran</placeName> ;
<lb/>Next any that thou knowest of <persName>Tur</persName>’s seed
<lb/>That made this Water brackish wantonly,
<lb/>Such as Gurwi the son of Zira, born
<lb/>Unjust and loveless ; perish all his race!
<lb/>They did the injury to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>Which was the key to all these bonds of bale ;
<lb/>Next those who wrecked their monarch’s brain and heart,
<lb/>And made blood flow like water, also those
<lb/>Who had no quarrel with the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>And yet have taken part in this campaign,
<lb/>The mighty men that are of <persName>Wisa</persName>’s race,
<lb/>Men double-faced and pied to every one,
<pb n="198"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="967"/>
<lb/>Such as <persName>Human</persName>, Lahhak, and Farshidward,
<lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName> and Nastihan the lion-man.
<lb/>If ye accomplish this that I demand,
<lb/>And end our quest for vengeance, I will shut
<lb/>The door of our revenge upon thy country ;
<lb/>Thou shalt not need to clothe thy breast in mail ;
<lb/>But if thou speakest in another sense
<lb/>I will renew our quarrel by fresh wars,
<lb/>And by the life and head of great <persName>Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>Make reek the marches of Turin. Shangul
<lb/>Shall not survive nor yet the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>Or warrior of the country of <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>Thou hast essayed me on this battlefield ;
<lb/>My way and mode of fight is always this.
<lb/>One of the nobles of <placeName>Iran</placeName> am I,
<lb/>Wont to encounter Lions in the fray,
<lb/>And many heads have I removed from bodies
<lb/>Whose only winding-sheet was grimy dust.
<lb/>I ne'er have spoken on this wise before,
<lb/>My purpose first and last hath been revenge;
<lb/>Now therefore hearken to me and embrace
<lb/>These fair proposals.</q></p>
<p><lb/>At these words <persName>Human</persName>
<lb/>Was sore afraid and trembled like a leaf,
<lb/>For hearing <persName>Rustam</persName> talk in such a strain
<lb/>He saw what vengeance would befall his kin,
<lb/>And answered: <q> Lion-hearted warrior!
<lb/>With strength and form and stature such as thine
<lb/>Thy proper seat is on the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> throne.
<lb/>At least thou art a mighty paladin
<lb/>Or some redoubtable <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> chief.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="968"/>

<lb/>Thou hast inquired about my race and name,
<lb/>But not accorded what I asked of thee.
<lb/>My name is Kuh. A warrior brave am I.
<lb/>My sire is Busipas—the lion-like.
<lb/>I have accompanied this host from far,
<pb n="199"/>
<lb/>And come a soldier to this scene of strife.
<lb/>Now that thou hast my name and race aright
<lb/>I too must ask for thine, which I require
<lb/>That I may make thy wishes known to all.
<lb/>So now if thou wilt let me know thy name<ref target="n.199.1"/>
<lb/>I will return rejoicing to the camp.
<lb/>What thou hast spoken on this battlefield
<lb/>Will I detail in presence of the host,
<lb/>And in the presence of Manshur, the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>
<lb/>Of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, and <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> warriors and chiefs.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> said to him: <q>Seek not my name:
<lb/>Say what I seemed to thee. My heart is burning
<lb/>With love toward <persName>Piran</persName>, because the slaughter
<lb/>Of <persName>Siyawush</persName> hath pierced his liver too;
<lb/>He is the gentlest man in all <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>Speed him to me forthwith and we will see
<lb/>What time may bring.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Human</persName> replied: <q>O great one!
<lb/>Then thou art eager to behold <persName>Piran</persName>!
<lb/>What knowest thou of him or of Kulbiid,
<lb/>Pulad, or of Gurwi the son of Zira?</q>
<lb/><q>Why ask so many questions?</q> <persName>Rustam</persName> said.
<lb/><q>Try not to make a river run up-hill:

<lb/>Recalling what we each had done amiss,

<lb/>Then wilt thou see that I have told no lies;

<lb/>He will not budge without an interview ;

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q> Exalted one! I fear

<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> may come in all his pomp,
<lb/>But none will dream of seeing <persName>Rustam</persName>’s back ;

<lb/>He hath been long lord of <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>,

<lb/>And foster-sire erewhile to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>And warreth like a father in his anguish

<lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> said: <q>Go, say that which must be said

<lb/>Agree to give great gifts and then return ;
"Tis better not to court so great a fight ;

<lb/>Then we will battle likewise in full force,

<lb/>Put we our trust in God and war with <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>With all our strength ; his body is not brass

<head>How <persName>Piran</persName> came to <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> departed full of pain and fear,
<lb/>Heart-rent at <persName>Rustam</persName>’s doings. He approached
<pb n="202"/>
<lb/>The army of <placeName>Iran</placeName> and cried: <q>O chief,
<lb/>And lover of the fray! I heard that thou
<lb/>Hadst called for me of all this countless host
<lb/>Of <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>, and have come forth from my lines
<lb/>To thine to see what thou wouldst have of me.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When noble <persName>Rustam</persName> knew that from the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>
<lb/>A warrior approached he met <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>Before the host, an iron helm on head.
<lb/><q>What is thy name, O <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs>!</q> he demanded,
<lb/><q>What is thy will and purpose in this coming ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The other said: <q> Piradn am I, the chief

<lb/>The son of <persName>Wisa</persName>, for me in kind words,
<lb/>Which made my heart yearn toward thee, paladin !
<lb/>Declare to me which of the chiefs thou art.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered: <q>I am <persName>Rustam</persName> of <placeName>Zabul</placeName>,
<lb/>My sword is from <placeName>Kabul</placeName>, my clothing mail.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, on hearing noble <persName>Rustam</persName>’s words,
<lb/>Dismounted and did reverence. <persName>Rustam</persName> said :—
<lb/><q>I greet thee from the bright-souled Sun <persName>Khusrau</persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="972"/>
<lb/>O paladin! and from his mother too,
<lb/>The daughter of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, who dreameth
<lb/>Of thy love every night.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>I greet thee also, elephantine chief!
<lb/>In God’s name and the host’s. May He Who giveth
<lb/>All good things bless thee, may thy signet be
<lb/>A passport to the sky. Thanks be to God,
<lb/>My Refuge, that I see thee here. Are <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName>Sam</persName>, Zawara, Fardmarz,
<lb/>Those men of prudent hearts and prosperous—
<lb/>May this world never know the want of them—
<lb/>Are they in health, good spirits, and estate ?
<lb/>Now will I speak unless thou take it ill
<lb/>That subjects should complain of those in power.
<lb/>I planted in the Garden once a Tree,
<pb n="203"/>
<lb/>Whose leaves proved colocynth, whose fruit proved blood,
<lb/>And it hath caused me many grievous tears,
<lb/>For, though 'twas once my treasure and my life,
<lb/>It now hath brought me grief and yieldeth bane
<lb/>Instead of antidote, for <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>Esteemed me as his sire and shield from harm,
<lb/>While I gave him my daughter and a province,
<lb/>That he might illustrate my race; but some
<lb/>Have slain him and my daughter cruelly,
<lb/>And haply thou wilt say it served me right.
<lb/>Great are the care, the anguish, and the pains,
<lb/>That I have sutiered both from king and people,
<lb/>And God shall be my witness in the world,
<lb/>Although to call the Almighty as a witness
<lb/>Is wrong, and though so long a time hath passed,
<lb/>And I have heard much counsel from the wise,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="973"/>
<lb/>That mourning hath not ceased within my house,
<lb/>And that my soul is still aflame with grief,
<lb/>That I pour out my blood instead of tears,
<lb/>And constantly am in the leech’s hands.
<lb/>That act hath ruined me, heaven hath not turned
<lb/>As I could wish; I, since I learned the fate
<lb/>Of <persName>Siyawush</persName>, have done naught, good or ill,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="974"/>
<lb/>But been between two realms and two great kings
<lb/>In anguish, misery, and impotence.
<lb/>I risked my life for Farangis, whose father
<lb/>Had sought to slay her, but I kept her hidden
<lb/>In mine own house, providing for her there.
<lb/>She in return would have my life, would have
<lb/>Her foemen’s heads from me! All grief am I,
<lb/>O paladin! and both sides rail at me.
<lb/>I have no way to flee <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>I have no other resting-place or home;
<lb/>I am concerned for treasure, lands, and herds,
<lb/>And see not any pretext for departing ;
<pb n="204"/>
<lb/>I have my sons and many women-folk,
<lb/>Such are the cares and ties of every one.
<lb/>Whene'er <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> commandeth war
<lb/>He will not suffer me to close mine eyes ;
<lb/>Against my will I must lead forth the host,
<lb/>I may not disobey. The occasion now
<lb/>Is one for pity not for war with me.
<lb/>Had I no other pain and grief at heart
<lb/>About my kin save that Pilsam was slain. ...<ref target="n.204.1"/>
<lb/>But there are many other gallant youths,
<lb/>Who have not had their fill of combating,
<lb/>And seeing that I tremble for my life
<lb/>I speak about my sons and property.
<lb/>By God the Conqueror, O paladin !
<lb/>Be not incensed against me, harbour not
<lb/>A grudge against my kin, keep God in mind.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="975"/>
<lb/>Now by the illustrious soul of <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>I swear that death is better far for me
<lb/>Than breastplate, sword, and helm, for if our troops
<lb/>Engage thou wilt see mountains of the slain;
<lb/>Yet those from Shakn, Kashan, Saklab, and <placeName>Hind</placeName>—
<lb/>The lands between the <placeName>Indus</placeName> and this march—
<lb/>Are guiltless of the blood of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>Though brought as soldiers to this battlefield.

<lb/>From thee—the least injurious of <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>.
<lb/>Thou hast done righteously in all and sought

<lb/>That war and strife are evils, rocks and mountains
<note n="204.1">See Vol. ii. p. 350,</note>
<pb n="205"/>
<lb/>Know that, but when the king of kings is bent
<lb/>On vengeance we must pour the arrows in.
<lb/>On two conditions there may be peace yet;
<lb/>Consider if ye will consent to them:
<lb/>One is—that thou shalt send to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>In bonds all those that through the prince’s death
<lb/>Insensately have set this scene of strife,
<lb/>Although not authors of the war, and those,
<lb/>The guilty of the blood of that just head,
<lb/>Although they may be not upon the field.
<lb/>The other is—thou shalt prepare thyself,
<lb/>And come with me to our victorious <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.
<lb/>As to the goods which thou wilt leave behind,
<lb/>And dost esteem so precious, thou shalt have

<milestone unit="vullers" n="976"/>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> reflected: <q>To desert <placeName>Turan</placeName>,

<lb/>Again by thus demanding those in fault

<lb/>The imperious monarch brooked not mine advice,

<lb/>That some one holdeth <persName>Rustam</persName> in respect,
<lb/>I now extend my hand as succourer.
<lb/>No Elephant is he or Lion's match,
<lb/>Nor is his prowess as <persName>Piran</persName> asserteth.
<lb/>We must be firm herein, and not erase
<lb/>All thoughts of vengeance on him from our hearts.
<lb/>Draw we our maces at the dawn, advance
<lb/>Across the plain, make air like clouds in spring,
<lb/>And pour a rain of arrows on the foe;
<lb/>Then through the dust of horse and crash of axes
<lb/>None must know head from foot. Observe me well,
<lb/>And, when I raise the war-cry, charge amain.
<lb/>We are—we warriors and cavaliers—
<lb/>Good sooth! above a hundred thousand strong,
<lb/>And shall we, lifeless though not slain, thus vilely
<lb/>Shrink from one man? When I confront the Sigzian
<pb n="210"/>
<lb/>Send ye the dust-clouds skyward ; let none escape ;
<lb/>A coward’s heart is naught.</q></p>
<p><lb/>On hearing this,
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, old as he was, grew young of heart,
<lb/>And said: <q>Live happy, free from grief and care,</q>
<lb/>While all the nobles and the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Acclaimed the king of <placeName>Hind</placeName>.
<lb/>Now when <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>Came to his tent the chiefs resorted thither—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="981"/>
<lb/><persName>Human</persName>, <persName>Barman</persName>, and Nastihan, whose minds
<lb/>Were poised 'twixt hope and fear. Humdn inquired :—
<lb/><q>What is thy purpose? Doth it furnish ground
<lb/>For peace, or are the armies to engage?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> told what Shangul had said, and how
<lb/>The troops agreed to battle on, whereat
<lb/><persName>Human</persName> was sore displeasured and, incensed
<lb/>Against ill-starred Shangul, said to <persName>Piran</persName> :—
<lb/><q>None can escape the sky and what it bringeth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He met <persName>Kulbad</persName> and said: <q>Shangul is mad!
<lb/>If <persName>Rustam</persName> be what I have seen, and heard
<lb/>From chiefs, Shangul, Kundur, Manshur, will not
<lb/>Survive this battlefield, nor will the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>.
<lb/>Withdraw we for a while and reckon up
<lb/>Our chance of gain or loss. Thou wilt behold
<lb/>Of this unbounded host, whose massive maces
<lb/>Might quell the world, the more part laid to earth
<lb/>With blood-drenched helms and mail for winding-sheet.</q>
<lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName> replied: <q>O wielder of the sword !
<lb/>Keep if thou canst from evil presages,
<lb/>And sadden not the hearts.of thine own side;
<lb/>The matter may be other than we think.
<lb/>The better course for thee is not to fret
<lb/>Or worry over ills not come as yet.</q></p></div>

<p>
<lb/>On his side <persName>Rustam</persName> called his mighty men—

<lb/><persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Giv</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <persName>Ruhham</persName>, and <persName>Fariburz</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Kharrad</persName> the warrior and <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> the veteran, the cavalier,
<lb/>And that illustrious man of war <persName>Bizhan</persName>.
<lb/><q>Ye men of wisdom !</q> said the peerless chief,
<lb/>Addressing them at large in fitting words,
<lb/><q>Ye archimages wise and shrewd of heart!
<lb/>The man whom God doth render fortunate
<lb/>Is fit for crown and throne; he will possess
<lb/>The world, prevail in war, and will not fear
<lb/>The leopard, elephant, or crocodile.
<lb/>Our strength is all from God, and to what end
<lb/>Are we upon this darksome earth of ours ?
<lb/>To think no evil, but to choose the way
<lb/>Of God and wisdom, since the world is no man’s,
<lb/>And 'tis not well to take much joy therein ;
<lb/>Our worth is based on right and hardihood
<lb/>While knavery involveth harm and loss.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> was heart-seared when he came to me
<lb/>So hastily, he spake in many words
<lb/>Of his good offices to <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>Of his own travail and anxiety,
<lb/>And how through his entreaties Farangis
<lb/>Escaped the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s breath; and yet withal
<lb/>My heart foreboded that <persName>Piran</persName> would be
<lb/>Among the first to perish in this war,
<lb/>His son and brother die before his eyes
<lb/>With many of the noblest of his kin,
<lb/>And that <persName>Khusrau</persName> would slay <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>:
<lb/>Such was my dream. Know that they all will perish
<lb/>Beneath our feet, not one man will survive:
<pb n="212"/> 
<lb/>Howbeit I would not that this hand of mine
<lb/>Should slay their general; he hath no craft
<lb/>But honesty, and thinketh not of ill.
<lb/>If then he shall accomplish what he said,
<lb/>Be ancient wrongs forgotten ; if he yield
<lb/>The culprits and the goods, the strife is done,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="983"/>
<lb/>The war for me is over; in this world
<lb/>To deal uprightly is the best of all things.
<lb/>If from these chiefs with thrones and elephants—
<lb/>An army like the blue sea—he dispatch
<lb/>Both crowns and wealth, I shall not trouble further
<lb/>About the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>. They will all pay tribute
<lb/>Not being able to contend with us,
<lb/>And we will spare their lives because the All-giver
<lb/>Hath taught us wisdom and right ways. The world
<lb/>Is full of treasures, thrones, and crowns: a man
<lb/>Were fortunate indeed to win them all!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> in hearing this stood up and said
<lb/>To <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>O thou chieftain good and just,
<lb/>The host’s support, the adornment of the throne!
<lb/>The crown and throne and helm are bright through thee.
<lb/>Resplendent wisdom is thy capital
<lb/>And provand of thy soul. Peace is no doubt
<lb/>A better thing than war, but mark this well—
<lb/>The ox hath yet his hide. I will repeat
<lb/>To thee a saying of the olden times :—
<lb/><q>The souls of evil men shun righteousness
<lb/>E'er as the shoulders shun the burden’s stress,</q>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> now giveth pledges in his strait,
<lb/>But some day he will struggle to evade them.
<lb/>The Maker fashioned him a double-dealer,
<lb/>So hearken not to him and 'scape his guile.
<lb/>When first we set the battle in array
<lb/>We held a parley and forwent the fight
<lb/>Because an envoy came to say from him :—
<pb n="213"/>
<lb/><q>I am averse from strife and battlefield,
<lb/>And, recking not of country and of tents,
<lb/>Have girded up my loins to serve the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.</q>
<lb/>He heard from us much counsel and advice,
<lb/>And said: <q> Henceforth is war no mate of mine;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="984"/>
<lb/>I will depart and compass this affair
<lb/>Without delay, announcing to my kin
<lb/>My course herein, for J have throne and treasure
<lb/>And cattle, and for them I will provide.</q>
<lb/>I said: <q>Thy right course is to come at once ;
<lb/>Throne, wealth, and goods await thee in <placeName>Iran</placeName>;
<lb/>But keep the matter secret that thy fault
<lb/>May not be patent to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.</q>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, when we had spoken, went his way,
<lb/>And all that night companioned with the wind.
<lb/>He sent <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> a cameleer
<lb/>To say: <q>Array thy troops; a host hath come.</q>
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said that we had held no parle,
<lb/>Because it came to nothing, and <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>Upon the tenth day led his army forth
<lb/>Toward the plain and filled the world with troops.
<lb/>Just now he set, O leader of the host!
<lb/>Upon thy path another toy; just now,
<lb/>On seeing thy lasso’s coils, he feared for life.
<lb/>Their whole reliance was upon <persName>Kamus</persName>,
<lb/>And generals like Fartus and like Manshiur;
<lb/>But since he hath beheld <persName>Kamus</persName>' fortune
<lb/>Wrecked, and his slaughter in the lasso’s coils,
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> now knocketh at the door of peace,
<lb/>Not daring to remain upon the field,
<lb/>And, since he knoweth that his fall is nigh,
<lb/>Employeth colour, stratagem, and guile.
<lb/>As for the criminals, the wealth, and goods,
<lb/><q>Which I,</q> he said, <q> will gather and surrender,</q>
<lb/>Thou wilt perceive that when the tymbals sound,
<lb/>And <persName>Tus</persName> and <persName>Fariburz</persName> advance to war,
<pb n="214"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="985"/>
<lb/>He will in person lead the van and ever
<lb/>Renew the combat. All his words are lies,
<lb/>And <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> alone is his fit mate.
<lb/>If thou art deaf to me mark what befell
<lb/>My son <persName>Bahram</persName>! <persName>Piran</persName> thus held us back,
<lb/>And set an ambush such that, when the day
<lb/>Of battle came, he showed to us so great
<lb/>A graveyard of Gudarzians that I
<lb/>Must weep blood all my life, and have for leech
<lb/>An <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Said <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>Be thy words
<lb/>And wisdom wedded. He is as thou sayest.
<lb/>We and that old man differ, tis no secret ;
<lb/>But, in as much as he-hath done us good,
<lb/>I would not fight him to the bitter end.
<lb/>Remember how he acted toward the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And how he mourned the fate of <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>If he should break his word and set on us
<lb/>I have my lasso at my saddle-straps
<lb/>To take fierce Elephants. But I will fancy
<lb/>No ill at first ; we may escape a conflict ;
<lb/>But, if he should be faithless, he shall find
<lb/>The outcome pain and grief.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>Praised <persName>Rustam</persName>, saying: <q>Sol itself would fail
<lb/>To cozen thee, and in thy presence sleights,
<lb/>Deceptions, falsehoods, and <persName>Piran</persName>’s own words
<lb/>Take on no lustre. May the earth ne'er lack
<lb/>Our monarch’s head and crown, and mayst thou hold
<lb/>The chiefest place for ever.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> said :—
<q>'Tis dark and now our brains are dazed with talk;
<lb/>Quaff we till midnight, then safeguard our troops,
<lb/>And we shall see what God hath purposed for us.</q></p>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="986"/>
<p>
<lb/>He said moreover to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>:—
<lb/><q>To-night as we are drinking I will take

<lb/>Some happy omen and, when morrow cometh,
<lb/>Will shoulder <persName>Sam</persName> the cavalier's own mace,

<p>
<lb/>Whenas the sun displayed its shining crown
<lb/>The moon appeared as 'twere a silver shield,
<lb/>But terror-stricken at the rising din
<lb/>Declined and hid her face. The tymbals sounded
<lb/>Before the tent of <persName>Tus</persName>, the world grew ebon
<lb/>With chargers' dust ; it filled the air; the ground
<lb/>Turned indigo, and <persName>Rustam</persName> donned his mail.
<lb/>The army of <placeName>Iran</placeName> drew up in line,
<lb/>The sons intent on fight, the sires on vengeance.
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> son of Kishwiid was on the right
<lb/>In armour, brandishing a mace of steel,
<lb/>While <persName>Fariburz</persName> was stationed on the left,
<lb/>And washed the vengeance from his chieftains' hearts.<ref target="n.215.1"/>
<lb/><persName>Tus</persName> son of <rs type="role">Shah</rs> <persName>Naudar</persName> was in the centre,
<lb/>And all earth thronged with troops. Then peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Advanced to view the opposing chiefs; the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>,
<lb/>Whose elephants made earth like indigo,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="987"/>
<lb/>Was in the centre, on the right Kundur—
<lb/>A gallant horseman lion-like in battle—
<note n="215.1">i.e. by giving them so much that they wanted no more.</note>
<pb n="216"/>
<lb/>And on the left the veteran Gahar :
<lb/>The earth was wounded neath the horsemen’s hoofs.
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, upon his rounds before the host,
<lb/>Approached Shangul, the lover of the fray,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>O famous man of <placeName>Hind</placeName>!
<lb/>Folk from Shirwan to <placeName>Sind</placeName> perform thy bidding.
<lb/>Thou said’st to me: <q>To-morrow with the dawn
<lb/>Will I from all sides lead the host to fight ;
<lb/>Then will I challenge <persName>Rustam</persName> and bring down
<lb/>To dust that head which reacheth to the clouds.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered: <q>I abide by what I said,
<lb/>Thou shalt see from me neither more nor less,
<lb/>Now will I go before this vanquisher
<lb/>Of chiefs, and nail him through with arrow-points,
<lb/>Avenge Kamius and press the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With that he made three battles of his host,
<lb/>He beat the drums and dust rose from the plain.
<lb/>They marched, each battle, with huge elephants—
<lb/>An army-front extending o'er two miles.
<lb/>The heads of all the drivers were adorned
<lb/>With gaudy colours; each man wore a crown
<lb/>And earrings, with a gold torque round his neck,
<lb/>And belt of gold about his loins. The beasts
<lb/>Were draped with housings of brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Surmounted by a throne and seat of gold.
<lb/>Then there arose the blast of clarions,
<lb/>And all the elephants of war advanced ;
<lb/>Upon the right marched thirty thousand men—
<lb/>Illustrious cavaliers armed with the spear—
<lb/>Another thirty thousand on the left
<lb/>With bows and shields of <placeName>Chin</placeName>. The elephants
<lb/>Were in the centre with the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>, a throng
<lb/>That rolled earth’s surface as they marched along.

<lb/>Shangul went forth with <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword in hand
<lb/>Between the opposing lines; a parasol
<lb/>Of <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> make, compact of eagles' plumes,
<lb/>O'ershadowed him. Around him was an escort
<lb/>Which followed as he willed. On seeing this
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> rejoiced, feared not the fight with <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>And thus addressed <persName>Human</persName>: <q>To-day will fate
<lb/>Dispose the matter to our hearts' content
<lb/>With this equipment and such cavaliers,
<lb/>Each one so gallant, proud, and lion-like ;
<lb/>So go not thou thyself before the line,

<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> went thence toward the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host
<lb/>To where the elephantine hero stood ;
<lb/>Dismounted, did obeisance many times,
<lb/>And said: <q> High heaven taketh <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> from thee.
<lb/>Ne'er may thy days decline! Ne'er may thy face
<lb/>Show grief! When I returned, O paladin!
<lb/>I gave thy message both to old and young.
<lb/>I talked to them of all thine excellence,
<lb/>Though who on earth can praise thee worthily ?
<lb/>I spake moreover both of peace and war,
<lb/>Employing every sort of plea. <q>But how
<lb/>Can we do this,</q> they said at last, <q>and stay
<lb/>Revenge as thou advisest? We can give

<lb/>As much as he shall ask of gold and treasure,

<lb/>But as for giving up the guilty folk
<lb/>It may not be. Consider what it meaneth.
<lb/>Whom save the kinsmen of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Know’st thou as guilty? Be not rash in promise,
<lb/>For all the men that <persName>Rustam</persName> asketh of us
<lb/>Are chiefs—yreat men with thrones and diadems !
<lb/>How shall we or how can we give them up?
<lb/>Demands like these would make a young man gray.
<lb/>When such an army hath arrived from <placeName>Chin</placeName>,
<lb/>Saklab, Khatlin, and from our own <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>How should <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> desire a peace
<lb/>When he hath brought such hosts o'er sea and land ?</q>
<lb/>I got no lack of blame in their reply,
<lb/>And so I have returned to thee in haste.
<lb/>Now of these troops an army like the sea

<lb/>And know thee not but call thee <q>him of Sigz.</q><ref target="n.218.1"/>
<lb/>The king of <placeName>Hind</placeName> is fain to fight with thee
<lb/>With bow and arrow and with <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword,
<lb/>But sure am I that in the end this host
<lb/>Will weep because of elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> heard this he was very wroth,
<lb/>And said thus to <persName>Piran</persName>: <q>Thou luckless one!
<lb/>Why hast thou so much guile and subterfuge ?
<lb/>Why wilt thou walk upon a precipice ?
<lb/>The king of earth hath spoken much to me
<lb/>In public and in private of thy lies.

<lb/>Thou wast but one great lie from head to foot.
<lb/>Thou wallowest recklessly in thine own blood

<lb/>Upon a Mountain ; we may fight in mass,
<pb n="222"/>
<lb/>But let not any one attack the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>
<lb/>In single combat, for he cannot ’scape.</q>
<lb/><q>This morn thy views and words were other,</q> said
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs>, and bade the troops charge mountain-like
<lb/>In full force to hem <persName>Rustam</persName> in and end
<lb/>His life. That Lion drew his scimitar,
<lb/>And brake the left wing of the host of <placeName>Chin</placeName> ;
<lb/>Each stroke strewed trunkless heads upon the plain.
<lb/>No mountain could withstand him in the fight,
<lb/>Or elephant his fury. Warriors
<lb/>Beset him till they dimmed the sun above him,
<lb/>While from the many spears, swords, shafts, and maces,
<lb/>Employed against the lion-taking chief,
<lb/>One would have thought that he was in a reed-bed,
<lb/>And all the realm a winefat running blood.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="994"/>
<lb/>At every blow he sliced a hundred spears,
<lb/>And as an angry lion roared and raged.
<lb/>Behind him came the warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>With vengeful hearts and eager for the fray.
<lb/>As for the maces, mallets, spears, and swords,
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Hail falleth.</q> Corpses, hands,
<lb/>Heads, coronets, and helmets of the slain
<lb/>Filled all the field, high heaven seemed earth with dust,
<lb/>And many a neck and breast were cloven piecemeal.
<lb/>The troops all cried: <q> The plain is like a mountain
<lb/>With slain!</q> The hosts of men from <placeName>Chin</placeName> and Shakn,
<lb/>From <placeName>Hind</placeName>, Saklab, Hardt, and from Pahlav<ref target="n.222.1"/>
<lb/>Stretched o'er plain, height, and river, and they all
<lb/>Were smitten by one man!
<lb/>Then to <persName>Kulbad</persName>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> turned, saying: <q>This battlefield hath lost
<lb/>Its charms, for he is irresistible;
<note n="222.1">Cf. p. 109.</note>
<pb n="223"/>
<lb/>There is no leader like him in the world.
<lb/>No sage would credit that one cavalier
<lb/>O'erthrew three hundred thousand warriors.
<lb/>This feud hath brought ill on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;
<lb/>Where will he find repose and rest from <persName>Rustam</persName> ?
<lb/>Good sooth! we shall be blamed when he inquireth

<p><lb/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="995"/>
<lb/>Said <persName>Rustam</persName> to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>: <q>This fight
<lb/>Hath harmed us not. Now will I take from <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>These elephants, this wealth, these splendid crowns,
<lb/>And thrones, bestow them on <placeName>Iran</placeName> and make
<lb/>The day a happy and a glorious one.
<lb/>I want no helper from the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>God and the feet of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> are help enough.
<lb/>I will not leave a man from <placeName>Chin</placeName>, Saklab,
<lb/>And Shakn to set his foot upon the ground,
<lb/>For 'tis our day of victory; high heaven
<lb/>Iilumineth our star, but ill betideth
<lb/>The men of evil words and evil deeds.
<lb/>If God affordeth strength my glossy <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>Shall show his mettle, I will make this plain
<lb/>A graveyard, and the fertile land a salt-marsh.
<lb/>Resume ye now your posts, be diligent,
<lb/>And swift as wind. Attend. When I advance
<lb/>Sound gong and bell, and make the whole earth ebon
<lb/>With dust of cavaliers and tymbal-din.
<lb/>Ply ye your axes and your massive maces,
<lb/>Like blacksmiths' hammers on a mass of steel,
<lb/>And fear ye not the numbers of the foe,
<lb/>But make the very water reek to heaven.
<pb n="224"/>
<lb/>Cleave ye the ranks of <placeName>Chin</placeName> and of Saklab;
<lb/>Earth must not see the sky. Watch well my helm,
<lb/>And, when I raise the war-cry, charge amain.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thence like a raging elephant, and bearing
<lb/>His ox-head mace and shouting as he went,
<lb/>He sought the foemen’s right, and first encountered
<milestone unit="vullers" n="996"/>
<lb/>Kundur. He routed that wing utterly,
<lb/>And many a head and helmet disappeared.
<lb/>A kinsman of Kamius, one Sawa hight,
<lb/>Proud and o'erweening, came to counter <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>With <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> sword in hand. He wheeled about

<lb/>The hapless: nevermore shalt thou see battle.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When Sawa’s words reached <persName>Rustam</persName> he drew forth

<lb/>His foeman’s head and helm. Thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>That head hath never even seen its body!</q>
<lb/>He flung down Sawa, and rode over him
<lb/>Till every trace was lost. The enemy

<lb/>The warrior of Gahan, a lion-man

<pb n="225"/>
<lb/>On seeing <persName>Rustam</persName>’s helm, roared lion-like,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>I will avenge <placeName>Turan</placeName>

<lb/>He spurred forth to encounter mighty <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<p><lb/>Then he fled toward

<lb/>While like a tree upon a mountain-top
<lb/>Rose <persName>Rustam</persName>’s standard mid the host. He followed

<lb/>He speared and pierced the girdle of his foe,
<lb/>Rent both the corslet and its clasps, then flung him
<lb/>Down as the leafage falleth from a bough

<p><lb/>A thousand warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName> advanced

<lb/>The troops knew <persName>Rustam</persName>’s lion-appetite,

<lb/>That none could see the ground. What with the shouts

<lb/>Discerned 'twixt rein and stirrup; thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>The sun is veiled, earth tortured 'neath the horse- hoofs !</q>
<lb/>The air grew black, black as an Ethiop’s face ;
<lb/>They saw no way for slain; mails, helms, and saddles
<lb/>Filled all the field, and heads farewelled their bodies.
<lb/>The horsemen’s dust went down the wind, the earth

<p><lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> raged like a leopard and rushed forth

<lb/>And drivers. We will take them to <persName>Khusrau</persName>—
<lb/>A novel present from Shingan and <placeName>Chin</placeName>.</q>
<lb/>Then from his post he cried: <q> May <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>
<lb/>Wed Turkistan and <placeName>Chin</placeName>! Ho! luckless ones,
<lb/>Resourceless, wretched, fed on grief, and lost !
<lb/>Have ye ne'er heard of <persName>Rustam</persName>? Or hath wisdom
<lb/>Fled from your brains? He holdeth dragon-men
<lb/>Of no account, and chooseth elephants
<lb/>As opposites. Would ye still fight with me
<lb/>Whose only gifts are mace and scimitar?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He loosed his twisted lasso from its straps,
<lb/>Flung the raw coil upon his saddle-bow,
<lb/>And urged his charger on. A shout arose

<lb/>With lasso on his arm and frowning brow.
<lb/>Now every time that <persName>Rustam</persName> in the fight
<lb/>Unhorsed a chieftain with the coiling noose,
<lb/>The leader <persName>Tus</persName> sent cloudward from the field
<lb/>The sound of trump and drum, while an <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs>

<lb/>Toward the heights. Now when from elephant-back
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Khan</rs> saw earth rise like the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, and there,
<lb/>Astride a lofty Hill, an Elephant
<lb/>That grasped a lasso made of lion’s hide,
<lb/>And brought down vultures from the murky clouds,
<lb/>While stars and moon looked on, he chose a chief,
<lb/>Learned in the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> tongue, and said: <q> Approach
<lb/>Yon lion-man and say: <q> Fight not so fiercely.
<lb/>These troops of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, of Shakn, Chaghan, and Wahr

<lb/>And said: <q>O chieftain, lover of the fray !

<lb/>Withdraw as he withdraweth, for the strife

<lb/>Was slain, the heads of all our chiefs were turned.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> answered thus: <q>The elephants,
<lb/>The crown, and ivory throne must all be mine.
<lb/>Ye set your faces to lay waste <placeName>Iran</placeName>:
<lb/>What need is there for talk and blandishments ?
<lb/>He knoweth that his host is in my hands,
<lb/>And that I check the ardour of mine own.
<lb/>I spare his own head, but his elephants,
<lb/>Torque, crown, and throne of ivory are mine.</q>
<lb/>The messenger replied: <q> O lord of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> !
<lb/><q>Spare</q> not upon the waste the uncaught gazelle!
<lb/>The plain is all men, elephants, and troops.
<lb/>Who hath crown, wealth, and grandeur like the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> ?
<lb/>Who knoweth too the outcome of the day,

<lb/>Is this the day for jest, the time for counsel ?
<lb/>Whenas the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName> shall see my lasso,
<lb/>When that fierce Lion shall behold mine armlet,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1003"/>
<lb/>He flung the lasso coiled and took the heads
<pb n="230"/>
<lb/>Of cavaliers, neared that white elephant,
<lb/>And then the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, grown desperate,
<lb/>Smote with the goad the creature's head and, roaring
<lb/>Like thunder in the month of <rs type="month">Farwardin</rs>,
<lb/>Took and hurled forth at <persName>Rustam</persName> deft of hand
<lb/>A double-headed battle-dart in hope
<lb/>To worst him and to take his noble head ;
<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName>, scathless, flung his lasso high,
<lb/>Dragged from his elephant the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Noosed by the neck, and dashed him to the ground,
<lb/>Where others bound his hands and drove him on
<lb/>Toward the Shahd afoot without his crown,
<lb/>His litter, throne, or elephant, and there
<lb/>They made him over.to the guards of <persName>Tus</persName>;
<lb/>That chieftain sent the drum-roll to the sky.
<lb/>This tricky Hostelry is ever so:

<lb/>Said: <q> We have found no traces of <persName>Piran</persName>!
<lb/>Return we to the field and send our troops
<lb/>In quest of him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> the lion-man
<lb/>Advancing came upon a world of corpses,
<lb/>Of goods, and treasure; all the plain was strewn
<lb/>With wounded men flung down and bound; of others
<lb/>Still living they saw none. Tents and enclosures
<lb/>Filled all the earth, and tidings came to <persName>Rustam</persName> :—
<lb/><q>The foe hath fled the field.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Like lion wroth
<lb/>He raged about the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>' sloth and slackness,
<lb/>And said reviling them: <q>Hath no one wisdom
<lb/>Paired with his brain? How when two mountains thus
<lb/>Shut in our foes could they escape in mass
<lb/>From us? Did not I say: <q>Send forward scouts,
<lb/>And make each gorge and dale like plain and waste?</q><ref target="n.234.1"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1008"/>
<lb/>Ye thought of ease and rest, the foe of toil
<lb/>And march. Slack bodies bring forth care and travail,
<lb/>But he who chooseth labour fruiteth treasure.
<lb/>How can I say: <q>I am at ease to-day</q> ?
<lb/>I tremble for <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then leopard-like
<lb/>He raged at <persName>Tus</persName> and said: <q>Is this a bedroom ?
<lb/>Or battlefield? See to Human, <persName>Kulbad</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, Ruin, and to Pulad thyself
<lb/>Henceforth with thine own host upon this plain :
<lb/>We are not of one province, thou and I.
<lb/>If ye have strength fight on your own account,
<lb/>For how should ye have me, when I have gained
<lb/>The victory and its results are spoiled ?
<lb/>See from what company the scouts were drawn,

<lb/>And who is head man of the family,

<lb/>Set him upon an elephant and thus
<lb/>Dispatch him to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> for execution.
<lb/>The ivory thrones, the jewels, and dinars,
<lb/>Brocade, crowns, treasure, coronets, and all
<lb/>That they took from us, seach for and bring hither,
<lb/>For there were many kings upon this plain ;
<lb/>The most illustrious of the world were here
<lb/>From <placeName>Chin</placeName> and from Saklab, from <placeName>Hind</placeName> and Wahr,
<lb/>And all possessed of realms and treasuries.
<lb/>First let us choose a present for the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And then my portion of the spoils and thine.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Tus</persName> and his warriors went and gathered all
<lb/>The golden girdles and the amber crowns,
<lb/>The ivory thrones and the brocade of <placeName>Rum</placeName>,
<lb/>The arrows, the horse-armour, and the bows,
<lb/>The iron maces and the <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> swords,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1009"/>
<lb/>And raised a mountain 'twixt the other two:
<lb/>The troops stood round and gazed. Then had an archer,
<lb/>A cavalier, broad-chested, strong, and valiant,
<lb/>Shot a four-feathered arrow o'er the heap,
<lb/>The carry had not reached from end to end !°
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> saw the spoil he stood amazed,
<lb/>And oft invoking the Creator said :—
<lb/><q>Our changeful lifetime giveth feast and fight
<lb/>By turns, transferring wealth from host to host.
<lb/>It giveth now with curses, then with blessings ;
<lb/>One gathereth wealth for others to enjoy.
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName> was minded, and the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> as well,
<lb/>To burn <placeName>Iran</placeName>. With these huge elephants,
<lb/>These havings, troops, and stores, their joy was all
<lb/>In them and in their multitudes of men,
<pb n="236"/>
<lb/>And for a while God was not in their thoughts,
<lb/>God who created heaven and earth and time,
<lb/>Much manifest and much mysterious.
<lb/>Their host is not, their goodly wealth is not,
<lb/>Their aims and unjust doings are no more !
<lb/>Now will I send the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> these chosen chiefs
<lb/>From every realm on their huge elephants,
<lb/>Together with these golden thrones and crowns,
<lb/>And goods on lusty camels. I will send
<lb/>Such goods as are most worthy to be sent,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1010"/>
<lb/>And journey hence myself with all dispatch
<lb/>To Gang, for heroes cannot brook delay.
<lb/>To spare the guilty and the murderers
<lb/>Is weakness ; let us wash our hands in blood.
<lb/>I will allow the bad no rest but bring
<lb/>The heads of these idolaters to dust,
<lb/>And show to all the way of Holy God.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName> replied: <q>O thou of goodly rede!
<lb/>Mayst thou remain till place shall be no more.</q>
<lb/>Then matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> sought a messenger

<lb/>And chose out <persName>Fariburz</persName> son of <persName>Kaus</persName>,
<lb/>Commended by his kinship, and thus said :—
<lb/><q>Famed chief, of royal race, thyself a king,

<lb/>Take up a task. Go, bear to our young <rs type="role">Shah</rs>

<p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> summoned an experienced scribe,

<lb/>With ambergris for ink on painted silk ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1011"/>
<lb/><q>The letter opened with the praise of God,
<lb/>Who is and who will be for evermore,
<lb/>The Maker of the sun and moon and <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> ;
<lb/>Of <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and crown and might the Artist He;
<lb/>Heaven, earth, and time are His; the soul and wisdom
<lb/>Obey Him. May He bless the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, and may
<lb/>The age not have him in remembrance only.
<lb/>I came between two mountains as thou badest :
<lb/>The troops of three realms were assembled there.
<lb/>More than a hundred thousand in good sooth
<lb/>Opposed us, men who drew the scimitar—
<lb/>Troops from Kashan and Shakn, from <placeName>Chin</placeName> and <placeName>Hind</placeName>—
<lb/>A host which stretched from the <placeName>Indus</placeName> unto <placeName>Chin</placeName>—
<lb/>While from <placeName>Kashmir</placeName> to the outskirts of <persName>Mount</persName> Shahd
<lb/>We saw but litters, tents, and elephants.
<lb/>I feared not for the empire of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>But slew our foes; we fought for forty days ;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>The world is strait to them.</q>
<lb/>They all were kings with treasures, crowns, and thrones.
<lb/>Now 'twixt the mountains over dale and waste
<lb/>One cannot pass along for blood and slain,
<lb/>And in good sooth for forty leagues the soil
<lb/>Is turned to clay with blood. To tell the whole
<lb/>Were tedious. All the kings that I have bound,
<lb/>Plucked with my lasso from their elephants,
<lb/>Lo! I have sent the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, with gifts and jewels
<lb/>King-worthy, but war on myself; perchance

<pb n="238"/>
<lb/>May every tongue be filled with praise of thee,

<p><lb/>He gave the letter, when it had been sealed,
<lb/>In charge to <persName>Fariburz</persName>, that royal prince,
<lb/>With captive kings and elephants, and set
<lb/>The spoils upon three thousand camels' backs.
<lb/>So Farfburz son of <persName>Kaus</persName> went forth
<lb/>Rejoicing, and made speed to reach <persName>Khusrau</persName>.
<lb/>The elephantine hero, with the chiefs
<lb/>And warriors of the army, saw him off
<lb/>With fond embraces when they said farewell,
<lb/>While tears rained from the eyelids of the prince.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, when the dark night’s tresses showed,
<lb/>Departed on his way toward the host.
<lb/>They sat with harp and wine and minstrelsy,
<lb/>This reveller with harp and that with pipe,
<lb/>Until they went their ways in full content,
<lb/>Each to his rest.
<lb/>Hued like a gold dinar
<lb/>Sol burst the Veil of Lapis-lazuli,
<lb/>Whereat the clarion’s blast rose from the court
<lb/>Before the chief’s pavilion. Matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>All ready-girded, mounted his swift steed,
<lb/>And bade the soldiers take supplies with them.
<lb/>Their way was hard—the longsome desert route.
<lb/>They marched to war, and matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> said
<lb/>To <persName>Tus</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>: <q>Ye gallant chiefs! this time
<lb/>Will I fight strenuously and press the foe.
<lb/>Who knoweth if this crafty man of <placeName>Sind</placeName>
<lb/>Will bring a host from <placeName>Hind</placeName>, Saklab, and <placeName>Chin</placeName> ?
<lb/>But I will so bemuse and daze his wits,

<lb/>They marched two stages from the battlefield

<lb/>The chieftain saw a wood and called a halt,
<lb/>And, while his soldiers darkened plain and stream,
<lb/>Indulged in song and wine till some were filled
<lb/>With mirth and pleasure, and some lay bemused,

<head>How <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> made Answer to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s Letter</head>
<p>
<lb/>Heaven turned, some days elapsed, and then one went

<p><lb/><rs type="role">Shah</rs> and chiefs
<lb/>Went out to welcome him with trumpets, tymbals,
<lb/>And many troops. When <persName>Fariburz</persName> drew near,
<lb/>And caught sight of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, he kissed the ground,
<lb/>And offered many praises, saying thus :—
<lb/><q>O <rs type="role">Shah</rs> of goodly fortune! may high heaven
<lb/>Be glad of heart through thee and may the world
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1014"/>
<lb/>Thrive through thy justice,</q> then gave <persName>Rustam</persName>’s letter.
<lb/>The king of kings perused it, marvelling
<lb/>At what the chief reported of that fight,
<lb/>Inspected prisoners, camels, elephants,
<lb/>And wounded men, and, having ridden apart,
<lb/>Put off his royal cap, got off his steed,
<lb/>And, wallowing in the dust before his God,
<lb/>Exclaimed : <q>O holy Ruler of the world!
<lb/>The oppressor wrought on me oppressively,
<lb/>And made me fatherless—all grief and anguish ;
<note n="239.1"><q>la terre était couverte de morts </q> (Mohl),</note>
<pb n="240"/>
<lb/>But Thou didst free me from my pains and woes,
<lb/>And give me crown and realm. Both earth and time
<lb/>Became my slaves, the world my treasury ;
<lb/>I offer thanks to Thee, not to the host,
<lb/>But grant me one thing—spare me <persName>Rustam</persName>’s life.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This done, he passed before the elephants,
<lb/>And captives whom he sent to join the wretched
<lb/>In ward, then bade to bear with all dispatch
<lb/>The booty to the treasurer and make ready
<lb/>A pleasant dwelling for the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>He spent a day in writing his response,
<lb/>And set a new Tree in the garth of greatness.
<lb/>He first praised God, the Author of his triumph,
<lb/><q>The Master of the sun and turning sky,
<lb/>From Whom are war, alliances, and love,
<lb/>Who hath set up the heaven and graced the earth
<lb/>With night and day, Who giveth unto this
<lb/>So dark a fortune, and to that the throne
<lb/>That he deserveth. Grief and gladness come
<lb/>From Holy God—the Source of courage, awe,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1015"/>
<lb/>And reverence,</q> then said: <q>O paladin!
<lb/>Be ever pure in body, bright in soul.
<lb/>All that thou spakest of have reached the court—
<lb/>The prisoners, the elephants, the crowns,
<lb/>Brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, the thrones of ivory,
<lb/>Arabian steeds, and torques, and diadems,
<lb/>With camels in great plenty, tapestries,
<lb/>And wearing-stuffs, and showers of offerings,
<lb/>To grace our hocktides, feasts, and festivals.
<lb/>What man could wish to meet thee in the fight
<lb/>Unless he was already sick of life ?
<lb/>Now of thy toils among <rs type="ethnic">Turanian</rs> foes,
<lb/>By night and day upon the field, I had

<p><lb/>The gracious letter being done, and sealed
<lb/>By <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, he bade to be prepared
<lb/>A robe of honour, belts, horse-furniture,
<lb/>A hundred crisp-locked slaves with golden girdles,
<lb/>A hundred noble horses with gold trappings,
<lb/>A hundred camels laden with brocade
<lb/>Of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, a hundred more with tapestries,
<lb/>Two rings of shining rubies and a crown
<lb/>Of state compact of gold and lustrous pearls,
<lb/>A suit of royal raiment worked in gold,
<lb/>With armlet, torque, and golden belt, and presents—
<lb/>A treasure in themselves—for every chief.
<lb/>He sent to <persName>Fariburz</persName> a blue steel sword,

<lb/>And bade him goto <persName>Rustam</persName> and say thus :—

<lb/>And in such pleasures fleeted time a while.
<lb/>On marching one stage thence he saw a city
<lb/>By name Bidad <ref target="n.244.1"/>—a hold inhabited
<lb/>By folk whose only food was human flesh.
<lb/>The lovely there were ever perishing,
<lb/>While at the table of a king so loathly
<lb/>The flesh of growing youths alone was served.
<lb/>Those slaves that were the goodliest, and were
<lb/>Unblemished in their faces and their forms,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1020"/>
<lb/>Supplied the provand for the monarch’s board ;
<lb/>Such was his food. The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> called
<lb/>Three thousand cavaliers all clad in mail
<lb/>On barded steeds and sent them to that hold
<lb/>With <persName>Gustaham</persName> and two more valiant chiefs;
<lb/>Bfzhan the son of <persName>Giv</persName> was one, Hajir <ref target="n.244.2"/>
<lb/>The other—both redoutable in fight.
<lb/>The king’s name was Kafur; he held the city
<lb/>By patent. When he heard that from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>A host, led by a famed and warlike chief,
<lb/>Approached, he armed as did his pard-like people,
<lb/>Who were skilled lasso-flingers, cavaliers,
<lb/>And Stones and Anvils in the fray. Kafur
<lb/>Encountered <persName>Gustaham</persName> ; the armies closed ;
<lb/>'Twas such a fight as when a lion chargeth

<lb/>When <persName>Gustaham</persName> saw this, and that the world

<lb/>Now will I bring thy fighting to an end.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Kafur came rushing with a furious charge

<lb/>When <persName>Tur</persName> the son of Farudun had left
<pb n="246"/>
<lb/><placeName>Iran</placeName> he called men skilled in every way,
<lb/>And by their aid began to build these walls
<lb/>Of stones and timber, brick and reeds, thus built them
<lb/>By toil and sorcery, expending toil
<lb/>And draining treasury, and gallant men
<lb/>Have striven much to send up dust therefrom,
<lb/>But none hath mastered them or profited.
<lb/>Here are munitions and abundant food,
<lb/>With subterranean ways to bring in more.
<lb/>Though thou mayst toil for years thou wilt get naught
<lb/>But strife, for catapults reach not these walls,
<lb/>Fenced by <persName>Tur</persName>’s magic and the breath of priests.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName> when he heard grew full of thought,
<lb/>His battle-loving heart was like a thicket,
<lb/>Such fighting liked him not, he brought up troops
<lb/>From every side, here was <persName>Gudarz</persName>, there <persName>Tus</persName>
<lb/>With trumpets, drums, and elephants behind ;
<lb/>The army from <placeName>Zabul</placeName> was on the third side,
<lb/>Mail-clad and armed with falchions of <placeName>Kabul</placeName>.
<lb/>The veteran <persName>Rustam</persName> took his bow in hand,
<lb/>And all the fortress stood astound at him
<lb/>As he picked off the head of every one
<lb/>Who showed himself above the battlements :
<lb/>The shaft-points whispered secrets to those brains—
<lb/>An intercourse that made no harmony.
<lb/>In order to dislodge the garrison
<lb/>He undermined the walls, propped them with posts
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1023"/>Smeared with black naphtha and, when half way round,
<lb/>Set them on fire. He brought <persName>Tur</persName>’s ramparts down;
<lb/>The troops advanced on all sides. <persName>Rustam</persName> bade :—
<lb/><q>On to the assault; ply bow and poplar shaft.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The brave defenders threw away their lives
<lb/>With one accord to save their treasured wealth,
<lb/>Their children and their country and their kin:
<lb/>Far better for them had they ne'er been born!
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> warriors advanced on foot,
<pb n="247"/>
<lb/>And took their bows and arrows, and their shields,
<lb/>Advanced supported by the javelin-men,
<lb/>And led on by <persName>Bizhan</persName> and <persName>Gustaham</persName>.
<lb/>The raging of the fire and shower of shafts
<lb/>Left no resource but flight, and those that passed
<lb/>The castle-walls fled weeping o'er the plain.
<lb/>Then the besiegers barred the castle-gate
<lb/>And set themselves to pillaging and slaughter.
<lb/>What multitudes they slew! How many old
<lb/>And young they carried captive from the city!
<lb/>Much silver, gold, and other precious things,
<lb/>With beasts and slaves—both boys and girls—the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>Bore off with them, and marched back to the camp.
<lb/>The matchless Rustain, having bathed and prayed,
<lb/>Said to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> : <q>God must have in store
<lb/>Still better things than these; give praise to Him
<lb/>For victory and benefits vouchsafed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>With one consent the great men laid their faces
<lb/>Upon the ground and offered thanks to God,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1024"/>
<lb/>Then lauded <persName>Rustam</persName> : <q> Thine inferior,</q>
<lb/>They said, <q> might sit contented with his fame ;
<lb/>Thou with thine elephantine form, thy pluck,
<lb/>And lion’s claws hast never fight enough !</q></p>
<p><lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> said : <q> This strength and <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>
<lb/>Are gifts from God; ye also have your shares,
<lb/>And none can blame the Maker of the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade <persName>Giv</persName>, with ten thousand buckler-men,
<lb/>On barded steeds to haste and stay the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>
<lb/>From massing on the marches of <placeName>Khutan</placeName>.
<lb/>When night revealed its dusky curls, and when
<lb/>The moon’s back bent with trouble, <persName>Giv</persName> departed
<lb/>With those brave cavaliers and spent three days
<lb/>In raiding, then, what time the sun displayed
<lb/>Its crown and mounted on its ivory throne,
<lb/>Returned with many noble warriors captive,
<pb n="248"/>
<lb/>With many fair-cheeked Idols of <placeName>Taraz</placeName>,
<lb/>With noble horses, and all kinds of arms.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> sent a portion to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And gave the rest as booty to the host.
<lb/><persName>Gudarz</persName>,  <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Gustaham</persName>, <persName>Ruhham</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Shidush</persName> the valiant and <persName>Giv</persName>’s son <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>Thereafter rose and lauded him anew.
<lb/>Thus spake <persName>Gudarz</persName>: <q> Exalted one! thy love
<lb/>Is needful to the world. We may not open
<lb/>Our lips by night or day henceforward save
<lb/>To praise thee. Live glad and bright-souled for ever,
<lb/>Still old in wisdom and still young in fortune.
<lb/>God gave thee purity of race; like thee
<lb/>No one hath e'er been born of stainless mother.
<lb/>May sire succeed to sire and son to son,
<lb/>This native worth ne'er fail. Thou needest naught,
<lb/>Art favoured by the stars, and chief of nobles.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1025"/>
<lb/>Thy refuge be the Master of the world,
<lb/>Be earth and time thy partisans. Whoever
<lb/>Hath travelled o'er earth’s surface and beheld
<lb/>The world and peace and battle and revenge,
<lb/>Hath nowhere seen a better host than this,
<lb/>Nor ever heard from time-worn archimages
<lb/>Of such kings, elephants, and ivory thrones,
<lb/>Such men and steeds, such treasure and such crowns,
<lb/>And yet the stars saw it discomfited !
<lb/>We pondered but saw none to work our cure
<lb/>Till, as we cried out in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s breath,
<lb/>Thy bow delivered us. Crown of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>The Stay of chieftains, and pre-eminent,
<lb/>Art thou. We are thy lieges. God reward thee,
<lb/>And ever keep the smiles upon thy face.
<lb/>Repay we cannot, we can only praise.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> lauded them: <q> May earth,</q>
<lb/>Said he, <q>be peopled always with the brave.
<lb/>The nobles of <placeName>Iran</placeName> are my support—
<pb n="249"/>
<lb/>My bright heart witnesseth to what I say—
<lb/>My cheek is freshened by your goodly faces,
<lb/>My spirit is made radiant by your love.</q>
<lb/>He added: <q> We will tarry here three days,
<lb/>Rejoicing and illumining the world,
<lb/>But march to battle with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Upon the fourth and set the streams afire.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1026"/>
<lb/>In full assent arose the company,

<head>How <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had Tidings of the Coming of <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> had tidings: <q><persName>Rustam</persName> cometh
<lb/>To battle swiftly </q>—news that wrung his heart
<lb/>While all his silken raiment turned to thorns.
<lb/>He said: <q> Who can assay to combat <persName>Rustam</persName> ?
<lb/>Troops are enough, but where is a commander ?
<lb/>What man can go and challenge him to battle,
<lb/>For havoc clingeth to his glittering sword ?</q>
<lb/>The host said: <q>Shun not fight with him so much,
<lb/>For thou art one that in the dust of strife
<lb/>Canst send the wave of carnage to the moon.
<lb/>There is no stint of treasure, arms, and men;
<lb/>Why let the quest of battle grieve thy heart ?
<lb/>Be not concerned because thou hast to fight
<lb/>This cavalier; look at our gallant troops !
<lb/>Grant him alliron and brave; he is but one.
<lb/>Enough of him. Prepare the remedy
<lb/>With thine own army, and bring down his head
<lb/>From cloud to dust; that done, we need not fear
<lb/><rs type="role">Shah</rs> or <placeName>Iran</placeName>. Then <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, his throne,
<lb/>The country of <placeName>Iran</placeName> and bough on tree
<lb/>Will cease to flourish. <rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs> this noble host,
<lb/>These youths war-worthy. We for land and child,
<pb n="250"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1027"/>
<lb/>For wife and kindred, will give up our lives
<lb/>Before we yield our country to the foe.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now when Afrasiyib had heard those words
<lb/>He put that ancient battle from his thoughts,<ref target="n.250.1"/>
<lb/>Both for his fatherland and his own sake
<lb/>He took a fresh resolve and made reply :—
<lb/><q>I will bring forth the implements of war
<lb/>Since matters press, permit not <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>To rest upon his throne, glad and rejoicing
<lb/>In fortune, but by long contention bring
<lb/>The head of <persName>Rustam</persName> of <placeName>Zabul</placeName> to dust.
<lb/>I will not spare my grandson or his troops,
<lb/>But lay this quarrel with the scimitar.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He gave commandment to array the host,
<lb/>And march forth to new wars. The nobles blessed him,
<lb/>And called the chiefs to vengeance. There was one,
<lb/>A man of lion-heart by name Farghar,
<lb/>Quick to discern the cage and shun the springe.
<lb/>The king, who had observed and everywhere
<lb/>Approved his feat of arms, put strangers forth,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>O noble man! now seek
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host and spy on warlike <persName>Rustam</persName>.
<lb/>Observe his horsemmen’s numbers and equipment,
<lb/>And who of ours is acting as their guide.
<lb/><rs type="ethnic">Mark</rs> their war-elephants, their warriors,
<lb/>And all about their host both good and bad.</q>
<lb/>Farghar.departed to his work as spy
<lb/>Upon the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>, while the ambitious king,
<lb/>Absorbed in care, denied himself to strangers,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1028"/>

<lb/>And summoned his son Shida for consult.
<lb/><q>O thou,</q> he said, <q> who art endowed with wisdom !
<lb/>When will thy troops be here to share thy cares ?
<lb/>Know that yon countless army, which hath come
<lb/>With all those cavaliers to fight with us,
<note n="250.1">The battle in which he had encountered <persName>Rustam</persName>. See p. 243. Mohl translates <q> oublia les anciennes guerres.</q></note>
<pb n="251"/>
<lb/>Is led by <persName>Rustam</persName> of the lion-heart,
<lb/>Whose scimitar converteth dust to clay.
<lb/><persName>Kamus</persName>, Manshur, the <rs type="role">Khan</rs> of <placeName>Chin</placeName>, Gahar,
<lb/>The glorious Fartis, Kundur, Shangul—
<lb/>The king of <placeName>Hind</placeName>—an armament that stretched
<lb/>Down to the river <placeName>Indus</placeName> from <placeName>Kashmir</placeName>—
<lb/>Are slain or captive through the victory
<lb/>Of lion-taking <persName>Rustam</persName>. Forty days,
<lb/>With lulls at whiles, they fought but <persName>Rustam</persName> triumphed,
<lb/>Dragged with his lasso from their elephants
<lb/>Our warriors and bound them. Cavaliers
<lb/>And nobles from all climes, the mighty leaders,
<lb/>The arms and ivory throne, steeds, crowns, and camels
<lb/>Dispatched he to <placeName>Iran</placeName>, and by that token
<lb/>Is now invading us with his proud chiefs
<lb/>And famous men. I shall not leave my throne,
<lb/>Or much wealth here with fortune so inconstant,
<lb/>But send my treasures, crowns, belts, golden torques,
<lb/>And bucklers to the banks of the Almas :
<lb/>This is no time for joyance, harp, and song.
<lb/>I dread deft-handed <persName>Rustam</persName>, who is safe
<lb/>E'er in the gullet of a crocodile ;
<lb/>He is not human on the day of battle,
<lb/>He writheth not when hit nor crieth out
<lb/>For pain, he feareth not spear, sword, and arrow,
<lb/>Or maces raining from this ancient sky !
<lb/><q>He is of brass and iron,</q> thou wouldst say,
<lb/><q>And not of man’s race but an <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>!</q>
<lb/>So mighty are his arms on days of fight
<lb/>That earth’s back wearieth with the weight thereof!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1029"/>
<lb/>He weareth chain-mail, breast-plate, tiger-skin,
<lb/>And helm; he roareth like a thunder-cloud !
<lb/>Huge elephants sustain not his attack, :
<lb/>Or ships upon the azure sea<ref target="n.251.1"/> his weapons!
<lb/>The Mountain under him is swift as wind,
<note n="251.1"><q> Sur les flots de l'<placeName>Indus</placeName></q> (Mohl).</note>
<pb n="252"/>
<lb/>And, thou wouldst say, <q>begotten by the sky.</q>
<lb/>Swift as gazelle and terrible as lion
<lb/>It goeth gallantly at height and river,
<lb/>And would, I dare affirm, fare like a ship
<lb/>If put upon its mettle. Oft have I
<lb/>Contended with its rider, but his breast-plate
<lb/>Is made of leopard-skin, which foiled my weapon
<lb/>Though I tried ax and arrow many a time;
<lb/>But now by way of proof I will to war
<lb/>Once more to see if fortune favoureth us,
<lb/>And so if God affordeth us His aid,
<lb/>And if high heaven revolveth as we would,
<lb/>We will not leave <placeName>Iran</placeName> or <rs type="role">Shah</rs>: perchance
<lb/>It may be mine to terminate this feud,
<lb/>While should the might of <persName>Rustam</persName>’s hand prevail
<lb/>I will betake me o'er the sea of <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Betimes and leave these marches of <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>To him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then Shida answered : <q> Prudent king!
<lb/>Live happily while crown and throne endure.
<lb/>Thou hast <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>, wisdom, lofty mien, high birth,
<lb/>And fortune, heart, and manhood, thou dost need
<lb/>No imonitor, yet heed this turn of fate :
<lb/>Men like <persName>Piran</persName>, <persName>Human</persName>, and Farshidward,
<lb/><persName>Kulbad</persName> and Nastihan have had their armour
<lb/>Destroyed, and their hearts shattered, in the fight :
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q>Their grief hath broken them.</q>
<lb/>Launch not thy vessel while these war-winds blow,
<lb/>Since thou art ware that this great host hath come.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1030"/>
<lb/>Thou art the warrior-king experienced
<lb/>And tried in war; now by thy life and head,
<lb/>By sun and moon, by throne and cap, I swear
<lb/>This matter of <persName>Kamus</persName> and of the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>
<lb/>Hath filled my heart with pain, my head with venge- ance.
<pb n="253"/>
<lb/>Our business is to lead the host to Gang,
<lb/>Not contemplating battle but to call
<lb/>An army up from <placeName>Chin</placeName> and from Machin,
<lb/>And after that o'erthrow the enemy.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When he had spoken he withdrew to rest,
<lb/>Haste in his head and vengeance in his heart.
<lb/>The dark night oped its melancholy eyes,
<lb/>The moon had grown round-shouldered with distress,
<lb/>And all the world resembled sable musk
<lb/>What time Farghir came from the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host.
<lb/>He reached the presence of Afrisiyab
<lb/>By night—the time for quiet and repose—
<lb/>And thus reported : <q> From this lofty court
<lb/>I went to <persName>Rustam</persName>, binder of the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>.
<lb/>I saw a camp-enclosure green and vast
<lb/>With cavaliers resembling ravening wolves.
<lb/>A standard stood erect charged with a dragon ;
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said : <q>It is alive!</q> There stood
<lb/>Within the tent a huge, fierce Elephant,
<lb/>Whose girded waist was like a tiger’s loins.
<lb/>Before him was a steed, a piebald bay ;
<lb/>Thou wouldest say: <q>It never taketh rest.</q>
<lb/>The bridle hung down from the saddle-bow,
<lb/>A coiled hide-lasso from the saddle-straps.
<lb/>The chiefs were such as  <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>And <persName>Fariburz</persName>, <persName>Gurgin</persName>, and brave <persName>Shidush</persName>.
<lb/>Guriza is the scout with <persName>Gustaham</persName>
<lb/>Accompanied by <persName>Giv</persName> and by <persName>Bizhan</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The king grieved at the tidings of Farghar.
<lb/>Then came one to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> to say :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1031"/>
<lb/><q><persName>Piran</persName> the chieftain hath arrived like dust
<lb/>With great men and with warriors of the fight.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The king told what Farghar had said and asked :—
<lb/><q>Who is a match for <persName>Rustam</persName> in the fray?</q>
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> said: <q> What resource have we in war
<lb/>Except the quest of glory on the field?
<pb n="254"/>
<lb/>So let us struggle for our fatherland,
<lb/>Our children, and our kin.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Thereat grew instant to engage and bade
<lb/><persName>Piran</persName> march forth 'gainst battle-loving <persName>Rustam</persName>.
<lb/>They left the presence and went forth to war
<lb/>Upon the plain, shouts rose, the tymbals sounded,
<lb/>The troops' dust turned the world to ebony.
<lb/>So mighty was the host that thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>The whole world will be hidden by the dust!</q>
<lb/>The tymbal-players sent their din on high
<lb/>As elephant on elephant filed by.</p></div>

<lb/>He gave all needful orders to <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>And then withdrawing cleared his tent of strangers.
<lb/>They set ascribe before him. <q>Write,</q> said he,
<lb/><q>A letter unto <persName>Puladwand</persName> and make

<lb/>Who stablisheth and overthroweth us—
<lb/>The Lord of <rs type="heavenlybody">Saturn</rs> and the turning sky,

<lb/>What we have suffered from this famous fighter,
<lb/>And these renowned and all-accomplished chiefs,
<lb/>From <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and other warriors.

<lb/>The master of <placeName>Iran</placeName>, the mighty <rs type="role">Shah</rs>—
<lb/>Whom erst I cherished like dear life itself
<lb/>That no ill blast might reach him. Then proceed :—
<lb/><q>Now, if high heaven taketh side with us,

<lb/>Let Piladwand come hither. Many troops
<lb/>Brought from the marches of Saklab and <placeName>Chin</placeName>
<lb/>Have been o'erthrown and writhe, much field and fell
<lb/>Been harried by the warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>Their host is like a moving hill, their chiefs

<lb/>They raise the din of tymbals to the clouds.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName>, who alone hath vexed our land,
<lb/>Shall have been slain by thee no host will come
<lb/>Against it. Be thou our deliverer.
<lb/>If by thy hand his term shall reach its end
<lb/>The face of earth will surely be at rest.
<lb/>Then from my populous kingdom will I take
<lb/>But one half of my treasures as my share ;
<lb/>The other half, and half my crown, are thine,

<p><lb/>They sealed the letter with the royal seal,
<lb/>And Shida, as the moon arose in Cancer,
<lb/>Girt up himself in presence of his father
<lb/>To go grief-laden on the embassage.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1033"/>
<lb/>He came to <persName>Puladwand</persName> as swift as fire
<lb/>Through apprehension of calamity,
<lb/>Saluted him, delivering the letter
<lb/>And telling <persName>Rustam</persName>’s deeds. Now Puiladwand,
<lb/>A king whose aspirations reached high heaven,
<lb/>Lived in the mountain-parts of <placeName>Chin</placeName> and had
<lb/>No peer in all the land. He lacked not troops
<lb/>And men of war; he was a Crocodile;
<lb/>His troops were pards. He called his governors
<lb/>And priests, and held discourse with them at large,
<lb/>Told what the letter said and, being a prince
<lb/>Both youthful and imperious, commanded
<lb/>To bear the drums and camp-enclosure forth
<lb/>Upon the plain. He gathered troops and divs.
<lb/>The battle-ery went up. He led the way,
<pb n="256"/>
<lb/>Equipped with shield, with quiver, and with lasso,
<lb/>And followed by his standard. He descended
<lb/>The mountains, crossed the water, and drew near
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, at whose gate tymbals sounded,
<lb/>And all went forth to welcome Piladwand.
<lb/>The veteran monarch first embraced the chief,
<lb/>Then spake much of the past, told whence arose
<lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' trouble and the remedy.
<lb/>While going to the palace they considered
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1034"/>
<lb/>New stratagems. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> discussed
<lb/>The waiting and the forward policies,
<lb/>Told of the strife and outcry that had come
<lb/>Upon him through the death of <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>Told of the <rs type="role">Khan</rs>, Manshur, and brave <persName>Kamus</persName>,
<lb/>Recalling what had passed, and said: <q> My pain
<lb/>Is all through one who weareth leopard-skin.
<lb/>Mine arms are impotent on him and on
<lb/>That hide, that helmet, and that shield of <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>Plains hast thou trodden and a longsome road :
<lb/>Now fashion us a remedy for this.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The mind of Piladwand grew full of thought
<lb/>How this knot should be loosed. He made reply :—
<lb/><q>We must not hurry in so great a war.
<lb/>This is the self-same <persName>Rustam</persName> that laid waste
<lb/>And took <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> with his huge mace,
<lb/>Who rent the White Dfv’s side, the liverstead
<lb/>Of Bid, and of Pulad son of Ghundi.
<lb/>I have not prowess to contend with him,
<lb/>Or power enough to frustrate his attack ;
<lb/>Still let my body and my soul await
<lb/>Thy will, may wisdom ever be thy guide.
<lb/>Do thou incite the host against his host,
<lb/>Our numbers may bewilder him, and I

<lb/>To fight, and mailed, armed with an ox-head mace,
<lb/>Strove like a savage lion with the div,
<note n="257.1"><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,</note>
<pb n="258"/>
<lb/>Who flung his lasso round his foeman’s head.
<lb/><persName>Ruhham</persName> was with <persName>Bizhan</persName>; they both observed
<lb/>The mace, the prowess, and dexterity
<lb/>Of <persName>Puladwand</persName>, and went to bind his hands
<lb/>With lassos, but that wary warrior
<lb/>Urged on his steed and raised his battle-cry.
<lb/>Those two brave warriors of noble birth,
<lb/>Those haughty Lions casting such long shadows,
<lb/>He flung to earth, and trampled on in scorn,
<lb/>In sight of all the horsemen on the plain,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1036"/>
<lb/>And reaching <persName>Kawa</persName>’s standard clave the staff
<lb/>Asunder with his sword. The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> wailed,
<lb/>No warrior stood his ground upon the field.
<lb/>When <persName>Fariburz</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName>, and the other chiefs
<lb/>Beheld the traces of that warrior-div
<lb/>They said to <persName>Rustam</persName>, that avenging one :—
<lb/><q>There is not left upon this battlefield
<lb/>A single man of name still in the saddle,
<lb/>Or horseman of the warriors of this host,
<lb/>Whom <persName>Puladwand</persName> hath brought not to the ground
<lb/>With arrow or with lasso, mace or sword !
<lb/>The field of battle is a field of woe,
<lb/>And 'tis for <persName>Rustam</persName> to deliver us.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Anon arose a cry of pain and grief
<lb/>From both the wings and centre; then <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>The man of eld, supposing that <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>The lion-taking chieftain, and <persName>Ruhham</persName>,
<lb/>His offspring both, had perished in the fight,
<lb/>Cried in his anguish to the righteous Judge :—
<lb/><q>I had so many sons and grandsons once
<lb/>That I extolled my head above the sun,
<lb/>But they are slain before me in the wars,
<lb/>So greatly have my day and fortune changed !
<lb/>Slain in their youth while I live on hoar-headed !</q></p>
<p><lb/>He doffed his casque, he laid his girdle by,
<lb/>And then began to wail right bitterly.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> fought with Paladawand</head>
<p>
<lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName> when he heard was sorely grieved,
<lb/>He shook as 'twere a bough upon a tree,
<lb/>And drawing near to <persName>Puladwand</persName>, and seeing
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1037"/>
<lb/>His mountain-height grieved for those gallant four
<lb/>Like onagers contending with a lion,
<lb/>Saw one host sorely stricken and the other
<lb/>Unbroken, and he thought: <q> Our day hath darkened,
<lb/>Our nobles' heads are dazed! Good sooth! the strife
<lb/>Hath turned against us and our fortune sleepeth !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then gripping with his legs he urged on <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>And raging challenged <persName>Puladwand</persName> to fight,
<lb/>Exclaiming: <q>O thou ill-conditioned div!
<lb/>Thou shalt behold a change of fortune now.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The voice of <persName>Rustam</persName> reached those warriors,
<lb/>And he, perceiving them dismounted, said :—
<lb/><q>O Thou Almighty Ruler of the world!
<lb/>Thou art above the unseen and the seen.
<lb/>Far rather would I lose mine eyes in battle
<lb/>Than look upon this miserable day, _
<lb/>Whereon such cries have risen from <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>Such from <persName>Human</persName>, <persName>Piran</persName>, and yon fierce div!
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> and <persName>Ruhham</persName> and <persName>Tus</persName> are all unhorsed,
<lb/>And e'er <persName>Bizhan</persName> who used to mock at lions!
<lb/>The chargers of the great are pierced with arrows,
<lb/>The riders fight afoot as best they may.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then closing with the div he threw his lasso,
<lb/>But <persName>Puladwand</persName>, brave horseman though he was,
<lb/>Ducked in alarm, he had had fight enough ;
<lb/>But when the cast had failed and he was safe
<lb/>He said to <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>O thou gallant one,
<lb/>Thou veteran Lion and illustrious,
<lb/>Who scarest mighty elephants! ere long
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1038"/>
<pb n="260"/>
<lb/>Thou shalt behold the billows of the deep.
<lb/>Consider now the fire of mine attack,
<lb/>My lasso, courage, might, and enterprise.
<lb/>Thou shalt behold no traces of thy <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>His nobles, or his mighty men henceforth,
<lb/>Or of thy land, unless in dream, for I
<lb/>Will give thine army to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.</q>
<lb/><q>How much more shirking, blustering, and guile?</q>
<lb/>Said <persName>Rustam</persName>. <q>Let no warrior play the shrew
<lb/>Or he will give his head up to the winds
<lb/>Assuredly. Though thou be brave and proud
<lb/>Thou art not <persName>Sam</persName> nor yet stiff-necked <persName>Garshasp</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Puladwand</persName> recalled a saw of old :—
<lb/><q>They who unjustly seek to cause a fight
<lb/>Return with livers pierced and faces white ;
<lb/>If friend or foe harm thee 'tis well thou still
<lb/>Do thy devoir alike to good and ill.</q>
<lb/>He thought: <q>This is that <persName>Rustam</persName> who o'ercame
<lb/>By night with his huge mace <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName>,</q>
<lb/>And then he said: <q>O man approved in war!
<lb/>Why stand we here so long to no result ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Two mighty Elephants, two warlike Lions,
<lb/>Were they; they wheeled, the dust rose from the waste,
<lb/>And elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> with his mace
<lb/>Struck his foe’s head: all present heard the crash.
<lb/>Such darkness filled the eyes of <persName>Puladwand</persName>
<lb/>That he relaxed his hold upon his bridle,
<lb/>And, swerving to the right hand in his pain,
<lb/>Exclaimed : <q> An ill day this!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>—
<lb/>Looked for the brains of <persName>Puladwand</persName> to pour
<lb/>From both his ears but, since he kept his seat,
<lb/>Invoked the Maker of the world and said :—
<lb/><q>O Thou exalted over fortune’s wheel,
<lb/>The Lord, the All-seeing, and the Nourisher !
<lb/>If I am fighting in an unjust cause
<pb n="261"/>
<lb/>My spirit doteth not upon this world ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1039"/>

<lb/>But if the wrong is with <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Deprive me not of strength and skill in arms.
<lb/>It is not meet that thou shouldst loose my soul
<lb/>From bondage by the hand of <persName>Puladwand</persName>,
<lb/>For if I am to perish by his prowess
<lb/>No warrior will remain throughout <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>No husbanaman and no artificer,
<lb/>No dust, no country, and no field or fell.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He said to <persName>Puladwand</persName>: <q> What harm hast thou
<lb/>Got from the whirling mace? Thy hands relax
<lb/>Thy sable reins. Down, div! and beg thy life.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He said: <q>Thy mace hath harmed me not.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They closed,
<lb/>And <persName>Puladwand</persName> employed his sword of steel
<lb/>With many a feint and many an artifice,
<lb/>But failed to pierce through <persName>Rustam</persName>’s tiger-skin,
<lb/>Which filled the liver of the div with blood.
<lb/>That fierce one raged at fate because his sword
<lb/>Availed not on his foeman; he was troubled
<lb/>At <persName>Rustam</persName>’s neck and shoulders, and again
<lb/>Spake to him: <q> Doff this tiger's legacy,
<lb/>This armour, with that sable helm of thine,
<lb/>And put on others. I will do the like,
<lb/>And come with speed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q> Not so.
<lb/>That is no channel for a warrior’s stream.
<lb/>I will not change my gear, do thou keep thine.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then both the warriors wheeled till <persName>Puladwand</persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1040"/>

<lb/>Whose massive mace fell but without effect
<lb/>On <persName>Rustam</persName>’s tiger-skin and coat of steel,
<lb/>Said : <q> Wrestling is the test 'twixt man and man.
<lb/>Take we each other by the leathern belt,
<lb/>That we may know which one the will of fate
<lb/>Dismisseth worsted from the battlefield.</q>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q> O ill-conditioned div !
<pb n="262"/>
<lb/>Thou canst not stand a warrior’s blow, but like
<lb/>A fox employest craft. What profit is it
<lb/>To have thy head ensnared? Hast wile or spell
<lb/>In wrestling that will free that neck of thine
<lb/>From mine encircling arms?</q></p>
<p><lb/>They made a pact
<lb/>That none should interfere from either side,
<lb/>Then, lighting from their chargers, both the foes
<lb/>Took time wherein to breathe them and repose.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><head>The Wrestling of <persName>Rustam</persName> and Piladwand</head>
<p><lb/>These two exalted warriors bent on fight
<lb/>Prepared themselves to wrestle, and agreed :—
<lb/><q>No one on either side shall intervene.</q>
<lb/>The space between the hosts was half a league.
<lb/>The stars surveyed that fight as Pulidwand
<lb/>And matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>—those grim Lions—closed,
<lb/>Who felt each other, then each warrior
<lb/>Seized his opponent by the leathern belt.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1041"/>
<lb/>When Shida looked on <persName>Rustam</persName>’s chest and neck
<lb/>He drew a deep, cold sigh and thus bespake
<lb/>His sire <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>: <q> This mighty man,
<lb/>Whom thou call’st <persName>Rustam</persName>, binder of the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>,
<lb/>Will by his strength and prowess lay the head
<lb/>Of our brave warrior-div upon the dust,
<lb/>And thou wilt see our soldiers take to flight,
<lb/>So strive not vainly with the turning sky.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The sire replied : <q> My brain is fraught with care
<lb/>On that account, go and observe the prowess
<lb/>Of <persName>Puladwand</persName> in wrestling. Speak to him
<lb/>In <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> and advise him. He may get
<lb/>The elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName> off his feet.
<lb/>Tell Piladwand : <q>When thou hast got him down
<lb/>Let thine appeal be to the scimitar.</q></q></p>
<pb n="263"/>
<p><lb/>But Shida said: <q> This is not what the king
<lb/>Agreed to in the presence of the host.
<lb/>If thou art rash and breakest covenant
<lb/>Thy warfare will not issue in success.
<lb/>Befoul not this clear stream, else he that loveth
<lb/>Fault-finding will discover cause for blame.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> began to chide, becoming
<lb/>In his fierce wrath distrustful of his son,
<lb/>And said to him: <q>If <persName>Puladwand</persName> the div
<lb/>Shall be o'erthrown by this antagonist
<lb/>None will remain alive upon the field ;
<lb/>Thou hast a valiant tongue, no prowess else.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He plied his reins and came forth lion-like
<lb/>Upon the ground, observed the strife and shouts
<lb/>Like thunder, then he said to <persName>Puladwand</persName> :—
<lb/><q>If thou, exalted Lion! gett’st him down
<lb/>In wrestling rip him open with thy dagger ;
<lb/>We need not boasting but accomplishment.</q>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> marked the king’s wild words and eagerness,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1042"/>
<lb/>Then urging on his charger came in haste,
<lb/>Because the enemy had broken troth,
<lb/>And said to <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>O thou warrior!
<lb/>What orders givest thou thy servants? Speak!
<lb/>Observe <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, his eagerness, ,
<lb/>And wild words! He hath come forth to inflame
<lb/>The heart of thine antagonist and prompt him
<lb/>To use his dagger in a wrestling-bout !</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> said: <q> A man of war am I,
<lb/>And, when engaged in wrestling, bide my time.
<lb/>What do ye fear? Why are your hearts thus rent ?
<lb/>E'er now will I bring down from heaven above
<lb/>The head and neck of <persName>Puladwand</persName> to dust;
<lb/>But if I have not strength of hand therefor
<lb/>What need thus wantonly to break my heart ?
<lb/>Although this witless warlock doth transgress
<pb n="264"/>
<lb/>The covenant of God, why should ye fear
<lb/>The breach? He poureth dust on his own head.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then, like a lion, reaching out he clutched
<lb/>The chest and neck of that fierce Crocodile,
<lb/>And, straining hard, uprooted <persName>Puladwand</persName>,
<lb/>As though he were a plane-tree, from his place,
<lb/>Raised him aloft, dashed him upon the ground,
<lb/>And uttered praises to Almighty God.
<lb/>A shout rose from the army of <placeName>Iran</placeName>;
<lb/>The drummers marched out with the kettle- drums ;
<lb/>The blast of clarion, the clang of gong
<lb/>And <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bell ascended to the clouds,
<lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName> thus imagined: <q> <persName>Puladwand</persName>
<lb/>Hath not a sound joint in his body left,
<lb/>His bones are broken and his cheeks become
<lb/>The colour of the bloom of fenugreek,</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1043"/>
<lb/>So flung his leg across the gallant <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>And left the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s body as it lay ;
<lb/>But, when the lion-clutching hero reached
<lb/>His army, <persName>Puladwand</persName> glanced arrow-like,
<lb/>And fled with all speed to <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>With full heart and with tears upon his face.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> saw that <persName>Puladwand</persName> still lived,
<lb/>And troops were everywhere upon the plain,
<lb/>His heart grew straitened, he led on the host,
<lb/>Called unto him the veteran <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>And ordered: <q> Let them send a shower of arrows,
<lb/>And make the air as 'twere a cloud in spring.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> was on one wing, <persName>Giv</persName> on the other
<lb/>With veteran Rubham and brave <persName>Gurgin</persName>.
<lb/>Thou wouldst have said: <q> They have enkindled fire,
<lb/>And with their falchions set the world ablaze!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Puladwand</persName> said to his troops: <q> With throne,

<lb/>Our lives or think at all of further strife?</q>
<pb n="265"/>
<lb/>And, with his very life-cord snapped in twain

<lb/><q>The surface of the world is like a sea!
<lb/>Did not I say: <q>We cannot tarry here
<lb/>Secure from <persName>Rustam</persName> of the deadly hand ?</q>
<lb/>By murdering the youth beloved by him

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1044"/>
<lb/>How wilt thou fare? None of thine own remaineth,
<lb/>And <persName>Puladwand</persName> the div hath marched away.
<lb/>The horsemen of <placeName>Iran</placeName> on barded chargers
<lb/>Exceed in sooth a hundred thousand men ;
<lb/>The lion-catching <persName>Rustam</persName> is their leader,
<lb/>And air is full of arrows, earth of blood.
<lb/>From sea and plain, from mountain and from waste,
<lb/>Our warriors assembled ; when men failed
<lb/>We tried the divs. Great were the strife and shouts,
<lb/>But now, since <persName>Rustam</persName> came, no place is left
<lb/>For thee ; the only prudent course is flight.
<lb/>Since thou art here the treasure of the earth
<lb/>Thou shouldst withdraw to further <placeName>Chin</placeName>. Leave here
<lb/>Thy troops thus ranged for battle and betake thee,
<lb/>Thou and thy kindred, seaward.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The king saw
<lb/>That fight was hopeless, took the advice, and fled.
<lb/>They left his flag but he himself departed,
<lb/>And went in haste toward Machin and <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>The armies came together face to face,
<lb/>The earth grew like a darksome cloud, anon
<lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName> shouted to his host :—
<lb/><q>Take not your bows and arrows or your spears,
<pb n="266"/>
<lb/>But battle with the mace and scimitar,
<lb/>And show a prowess worthy of your standing.
<lb/>Is it the time for pards to shun the fray
<lb/>When they perceive the quarry in the lair?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The soldiers left their spears upon the mount,
<lb/>And, shouting, made the dales and plains of fight
<lb/>Impassable with corpses. Half the living
<lb/>Asked quarter, and the others fled pell-mell ;
<lb/>There was no shepherd and the flock was scattered ;
<lb/>The plain was filled with handless, neckless trunks.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> spake and said: <q> Enough are slain.
<lb/>These changes are the lot of all, at whiles
<lb/>Producing bane, at whiles the antidote.
<lb/>Put off your arms and do more good henceforth.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1045"/>
<lb/>Why set your hearts upon this Wayside Inn,

<lb/>And then is like a bride all scent and colour?
<lb/>Choose calm, untroubled lives, for who can say

<p><lb/>He chose gold, silver, raiment yet unworn,

<lb/>Took for himself crowns, musk, and ambergris,

<lb/>That none could murmur at the lack of beasts.

<lb/>And entered on their march toward <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>A host thus decked with colour and perfume.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1046"/>
<lb/>As soon as news of <persName>Rustam</persName> reached the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>A shout came from the city and the court,

<lb/>Proclaiming that the lord of mace and mail

<lb/>Among all classes and degrees of men.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s heart grew like Paradise above,
<lb/>He offered praises to Almighty God,
<lb/>Bade bring the elephants, and journeyed forth.
<lb/>The world was decked according to the custom,
<lb/>Wine, harp, and minstrelsy were in request,
<lb/>The necks of all the elephants that went
<lb/>Were drenched with saffron, musk, and wine. The drivers
<lb/>Wore coronets upon their heads, and earrings
<lb/>Depended from their ears. Men poured down saffron
<lb/>And drachms, and sifted ambergris on musk.
<lb/>When matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> saw the exalted crown,
<lb/>While all around was echoing applause,
<lb/>He lighted from his steed and did obeisance.
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> inquired about the tedious march,

<p><lb/>They spread the tables and the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> said smiling :—

<lb/>He set wine on the board, called minstrelsy,

<lb/>The twisted lasso and the wrestling-bout,

<p>
<lb/>The poet half apologises for introducing this story into the
<lb/><rs type="title">Shahnama</rs>, but pleads that we live in a world of wonders. The tale runs thus: Complaints are brought to <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> of the ravages made among the herds by a certain onager which the
<lb/><rs type="role">Shah</rs> perceives to be the div <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>. Accordingly he sends
<lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> to the rescue, who is, however, taken at a disadvantage by the div, and only saves his life by his ready wit. He then falls in with Afrdsiyib and his meiny, and defeats them single- handed. Afterward he again encounters <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>, slays him, and returns home in triumph.</p>

<p>This story is a variation on the theme <q>the devil is an ass.</q>
<persName>Firdausi</persName>. probably introduced it into the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs> to explain the references in Part V. <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> uses, <q>the boulder of the div <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>,</q> to cover the entrance of the pit in which <persName>Bizhan</persName> is imprisoned. <persName>Rustam</persName>, when he comes to deliver <persName>Bizhan</persName>, is represented as lifting the stone single-handed and flinging it far away.' <ref target="n.271.1"/>
In <rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs> theology <rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs> was supposed to be surrounded by impersonations of his own divine qualities, who were known as the Ameshaspentas, <q>the immortal well-doers.</q> They were six in number, and among them was one named Vohu Manau, i.e.
Good Thought. Corresponding to these on <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>’s side were six impersonations of his evil qualities, one of which was Akem
Manau, i.e. Bad Thought. These good and evil impersonations were opposed to one another in pairs. Vohu Manau, for instance, was antagonised by Akem Manau. It has been suggested by
<note n="271.1">See pp. 309, 345.</note>
<pb n="272"/>
Professor Naldeke that Akwiin is a mistake of <persName>Firdausi</persName> or of his authorities for Akumdn, and that the div Akwiin is really none other than Akem Manau in disguise.<ref target="n.272.1"/> Similarly Aaishma daéva

<lb/>In many words to make thy path mine own,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<head>How <persName>Khusrau</persName> summoned <persName>Rustam</persName> to fight the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> Alwan</head>
<p>
<lb/>Thus saith the storying minstrel: <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>One morn adorned his Rose-bed like the spring.
<lb/>Such chieftains as <persName>Gudarz</persName>,  <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Barzin</persName> son of <persName>Garshasp</persName>, sprung from <persName>Jamshid</persName>,
<lb/>With <persName>Giv</persName> and with <persName>Ruhham</persName> the veteran,
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> and sage <persName>Kharrad</persName> sat with the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And drained the goblet to the king of kings
<lb/>Right merrily. One hour of day had passed .
<lb/>When there arrived a herdsman from the plain,
<lb/>Who came before <persName>Khusrau</persName>, first kissed the ground,
<lb/>And then addressed that <rs type="role">Shah</rs> of glorious race :—
<lb/><q>An onager hath come amongst the herds,
<lb/>And seemeth like a div escaped from bond!
<lb/>Thou wouldest say: <q>It is a savage lion!</q>
<lb/>He breaketh our steeds' necks; he is in colour
<lb/>As 'twere the sun itself; thou wouldest say :—
<lb/><q>The sky hath washed him in a bath of gold</q>
<lb/>Drawn from his neck and reaching to his tail
<lb/>There is a line as black as musk. If thou
<lb/>Wouldst judge by his round haunches and his feet
<lb/>Thou wouldest say: <q> He is a noble steed.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName>, aware that 'twas no onager,
<pb n="274"/>
<lb/>For onagers surpass not steeds in strength,
<lb/>And having heard that people near the stream,
<lb/>Where this man used to turn the herds to graze,
<lb/>Made much complaint about <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> the dfv,
<lb/>Said to the hind: <q>This is no onager,
<lb/>And I have knowledge of it. Go thy way.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then addressed the chiefs: <q> Ye paladins,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1051"/>
<lb/>With <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and state! we need one lion-fierce
<lb/>Among yourselves to go on this emprise.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He scanned the warriors but found none to please him,
<lb/>For only <persName>Rustam</persName> son of <persName>Zal</persName> could help
<lb/>In such a cause, and so <persName>Khusrau</persName> prepared
<lb/>A letter couched in just and loving terms,
<lb/>And gave it to <persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad,
<lb/>To whom he said: <q> Bear to the son of <persName>Zal</persName>
<lb/>My letter, go like smoke both night and day,
<lb/>And slumber not within <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName>.
<lb/>Greet <persName>Rustam</persName> much and lovingly from me,
<lb/>Say to him: <q> Live while heaven itself shall last,</q>
<lb/>And add when he hath read the letter through :—
<lb/><q>My <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> is all from thee, aspiring chief!
<lb/>Show us thy face, arise, and come. When thou
<lb/>Hast read the letter stay not in <placeName>Zabul</placeName>.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> departed like a rushing wind,
<lb/>Or onager in terror for its life,
<lb/>And gave the letter when he reached the chieftain,
<lb/>Who heard, obeyed, and went to court in state,
<lb/>There kissed the ground before the throne and blessed
<lb/>The imperial fortunes, saying thus: <q>O <rs type="role">Shah</rs>!
<lb/>Thou calledst me, and here ain I girt up
<lb/>To do thy will. Be might and goodness thine.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName>, on seeing <persName>Rustam</persName>, welcomed him,
<lb/>Gave him a seat upon the royal throne,
<lb/>And afterward spake thus: <q>O paladin!
<lb/>Mayst thou live ever glad and bright of soul.
<pb n="275"/>
<lb/>This day is blesséd since I look on thee:
<lb/>My fortunes all depend on thy shrewd mind.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1052"/>
<lb/>A work is toward, O elephantine one!
<lb/>For which I summoned thee of all the mighty,
<lb/>So that, if thou distaste not my command,
<lb/>Thou mayest gird thee to win crown and treasure.
<lb/>A hind hath said: <q>An onager hath come
<lb/>Among the herds.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> told o'er the tale,
<lb/>And added: <q> Now, O matchless one, make ready
<lb/>And undertake this further enterprise.
<lb/>Go, and in dealing with it have a care,
<lb/>For it may be malicious <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>.</q>
<lb/><q>Through thy good fortune,</q> <persName>Rustam</persName> made reply,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> went in Quest of the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs></head>
<p>
<lb/>He went forth like a lion to the chase,
<lb/>A lasso on his arm and under him
<lb/>A <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>, went to where that hind was tending
<lb/>His cattle and that div was roaming loose.<ref target="n.275.1"/>
<lb/>Three days he searched the champaign mid the steeds,
<lb/>And on the fourth perceived a Thing careering,
<lb/>And rushing by him like the north wind’s blast.
<lb/>It was a glossy beast of golden hue,
<lb/>But with fell mischief neath its hide. Then <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Spurred fleet-foot <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> but thought as he drew near :—
<lb/><q>I need not cast but noose it with my lasso;
<lb/>There is no call to spoil it with the sword;
<lb/>I will convey it living to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.</q></p>
<note n="275.1">Reading with P.</note>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1053"/>
<pb n="276"/>
<p><lb/>So <persName>Rustam</persName> flung his royal lasso forth,
<lb/>Intent to take the creature by the head.
<lb/>The lusty onager perceived the noose,
<lb/>And vanished instantly. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> knew :—
<lb/><q>This is no onager; I must proceed
<lb/>By craft not force. It is <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> himself,
<lb/>And I must smite him with a whiff of steel.
<lb/>The sages told me that this is his haunt,
<lb/>But his appearance as an onager
<lb/>Is strange! The scimitar must now avail
<lb/>To make blood overflow that yellow gold.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Just then the onager appeared again ;
<lb/>Again the chieftain urged his swift career,
<lb/>Strung up his bow and from his wind-like steed
<lb/>Let fly an arrow like <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>,
<lb/>But even as he drew his royal bow
<lb/>The onager was gone the second time.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> rode about the open plain
<lb/>A day and night in want of sustenance,
<lb/>And nodding in the saddle, till he found
<lb/>A fountain like rose-water. Lighting there
<lb/>He watered <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and sank to sleep fordone,
<lb/>But first ungirthed his steed, took off the saddle
<lb/>To use its poplar pummel as his pillow,
<lb/>And spread beside the spring his saddle-cloth
<lb/>For sleep while <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> to pasturage sped forth.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<head>How the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs> <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> flung <persName>Rustam</persName> into the Sea</head>
<p>
<lb/>When from afar <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> saw <persName>Rustam</persName> sleeping
<lb/>He came as swift as wind, delved round about
<lb/>The place where <persName>Rustam</persName> lay, and raised it skyward.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> woke from sleep he woke to sorrow,
<lb/>And his wise head was filled with consternation.
<pb n="277"/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1054"/>
<lb/>He thought: <q>So this foul div hath laid for me
<lb/>A snare like this! Woe for my strength and courage,
<lb/>My neck, and blows with mace and scimitar !
<lb/>This matter will make desolate the world,
<lb/>Achieving all <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>’s desire,
<lb/>While <persName>Tus</persName>, Guidarz, <persName>Khusrau</persName>, the throne and crown,
<lb/>The elephants and drums, will be no more.
<lb/>Through me the world will suffer, since <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>
<lb/>Hath spoiled my marketing. Who will take vengeance
<lb/>On this curst div? No one will match him now.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then said <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> to <persName>Rustam</persName> in his plight :—
<lb/><q>Now, elephantine chieftain! take thy choice
<lb/>To fall upon the mountains or the waves;
<lb/>So whither shall I fling thee far from men?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The elephantine hero communed thus :—
<lb/><q>In every case naught bettereth artifice.
<lb/>He will do contrary to what I say;
<lb/>He will not recognise an oath or keep
<lb/>A pact. If I say, <q>Throw me in the sea,</q>
<lb/>Then will this evil-natured <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>
<lb/>Fling me upon the mountains, dash me there
<lb/>To pieces, and destroy me. I must use
<lb/>Some scheme to make him fling me into water,</q>
<lb/>Then said: <q>A sage of <placeName>Chin</placeName> hath spoken well :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1055"/>
<lb/><q>Whoe'er is drowned his soul will never see
<lb/>Surtsh in Paradise, his lot will be
<lb/>To tarry in his place in misery,
<lb/>And not to find a welcome to the sky.</q>
<lb/>Let me not therefore fall upon the ocean
<lb/>To make the fishes' maws my winding-sheet,
<lb/>But drop me on the mountains that the lions
<lb/>And tigers may behold a brave man’s hands,</q>
<lb/><rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> at this roared like the sea, and answered :—
<lb/><q>Now will I fling thee to the place wherein
<lb/>Thou wilt be lost for ever to both worlds.</q>
<lb/>And, acting contrary to <persName>Rustam</persName>’s words.
<pb n="278"/>
<lb/>Dropped him upon the sea. As <persName>Rustam</persName> fell
<lb/>He drew his sword, and when the crocodiles
<lb/>Approached they turned aside from fighting him.
<lb/>He struck out with his feet and his left hand
<lb/>While with his right he fought his way along,
<lb/>Not resting for a moment from his toils,
<lb/>But acting as a warrior in all.
<lb/>If valour could avert the fatal day
<lb/>Time had not taken <persName>Rustam</persName>’s stance away,
<lb/>But know that circling time is ever thus—
<lb/>At whiles all sweet, at whiles all venomous.
<lb/>He struggled bravely, reached the shore, beheld
<lb/>The desert, and gave.praises to the Maker,
<lb/>Who had delivered thus His slave from ill.
<lb/>He rested, took his armour off, and laid
<lb/>His tiger-skin cuirass beside the stream.
<lb/>Whenas his lasso and his armour dried
<lb/>That savage Lion donned his coat of mail,
<lb/>And went back to the stream where he had slept
<lb/>When that malignant div had raged at him;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1056"/>
<lb/>But glossy <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> was nowhere in the mead,
<lb/>And <persName>Rustam</persName>, wroth and raging at his luck,
<lb/>Went plodding doggedly with reins and saddle
<lb/>In <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>’s track till in his quest he came
<lb/>Upon a meadow-land of streams and shaws
<lb/>Well stocked with francolins and cooing doves.
<lb/>The herdsman of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> who kept
<lb/>The steeds lay fast asleep within a coppice,
<lb/>While <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> was prancing madly like a div
<lb/>Among the herd and neighing. <persName>Rustam</persName> cast
<lb/>His royal lasso, caught <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> by the head,
<lb/>Then rubbed the dust away and saddled him,
<lb/>With thanks to God, the Giver of all good,
<lb/>Put on the bridle, mounted, took in hand
<lb/>His trenchant scimitar, and drove the herd
<lb/>Therewith, still calling on the name of God.
<pb n="279"/>
<lb/>The herdsman, at the tumult, raised his head,
<lb/>Still half asleep, and called the horsemen with him
<lb/>To mount upon their lofty-crested steeds.
<lb/>They took each man his lasso and his bow
<lb/>To learn what foe dared come upon the pasture,
<lb/>And to approach so many cavaliers.
<lb/>These went together hotly in pursuit
<lb/>To strip the warlike Lion of his hide,
<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName>, when he saw them rushing on,
<lb/>Drew quickly from his waist his vengeful sword,
<lb/>Roared like a lion, and proclaimed : <q> My name
<lb/>Is <persName>Rustam</persName> son of <persName>Zal</persName> the son of <persName>Sam</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He slew the more part with his scimitar,
<lb/>Which when the herdsman saw he showed his back,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1057"/>
<lb/>It happened strangely that <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Had sped forth like a blast to view his steeds,
<lb/>And brought with him wine, harps, and warriors
<lb/>To merrymake upon the watered plain
<lb/>Where every year the herdsman loosed the herds.
<lb/>The monarch on arriving saw them not.
<lb/>Then suddenly rose clamour, horse on horse
<lb/>Passed, and <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> saw far away
<lb/>The dust of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>, and other noble chargers.
<lb/>The ancient herdsman rushed up franticly
<lb/>In evil plight and wounded by an arrow,
<lb/>Then in amazement told <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Though single-handed, <persName>Rustam</persName> hath borne off

<p><lb/>The <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs> clamoured: <q> He is all alone,

<lb/>Have we become so wretched, weak, and frail
<lb/>That one can shed our blood? The very herds
<lb/>Will shame thereat! We cannot let it pass.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The monarch with four elephants and troops
<lb/>Went in pursuit of <persName>Rustam</persName> who, when they
<lb/>Had overtaken him, took from his arm
<lb/>His bow and charged against them furiously.
<lb/>He rained upon them, as the clouds rain hail,
<lb/>Shafts from his bow and strokes from his steel sword.
<lb/>He dropped his arrows and his scimitar,
<lb/>When sixty gallant chiefs had been o'erthrown,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1058"/>
<lb/>And taking up his mace slew forty more.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> in dudgeon showed his back
<lb/>While <persName>Rustam</persName> took the four white elephants.
<lb/>The warriors of <placeName>Turan</placeName> were in despair,
<lb/>For <persName>Rustam</persName> came behind them with his mace,
<lb/>And, like a cloud in spring, for two leagues onward
<lb/>Rained blows like hail and beat in helms and casques.
<lb/>He turned back, driving off the elephants
<lb/>And herds, and took the baggage-train withal,
<lb/>Yet when he went back to the spring at leisure
<lb/>His valiant heart was ready still for fight !
<lb/>The div <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> again encountered him,
<lb/>And said: <q> Art thou not surfeited with strife ?
<lb/>Thou hast escaped the ocean and the claws
<lb/>Of crocodiles, and come back to the waste
<lb/>To battle. Now shalt thou behold thy fate,
<lb/>For never shalt thou seek to fight henceforth.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The peerless <persName>Rustam</persName>, hearing what the div
<lb/>Said, roared out like a lion of the fray,
<lb/>Released his twisted lasso from its straps,
<lb/>Flung it, and caught the div about the waist ;
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName>, turning in his saddle, raised
<lb/>His mace as 'twere the hammer of a smith,
<pb n="281"/>
<lb/>And smote the div like some mad elephant
<lb/>Upon his head and smashed it, brains and neck ;
<lb/>The hero lighted, drew his blue steel sword
<lb/>And cut the div’s head off, then offered up
<lb/>Thanksgivings to Almighty God through Whom
<lb/>He had achieved the victory that day.
<lb/>Know thou that every one that is the thrall
<lb/>Of ill, and offereth not to God his praise,
<lb/>And whosoever doth transgress the ways
<lb/>Of manhood, is a div, not man at all.
<lb/>The wisdom that rejecteth what I tell
<lb/>May miss the goodly inner sense as well :
<lb/>If then a paladin be full of might—
<lb/>A man of lusty limbs and lofty height—
<lb/>Let him, and not <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>, thy hero be,
<lb/>And let thy tongue tell tales of chivalry.

<lb/>And strong. The waste became a sea with blood,
<lb/>Which spurted, when I had beheaded him,
<lb/>Up to the welkin and came down like rain!</q></p>
<pb n="283"/>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> amazed put by his cup,
<lb/>And gave God thanks for such a paladin,
<lb/>Since none had seen such wonders—that a man
<lb/>Such as was <persName>Rustam</persName> should exist at all
<lb/>Tn all his manliness and mien and stature.
<lb/>He said: <q> Unless the Lord had given me
<lb/>A share both in His justice and His love
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1061"/>
<lb/>I never should have had a liege like this
<lb/>With whom to hunt down divs and elephants.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus spent they two weeks joyfully; their talk
<lb/>Was all of wine and banquet. On the third
<lb/>The matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> purposed to go home
<lb/>Victorious and glad. <q>I yearn for <persName>Zal</persName>,
<lb/>The son of <persName>Sam</persName>,</q> he said, <q>and such desire
<lb/>May not be blinked, but I will go apace,
<lb/>And come back to the court. We must prepare
<lb/>Fresh vengeance, for revenge for <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>Is not thus easily to be forgone
<lb/>By taking steeds and herds.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The world’s great king
<lb/>Unlocked the portal of his treasury,
<lb/>Brought forth the precious jewels hoarded there,
<lb/>And filled a cup with treasure. Of king’s raiment
<lb/>Five changes made throughout of cloth of gold,
<lb/>With golden-girdled slave-boys brought from Rim,
<lb/>And likewise hanamaids decked with golden torques,
<lb/>With tapestries and thrones of ivory,
<lb/>Embroideries, dinars, and turquoise crowns,
<lb/>All these the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> sent <persName>Rustam</persName>, saying: <q>Take
<lb/>This gift with thee, but stay with us to-day,
<lb/>And afterward make ready to depart.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They spent the day together quaffing wine,
<lb/>But <persName>Rustam</persName> was resolved to go at dawn.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> went two days with him and embraced him
<lb/>At parting. <persName>Rustam</persName> cottoned to the road,
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> returned. Well ordered 'neath his signet

<lb/>The world became as he would have it be.

<div type="textpart" subtype="part" n="5"><head>THE STORY OF BIZHAN AND MANIZHA</head>
<div type="textpart" n="argument"><head>Argument</head>
<p><lb/>The poet describes how the tale was first told to him to while away the depression caused bya sleepless night, and then narrates as follows: <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> at a feast receives a petition for succour from the people of Irmin, whose country is being ravaged by wild boars, and sends <persName>Bizhan</persName> and <persName>Gurgin</persName> to clear the country of them. <persName>Bizhan</persName>, through the machinations of <persName>Gurgin</persName>, who envies him, falls in love with Afrasiyib’s daughter Manizha, who carries off <persName>Bizhan</persName> to <placeName>Turan</placeName> and hides him in her palace.
<lb/>He is discovered and imprisoned in a pit with Manizha as his attendant. In the meantime <persName>Gurgin</persName> has returned to <placeName>Iran</placeName>, where his lame story rouses suspicion. <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, by means of the divining-cup, ascertains the situation of <persName>Bizhan</persName> and despatches
<lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> to deliver him. This <persName>Rustam</persName> achieves, <persName>Gurgin</persName> is pardoned by <persName>Bizhan</persName>, <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> is defeated, and all ends happily.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" n="intro"><head>Note</head>
<p>For the historical basis of this story, see p. II.
The tale of <persName>Bizhan</persName> and Manizha is the second of the great love-stories of the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs>, that of <persName>Zal</persName> and <persName>Rudaba</persName> in Vol. I. being the first,<ref target="n.285.1"/> and that of Gushtdsp in Rim, which will be given in Vol. IV., being the third. Mohl probably is right in considering the present story to be one of <persName>Firdausi</persName>’s early works,
<q>Le caractére de fraîcheur qui se remarque dans ce récit s’accorde bien avec la supposition que cet épisode est une ceuvre de la jeunesse de Firdousi; et la versification porte quelques traces de manque d’experience, telles que l'emploi fréquent de l'élif final ajouté à cause de la rime ou du métre. Cet expédient est recu dans la poésie persane ; mais Firdousi n’en fait nulle part autant d’usage qu’au commencement de histoire de Bijen et de
Menijeh.</q><ref target="n.285.2"/>

<pb n="286"/>
The point as to the terminal alif perhaps may be exemplified sufficiently for the English reader by the following stanza :—
<lg><l>Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,</l>
<l>And merrily hent the stile-a:</l>
<l>A merry heart goes all the day,</l>
<l>Your sad tires in a mile-a.<ref target="n.286.1"/></l></lg>
As in the English so in the <rs type="ethnic">Persian</rs> an <q>a</q> is added arbitrarily to help out the metre, but the analogy is not exact.
In addition to Mohl’s reasons given above we may adduce the bold <rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs> allusions—the outcome perhaps of a youthful enthusiasm.<ref target="n.286.2"/> The loss of <persName>Bizhan</persName> too is regarded as the first serious trouble of the Gudarzian family,<ref target="n.286.3"/> though it would not be prudent to lay much stress upon that in the absence of other indications.
§ 1. In Mohl’s opinion the friend referred to both here and in the Prelude to the <rs type="title">Shahnama</rs> (§ 10) was <persName>Muhammad</persName> Lashkari.<ref target="n.286.4"/>
<persName>Firdausi</persName>, however, has left the sex indeterminate.
Harut was an angel who, with his mate Mirtit, was suspended by the feet in a well at <placeName>Babylon</placeName> for practising magic arts.
§ 2. Such an appeal would be characteristic of the Armenians
(Irminians) who, broken by adversity, ceased long ago to be a self-reliant people.
§§ 10 and 23. For the div <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs> see Part IV.
§ 12. According to <rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs> belief divine beings, men, the lower animals, plants, waters, sun and moon, etc., all had their immortal principle, known as their fravashi. These fravashis were worshipped especially at the beginning of the <rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs> year, and the month <rs type="month">Farwardin</rs> obtained its name from the practice. At this season the spirits of deceased ancestors were supposed to revisit the houses of their descendants, and such fravashis, like the manes of the Romans, were objects of peculiar veneration.
§17. The divine beings whose blessings are invoked by
<persName>Rustam</persName> on <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> are members of a class formerly known as Yazatas (gods) and now as Izads. Some of them, among other functions, presided over the <rs type="religion">Zoroastrian</rs> Calendar, and gave their names to the days of the month and to the months of the year.<ref target="n.286.5"/> They may be regarded as celestial satraps among whom the divine qualities and the good creation of <rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs> have been parcelled out. <persName>Bahman</persName> presides over Good Thought, Ardi- bihisht over Perfect Rectitude, Shahrir over Perfect Rule,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1065"/>
<lb/>The night was like jet dipped in pitch, there lent
<lb/>No planet lustre to the firmament,
<lb/>The moon, appearing in her new array
<lb/>In readiness to take her throneward way,
<lb/>Much brightness lost by sojourning below ;
<lb/>Her waist was shrunk, her heart was full of woe,
<lb/>Her crown was well-nigh lapis-lazuli ;
<lb/>Through rust and dust she journeyed through the sky.
<lb/>Night's retinue had spread out everywhere
<lb/>A carpet black as raven’s plumes, the air
<lb/>Was like rust-eaten steel ; thou wouldst have cried :—
<lb/><q>Its face is smirched with pitch!</q> On every side,
<lb/>Like some black serpent with its jaws stretched wide,
<lb/>Was very <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>, each sigh of whom
<lb/>Was like a negro making charcval fume.
<lb/>The garden and the stream’s lip seemed to be
<lb/>Like billows surging on a pitchy sea
<lb/>O'er which the circling heaven paused wonderingly.
<lb/>The sun had lost its power; thou wouldst have said :—
<lb/><q>Karth sleepeth with a pitch-like robe o'erspread.</q>
<lb/>The world’s heart trembled at itself; no sounds
<lb/>Were heard but watchmen ringing on their rounds;
<lb/>The birds refrained from song, the beasts were still,
<lb/>The world’s lips closed alike for good or ill,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1066"/>
<lb/>And height and depth were lost. Amid the woes
<lb/>Of that long vigil strait at heart I rose.
<lb/>I had one in the house, a loving wight,
<note n="287.1">See p. 271. </note>
<note n="287.2">See above.</note>
<pb n="288"/>
<lb/>To whom I called and bade to bring a light.
<lb/>Descending to the garden presently
<lb/>My darling Idol came and said to me :—
<lb/><q>What need for light? Will sleep not visit thee?</q></p>
<p><lb/>I said: <q> Mine Idol! I am not at one
<lb/>With slumber. Bring a candle like the sun,
<lb/>Set it in front of me, then spread the board,
<lb/>Take up the harp, and let the wine be poured.</q></p>
<p><lb/>My darling Idol fetched me lamps a-shine,
<lb/>Fetched quinces, oranges, pomegranates, wine,
<lb/>And one bright goblet fit for king of kings,
<lb/>Then plied at whiles the wine, at whiles the strings,
<lb/><q>Harut performed enchantment,</q> thou hadst said,
<lb/>My heart grew victor over drearihead,
<lb/>And it seemed day with me in dark night’s stead.
<lb/>Hear what my loving comrade said to me
<lb/>What time the goblet had joined company.
<lb/>Thus said to me that sun-faced Moon of mine :—
<lb/><q>May heaven have joyance of that life of thine.
<lb/>Quaff thou thy wine while from this volume’s store
<lb/>I will read out to thee a tale of yore.
<lb/>Or ever part thereof shall reach thine ear
<lb/>Thou wilt admire the process of the Sphere.
<lb/>The theme is love, spell, war, and stratagem,
<lb/>All worthy that a sage should list to them.</q>
<lb/><q>O Moon-face!</q> said I to that Cypress-stem,
<lb/><q>Recite, recite,</q> who answered: <q>That will I,
<lb/>And thou shalt weave it into poetry.</q></p>

<head>How the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> appealed to <persName>Khusrau</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>When <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> went forth to take revenge,
<lb/>And sought to change the order of the world,
<lb/>The throne and state departed from <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>But his throne topped the sun because he leagued
<lb/>Heaven and <placeName>Iran</placeName> together, and lavished love
<lb/>Upon the noble race, the age renewed
<lb/>Its youth and bathed his face in loyalty ;
<lb/>And though the prudent maketh not his couch
<lb/>A torrent-bed though dry, yet for a while
<lb/>The more part of the world acknowledged him
<lb/>That sought to be avenged for <persName>Siyawush</persName>.
<lb/>One day he sat carousing in his joy,
<lb/>And drinking to the warriors of the host.
<lb/>His throne was ornate with brocade, a crown
<lb/>Of gems was on his head, and in his hand
<lb/>A jewelled cup of wine. Thus, all enraptured,
<lb/>He listened to the harp. The nobles present
<lb/>Were <persName>Fariburz</persName> the son of <persName>Kai Kaus</persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1068"/>
<lb/>And <persName>Gustaham</persName>, <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad, Farhad, and <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Shapur</persName> the brave, <persName>Tus</persName>, shatterer of hosts—
<lb/>Head of the scions of <persName>Naudar</persName>—<persName>Kharrad</persName>,
<lb/>And bold <persName>Bizhan</persName>. These loyal paladins
<lb/>Had royal wine in hand. Inside the goblets
<lb/>The wine was like carnelian of <placeName>Yaman</placeName>,
<lb/>And in the midst were handfuls of dog-roses.
<lb/>Before <persName>Khusrau</persName> stood slaves with fairy-faces,
<pb n="290"/>
<lb/>Whose musk-black ringlets fell on skins of jasmine.
<lb/>The banquet-hall was decked, and in the presence
<lb/>Girt for attendance stood the chamberlain.
<lb/>Approaching him discreetly from the curtain
<lb/>An usher said: <q>Irmdnians wait without—
<lb/>Chiefs of the march between this and <placeName>Turan</placeName>:
<lb/>They fain would have an audience of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>For they have travelled far to seek redress.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The prudent chamberlain approached the throne,
<lb/>Announced his tidings, sought the royal pleasure,
<lb/>And introduced the envoys in due form.
<lb/>They came before the presence of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>With tears and cries for aid; their arms were folded,
<lb/>Their faces swept the ground; as they drew nigh
<lb/>They said: <q>O <rs type="role">Shah</rs> triumphant ! live for ever,
<lb/>For thou art worthy of unending life.
<lb/>We come for succour from a distant land,
<lb/>Khan-i-Irman, between this and <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>And bring this message: <q> Ever live, O <rs type="role">Shah</rs>!
<lb/>In every clime the succourer from the evil,
<lb/>O'er all seven climes the king, and in each state
<lb/>The help against the bad. <placeName>Turan</placeName> and we
<lb/>Confine, which is a source of bale to us,
<lb/>While toward <placeName>Iran</placeName> there was a forest-tract—
<lb/>Our present cause of trouble. What a wealth
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1069"/>
<lb/>Of cultivated lands was ours therein,
<lb/>And fruit trees, our chief means of sustenance !
<lb/>Now do us right, O monarch of <placeName>Iran</placeName>!
<lb/>Because wild boars in numbers numberless,
<lb/>With tusks like elephants</q>, and big as hills,
<lb/>Have seized on all those woods and meads, and put
<lb/>The country of Irman in consternation.
<lb/>What mighty ruin have they brought on us
<lb/>Both in our cattle and our growing crops !
<lb/>The boars delight in rending with their tusks
<lb/>The cultivated trees whereof we speak.
<pb n="291"/>
<lb/>Hard stones will not withstand such tusks, and fortune
<lb/>May be hath utterly abandoned us !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Now when the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> had heard the suppliants' words
<lb/>He was much grieved and, pitying them, addressed
<lb/>The exalted warriors: <q>Who among my chiefs
<lb/>And mighty men is eager for renown ?
<lb/>Let such depart to yon boar-wasted forest,
<lb/>And, all intent on fame and combating,
<lb/>Behead them with his sword. I will not grudge him
<lb/>My gems and other treasures.</q></p>
<p><lb/>At his bidding
<lb/>The treasurer laid upon the dais a salver
<lb/>Of gold whereon they showered mingled gems ;
<lb/>They brought ten steeds, whose brand-mark was <q> <persName>Kaus</persName>,</q>
<lb/>With golden bridles, trapped them with brocade
<lb/>Of <placeName>Rum</placeName>, and called the nobles from the throng.
<lb/><q>O men of name and worship!</q> said earth’s king,
<lb/><q>What man will make my toil his own and then
<lb/>My treasure his ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>None answered him a word
<lb/>Except the son of <persName>Giv</persName> of glorious race—
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>—who stood forth midst the warriors,
<lb/>And called God’s blessing down upon the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> :—
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1070"/>
<lb/><q>Ne'er may thy palace see another master,
<lb/>And be thy bidding done throughout the world.
<lb/>I will adventure on this enterprise
<lb/>At thy command: I only live for thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, who was standing by, marked with displeasure
<lb/>His son’s words, called down blessings on the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>Then took <persName>Bizhan</persName> to task: <q>What boyishness
<lb/>Is this, and this conceit of thine own might ?
<lb/>A youth may have both wit and native worth,
<lb/>But he must train to win accomplishment ;
<lb/>He must exhaust all kinds of good and ill,
<lb/>Must taste of every salt and bitter. Go not,
<pb n="292"/>
<lb/>By paths that thou hast never trodden or brag
<lb/>Before the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> so recklessly.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>Shrewd, though impulsive, and of sleepless fortune,
<lb/>Replied in anger : <q> My victorious sire!
<lb/>Impute not weakness to me in thy thoughts,
<lb/>But bear with what I tell thee: I am young
<lb/>In enterprise but I am old in counsel,
<lb/>And I, <persName>Bizhan</persName>, who am the son of <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>The army-shatterer, will behead the boars.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> rejoiced thereat, invoked God’s blessing,
<lb/>Bade him depart, and said: <q>Thou man of worship!
<lb/>Thou art a buckler ever 'gainst all ill.
<lb/>The lord that hath such lieges as thou art
<lb/>Would be a fool to fear a foe.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then
<lb/>Said to <persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad: <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>Is ignorant of the road toward Irman,
<lb/>So bear him company with mule and steed

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1071"/>
<lb/>He took with him <persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad
<lb/>To help in battle and in time of need,
<lb/>And left the court with cheetahs and with hawks
<lb/>To hunt withal upon his longsome journey.
<lb/>Like foaming lion he fared and took the heads
<lb/>From onager and antelope; the plain
<lb/>Was thick with wild sheep torn; their hearts and breasts
<lb/>Felt the warm impress of the cheetah’s claws.
<pb n="293"/>
<lb/>His lasso ringed the necks of onagers,
<lb/>He seemed like Tahmutras who bound the <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>,
<lb/>While overhead the pheasants clutched by falcons
<lb/>Dyed jasmine-leaves with blood. Thus sped the twain,

<lb/>Now when <persName>Bizhan</persName> cast eyes thereon the blood
<lb/>Boiled in him with excitement, while the boars
<lb/>Roamed freely, knowing not: <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName> hath mounted.</q>
<lb/>On drawing near the forest to attack
<lb/>He spake thus to <persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad :—
<lb/><q>Go thou inside or stand aside, and when
<lb/>I go to shoot the boars seek yonder pool.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1072"/>
<lb/>Then, when a tumult riseth from the wood,
<lb/>Take up thy mace, be ware, and with one blow
<lb/>Behead each boar escaping.</q></p>
<p><lb/>But <persName>Gurgin</persName>,
<lb/>The warrior, answered: <q>Such was not the compact
<lb/>With our young <rs type="role">Shah</rs>. Thou hadst the jewels, silver,

<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> heard with amaze, his outlook darkened,
<lb/>But lion-like he went inside the forest,
<lb/>Undaunted strung his bow, roared mightily
<lb/>As 'twere a cloud in spring, and brought the leaves
<lb/>Down like a shower of rain, then sword in hand
<lb/>Like some mad elephant he chased the boars
<lb/>While they rushed at him, tusking up the earth.
<lb/>Then came one boar, a very Abriman,
<lb/>Whose tushes cut through trees like files through stone,
<lb/>And rent his hauberk while the reek of fight
<lb/>Rose o'er the mead. <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s sword smote the boar
<lb/>And clave its elephantine form. The beasts
<lb/>So fierce before grew fox-like; all were stained
<lb/>With blood from sword-cuts; they had had enough

<lb/>Of combating. <persName>Bizhan</persName> cut off their heads,

<lb/>And furthermore, in order to display

<lb/>That matter grieved his heart, he feared disgrace,

<lb/>Manizha, daughter of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>Will make that garden radiant as the sun,
<lb/>And with a hundred hanamaids—perfect pictures,
<lb/>All daughters of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>, modest maids,
<lb/>As tall as cypress-trees, with musky hair,
<lb/>And cheeks like roses, dreamy eyes, and wine
<lb/>That savoureth rose-water on their lips—
<lb/>Will set up her pavilion on yon meadows.
<lb/>Thou wilt behold the plain bedecked throughout
<lb/>With riches like an idol-house in <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>Now if we go toward that pleasure-ground,
<lb/>And hurry o'er the journey in one day,
<lb/>We may bear off some of those fay-faced damsels,
<lb/>And win the approbation of <persName>Khusrau</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>In this wise spake <persName>Gurgin</persName>. <persName>Bizhan</persName> was young,
<lb/>And all the paladin was stirred in him.
<lb/>He was a youth and followed youthful fashion,
<lb/>Some whiles pursuing fame and some whiles passion.

<head>How <persName>Bizhan</persName> went to see Manizha, Daughter of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head><p><lb/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1075"/>
<lb/>They set off on the tedious Journey, one
<lb/>Led by desire, the other by revenge.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>, the refuge of the host, alighted
<lb/>Between two forests after one day’s march.
<lb/>He and <persName>Gurgin</persName> enjoyed two days with hawk
<lb/>And cheetah in those meadows of Irman.
<lb/>On hearing that that marriageable maid
<lb/>Had come, and decked the whole waste like the eye
<lb/>Of chanticleer, <persName>Gurgin</persName> informed <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>And told him of the minstrelsy and feasting,
<lb/>Whereat <q> Now will I,</q> thus <persName>Bizhan</persName> responded,
<lb/><q>Go forward and examine from a distance
<lb/>The scene and manner of the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>' revels;
<lb/>Then with my polished spear-head lifted skyward
<lb/>Will I turn rein. We shall advise the better,
<lb/>As feeling more assured, when we have seen.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade the treasurer: <q> Bring the crown that uscd,
<lb/>Worn by my sire, to light the banquet-hall,
<lb/>Because our way is banquet-ward. Bring likewise
<lb/>The earrings and the torque that <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>Bestowed on me, and <persName>Giv</persName>’s bejewelled armlet.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He donned a glittering tunic made in <placeName>Rum</placeName>,
<lb/>And stuck an eagle’s feather in his crown.
<lb/>They put the saddle on his steed Shabrang
<lb/>While he bade bring the girdle and the signet
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1076"/>
<lb/>That marked the paladin, and having mounted
<lb/>Went to the spot in haste.
<lb/>He reached the forest,
<lb/>His heart preoccupied with its desires,
<lb/>He drew anigh that Fair’s pavilion,
<lb/>Desire contending in his heart the while,
<lb/>And went beneath a lofty cypress-tree
<pb n="297"/>
<lb/>For shelter from the sun. The plain, with all
<lb/>Its sounds of harp and song gave, thou hadst said,
<lb/>His soul a weleome. When the fair one saw
<lb/>The visage of the chieftain from her tent—
<lb/>The cheeks as 'twere <rs type="heavenlybody">Canopus</rs> of <placeName>Yaman</placeName>,
<lb/>Or jasmine blossoming mid violets—
<lb/>While on his head he wore the crown that marked
<lb/>A chief of paladins, and all his breast
<lb/>Blazed with brocade of <placeName>Rum</placeName>, the maiden yearned
<lb/>For love of him, who came in quest of love,
<lb/>And sent her nurse as envoy, saying thus :—
<lb/><q>Go 'neath the boughs of yonder lofty cypress,
<lb/>And find out who he is—yon moonlike one.
<lb/>Can it be <persName>Siyawush</persName> returned to life,
<lb/>Or else a fairy? Question him and say :—
<lb/><q>How hast thou come and who hath brought thee hither ?
<lb/>Art thou of fairy-birth or <persName>Siyawush</persName>
<lb/>That thou dost fill our hearts with love for thee,
<lb/>For thou hast lit a raging fire of love,
<lb/>Unless the Resurrection be upon us,
<lb/>Because for years have I been holding revel
<lb/>Upon these meads each spring, and we have seen
<lb/>None in this pleasance; but I now see thee,
<lb/>O noble Cypress! and it is enough.</q>
<lb/>Say to him: <q> Whether thou art man or fairy
<lb/>Come to our festival. I have not looked
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1077"/>
<lb/>On aught resembling thee, O moon-faced one!
<lb/>Inform us of thy name and whence thou comest.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>The nurse, when she had come and done obeisance,
<lb/>Gave him Manizha’s message, and his cheeks
<lb/>Bloomed like the rose. He saw his wish achieved,
<lb/>And answered thus: <q>I am not <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>Or fairy-born, sweet-spoken messenger !
<lb/>But from <placeName>Iran</placeName>—the country of the free.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> am I, the son of <persName>Giv</persName>, and came
<pb n="298"/>
<lb/>All keenly thence to battle with wild boars,
<lb/>I took their heads and threw them by the way
<lb/>To bear their tushes to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>; but hearing
<lb/>About this pleasance did not hurry back
<lb/>To <persName>Giv</persName>, son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, if so good fortune
<lb/>Might show me though but in a dream the face
<lb/>Of her—the daughter of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> ;
<lb/>And now I see that all the plain is decked
<lb/>With treasures like an idol-house in <placeName>Chin</placeName>.
<lb/>If thou wilt show me kindness I will give thee
<lb/>A crown of gold with earrings and a girdle,
<lb/>And thou shalt lead me to yon lady fair,
<lb/>And bring her heart to love me.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She returned,
<lb/>And bore the secret to Manizha’s ear :—
<lb/><q>His countenance and mien are such and such,
<lb/>In such and such wise hath the Maker made him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Manizha sent an answer back forthwith:— _
<lb/><q>What seemed a fancy is within thy grasp,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1078"/>
<lb/>For now come to me with thy noble gait,
<lb/>And shed a light on this dark soul of mine.

<head>How <persName>Bizhan</persName> went to the Tent of Manizha</head>
<p>
<lb/>No room was left for further parleying.
<lb/>Forth from beneath the shadow of the cypress
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> proceeded hastily afoot
<lb/>Toward Manizha’s tent and entered it,
<note n="298.1"><q>La réponse de Menijeh fit du coeur et de l'oreille de Bijen un palais</q> (Mohl).</note>
<pb n="299"/>
<lb/>In favour like a stately cypress-tree,
<lb/>Girt with a golden girdle round his loins.
<lb/>Manjizha came and clasped him to her breast,
<lb/>Unloosed the royal girdle from his waist,
<lb/>Asked of his journey, equipage, and business,
<lb/>And said: <q> Who came with thee to fight the boars ?
<lb/>Why trouble with a mace, O comely one,
<lb/>Who hast a shape like this, such mien and bearing?</q></p>
<p><lb/>They bathed his feet in musk and pure rose-water,
<lb/>Then hasted to set meat, they spread the board
<lb/>With various viands in profuse abundance,
<lb/>And held high revelry with wine and harp,
<lb/>Excluding every stranger from the tent.
<lb/>The hanamaids standing in attendance there
<lb/>Played on the lyre and lute. The ground resembled
<lb/>The colours of a peacock with brocade
<lb/>All dappled with dinars like leopards' backs,
<lb/>While all the tent-enclosure was adorned
<lb/>With musk and jewels, ambergris and gold.
<lb/>Old wine in crystal cups gave to <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>New strength, but, when three days and nights had passed
<lb/>In pleasure, sleep and drink prevailed at last.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<head>How Manizha carried of <persName>Bizhan</persName> to her Palace</head>
<p><lb/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1079"/>
<lb/>Manizha, when her time for going home
<lb/>Arrived, still longed to gaze upon <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>And, since his face was gloomy, called her hanamaids,
<lb/>And bade them mingle with a grateful draught
<lb/>A drug that maketh senseless. This they gave him,
<lb/>And he, bemused already, swallowed it;
<lb/>His head sank down and he was lost to sense.
<lb/>She made a litter to transport the sleeper,
<pb n="300"/>
<lb/>A couch for him on one side, on the other
<lb/>An easy seat for her. She sprinkled camphor
<lb/>Upon his couch, and with rose-water drenched
<lb/>The sandal-wood.
<lb/>On coming near the city
<lb/>She veiled the sleeper in a woman’s wrapper,
<lb/>And, entering the palace privily
<lb/>By night, preserved her secret. She prepared
<lb/>A chamber and, impatient for <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>To wake, poured in his ear a rousing potion
<lb/>To bring his senses back. He woke and found
<lb/>That jasmine-bosomed beauty in his arms,
<lb/>His head and hers both resting on a pillow,
<lb/>And in the palace of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> !
<lb/>Distracted with himself he turned for refuge
<lb/>To God from <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> and thus exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>As for myself there will be no escaping,
<lb/>O God Almighty! hence. But oh! that Thou
<lb/>Wouldst execute my vengeance on <persName>Gurgin</persName>,
<lb/>And hear the pains and malisons that I
<lb/>Invoke on him! He led me into this,
<lb/>Reciting over me a thousand spells.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Manizha said to him: <q> Be of good cheer,
<lb/>And treat all save the present as mere wind.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1080"/>
<lb/>Adventures of all kinds occur to men,
<lb/>And feast and fight by turn.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They banqueted ;
<lb/>Before them was the gibbet or espousal :
<lb/>They called the rose-cheeked damsels from their bowers,
<lb/>And decked them in brocade of <placeName>Chin</placeName>; forthwith
<lb/>These girls with fairy faces took the harp,
<lb/>And fleeted day and night in merriment.
<lb/>Anon the chamberlain got wind thereof,
<lb/>And, since one acting on an idle rumour
<lb/>Will shake the fruit down from the tree of bale,
<lb/>He took upon him to investigate,
<pb n="301"/>
<lb/>Inquiring who the man was, from what country,
<lb/>And what he sought in coming to <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>So learned the truth and, fearing for his life,
<lb/>Went, as the only way to save himself,
<lb/>Before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> and said to him :—
<lb/><q>Thy daughter hath a lover from <placeName>Iran</placeName>!</q></p>
<p><lb/>The monarch called on God, and thou hadst said :—
<lb/><q>He trembled like the willow in a blast.</q>
<lb/>Then from the lashes of his eyes he wiped
<lb/>The tears of blood and raged, and spake this saw :—
<lb/><q>One with a daughter in his house to guard
<lb/>May have a crown indeed but is ill-starred.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He was confounded at Manizha’s deed,
<lb/>Called to him princely Kurakhan and said :—
<lb/><q>Advise me in the, matter of this wanton.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then Kurdkhan: <q>Examine with more care :
<lb/>If so it be there is no more to say,
<lb/>But hearing is not seeing.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Instantly
<lb/>The monarch looked at <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> and said :—
<lb/><q>What we have borne and still bear from <placeName>Iran</placeName>!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1081"/>
<lb/>And why doth fortune link in one ill chain
<lb/><rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> troubles and an evil child ?
<lb/>Go take with thee some prudent cavaliers,
<lb/>Keep watch upon the palace—roof and gates—
<lb/>Look well, and any man whom thou shalt see

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<head>How <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> brought <persName>Bizhan</persName> before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>As <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> approached the gate the sound
<lb/>Of feast and revelry was heard within,
<lb/>The music of the rebeck and the harp
<lb/>Rose from the palace of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<pb n="302"/>
<lb/>The cavaliers seized on the roof and gates,
<lb/>And occupied the outlets everywhere.
<lb/>When <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> found that the palace-portal
<lb/>Was fastened, and heard revels going on,
<lb/>He broke down all obstructions, rushed within,
<lb/>And sought the chamber where the stranger was.
<lb/>Now when he reached the door and saw <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>His blood boiled up with rage, for in that chamber
<lb/>There were three hundred hanamaids busied all
<lb/>With harp and wine and singing, and among them,
<lb/>With red wine at his lips and making merry,
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>! Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> cried out in anguish :—
<lb/><q>O reckless and abandoned profligate!
<lb/>Now art thou in the savage Lion’s clutch.
<lb/>How wilt thou ’scape with life?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> writhed, thinking :—
<lb/><q>How can I fight unarmed, without Shabrang,
<lb/>Or aught to ride? Luck, sure, hath gone to-day!
<lb/>Where now is <persName>Giv</persName> son of <persName>Gudarz</persName>, that I
<lb/>Must throw away my life? I see no helper,
<lb/>But God.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He always carried in his boot
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1082"/>
<lb/>A blue-steel dagger: this he drew and holding
<lb/>The door exclaimed: <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName> am I and sprung
<lb/>From that high chief of paladins and nobles,
<lb/><persName>Kishwad</persName>. None e'er shall break my skin unless
<lb/>His body is aweary of its head,
<lb/>And though 'twere Doomsday none should see my back.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He cried to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>: <q>Ill fortune thus
<lb/>Hath dealt with me. Thou knowest my forefathers,
<lb/>My monarch, and my rank among the chiefs ;
<lb/>If ye will fight I am prepared to bathe
<lb/>My hands in blood in battle, and behead
<lb/>Full many a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> chief; if thou wilt bear me
<lb/>Before the king I will explain. Do thou
<pb n="303"/>
<lb/>Ask him to spare my life, and make all end
<lb/>In happiness.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, perceiving
<lb/>The resolution, the dexterity,
<lb/>And readiness to fight shown by <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>Confirmed a covenant with him by oaths,
<lb/>And courteously advised him, thus obtaining
<lb/>The dagger from him by that covenant,
<lb/>And making him a prisoner by smooth words;
<lb/>Then bound him cheetah-like from head to foot.
<lb/>With fortune gone will prowess aught avail ?
<lb/>Thus is it with yon hump-backed sky above,
<lb/>Thou'lt feel its harshness when it looketh love.
<lb/>They carried him with sallow cheeks and eyes
<lb/>Fulfilled with tears before <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.
<lb/>The hero, when he came with pinioned arms
<lb/>And bare of head before the sovereign,
<lb/>Did reverence and said: <q> Vouchsafe, O king!
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1083"/>
<lb/>To seek the truth. I came not to this court
<lb/>By any wish of mine; none is to blame.
<lb/>I left <placeName>Iran</placeName> to fight against wild boars,
<lb/>And chanced on this <rs type="ethnic">Turanian</rs> festival.
<lb/>I sent my kindred and my retinue
<lb/>To seek a falcon that had gone astray,
<lb/>And went to sleep beneath a cypress-tree,
<lb/>So that its shade might shield me from the sun.
<lb/>A fairy came. She spread her wings and took me,
<lb/>Still sleeping, in her arms. She left my charger,
<lb/>And bore me where the escort of thy daughter
<lb/>With troops of cavaliers and many litters
<lb/>Passed by upon the plain. Then there appeared
<lb/>Hemmed in by horse a <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> parasol,
<lb/>And brand-new litter canopied with silk ;
<lb/>Within a lovely Idol slept ; her crown
<lb/>Was lying on her pillow. Suddenly
<lb/>The fairy called on Abriman, and, rushing
<pb n="304"/>
<lb/>Like wind among the horsemen, set me down
<lb/>Inside the litter, and recited charms
<lb/>Above the charmer there, that I might sleep
<lb/>Until I reached the palace of the king ;
<lb/>So I was not to blame, nor hath Manizha
<lb/>Been smirched by what hath passed. Assuredly
<lb/>That fay had marred my fortune by her spells.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> replied : <q>Thine evil day
<lb/>Hath come apace. Departing from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>Thou soughtest fight and fame with mace and lasso ;
<lb/>Now with hands bound thou tellest women’s dreams,
<lb/>Like one bemused, and triest lies upon me
<lb/>To save thy life.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1084"/>
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> replied: <q>O king!
<lb/>Hear what I say to thee and be advised.
<lb/>Boars with their tusks and lions with their claws
<lb/>Are alway fit for fighting ; so are heroes
<lb/>That have their scimitars and bows and arrows;
<lb/>But how when one is naked with bound hands,
<lb/>The other in a panoply of steel ?
<lb/>How can a lion pounce without sharp claws
<lb/>However fierce? If now the king would see
<lb/>My prowess shown to all, let him provide
<lb/>A horse and massive mace for me, and make
<lb/>Choice of a thousand chieftains from the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>;
<lb/>Then hold me not a man if I leave one
<lb/>Alive of all the thousand on the field.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The king regarded him with angry looks
<lb/>At this, then turned to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>, and said :—
<lb/><q>Dost thou not see that this fell <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>
<lb/>Is meditating further ills for me,
<lb/>And not contented with the evil done
<lb/>Would fight as well? Take him bound hand and foot,
<lb/>Just as he is, and rid the world of him.
<lb/>Command to set a gibbet in the road
<lb/>Before the gate, there hang the wretch alive,
<pb n="305"/>
<lb/>And never speak of him to me again,
<lb/>So that no native of <placeName>Iran</placeName> may dare
<lb/>Henceforth to cast an eye upon <placeName>Turan</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They dragged him, stricken to the heart with anguish,
<lb/>His eyes a-stream, forth from <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>And, when <persName>Bizhan</persName> the wretched reached the door,
<lb/>His feet stuck in the mire made by his tears.
<lb/>He said: <q>If God Almighty hath decreed
<lb/>That I must die in miserable plight
<lb/>I do not fear the dying or the gibbet ;
<lb/>My smart is for the warriors of <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1085"/>
<lb/>And royal fathers' blame when I am dead.
<lb/>Alas! mine adversaries will exult,
<lb/>Their lust will all be satistied upon me.
<lb/>Alas! the king of kings! the looks of <persName>Giv</persName>!
<lb/>Alas! thus to be parted from the brave!
<lb/>Go, breezes! to the country of <placeName>Iran</placeName>, .
<lb/>And bear my message to the well-loved <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.
<lb/>Tell him : <q><persName>Bizhan</persName> is in an evil case;
<lb/>His body is beneath the Lion’s claws.</q>
<lb/>Say from me to <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName> :—
<lb/><q>My glory hath departed through <persName>Gurgin</persName> :
<lb/>He cast me into evil so that now

<p><lb/>He galloped palace-ward, approached the king
<lb/>In humble attitude with folded arms,

<p><lb/>As he threw water on the raging fire
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> replied: <q> Dost thou not know

<lb/>Both here and in <placeName>Iran</placeName>? Dost thou not see
<lb/>How mine abandoned daughter hath heaped shame

<lb/>For this disgrace all lands and mine own troops
<lb/>Will ever make my court their laughing-stock ;
<lb/>If he shall live all men will wag their tongues
<lb/>At me, I shall be wretched and despised,
<lb/>And ever from mine eyes shed tears of gall.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> did reverence ofttimes and replied :—
<lb/><q>O monarch of good fortune and just speech !
<lb/>'Tis as the king hath said. His only object
<lb/>Is his good name. But let my lord consider
<lb/>The prudent counsel that I otter him.
<lb/>Let us confine <persName>Bizhan</persName> with heavy chains,
<lb/>Such that he would prefer death on the gibbet ;
<lb/>'Twill be a warning to the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>,
<lb/>Who will not strive to injure us hereafter,
<lb/>For no one readeth on the muster-roll
<lb/>The names of captives in thy prison-house.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The monarch acted as <persName>Piran</persName> advised,
<lb/>Perceiving that his heart and tongue agreed.
<lb/>Good ministers with their good counsellings
<lb/>Illume the <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> divine and throne of kings.

<lb/><q>Prepare a gloomy pit and weighty bonds,
<lb/>Secure with chains <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s hands to a yoke
<lb/>Bridge-like, as Rumans do, from head to foot
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1089"/>
<lb/>Chain him and make all sure with heavy rivets ;
<lb/>Then throw him in the pit head first—no more
<lb/>Of sun and moon for him! Take elephants,
<lb/>And fetch the boulder of the div <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>,
<lb/>Which God raised from the ocean-depth and cast
<lb/>Upon a wood in <placeName>Chin</placeName>. Thus will I be
<lb/>Avenged upon <persName>Bizhan</persName>. Convey this stone,
<lb/>Which covereth the dungeon of Arzhang,
<lb/>Upon high-crested elephants, and cover
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName>’s, then leave him to go mad with angyish.
<lb/>Take horsemen, sack the palace of that wanton—
<lb/>Manizha, who hath shamed her quality—
<lb/>Deprive her of her fortune, crown, and state,
<lb/>And say to her: <q>Thou wretched and accursed,
<lb/>Who art unworthy of the throne and crown!
<lb/>Thou hast abased wy head among the kings,
<lb/>And cast my diadem upon the dust.</q>
<lb/>Then drag her naked to the pit and say :—
<lb/><q>Behold him whom thou sawest on the throne
<lb/>Here in this pit! Thou art his Spring, console him,
<lb/>And wait upon him in his gloomy cell.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>So <persName>Garsiwaz</persName> departed from the presence.
<lb/>They carried out the monarch’s evil purpose ;
<lb/>They haled the son of <persName>Giv</persName> back from the gallows,
<lb/>And bore him to the pit’s mouth in his bonds,
<lb/>There fettered him from head to foot in iron,
<lb/>His waist with <rs type="ethnic">Ruman</rs> chains, his hands with gyves,
<pb n="310"/>
<lb/>The massive rivetings, and then they flung him

<lb/>While smiths with steel and hammers made secury

<lb/>Dwelt, gave up all her treasury to spoil,
<lb/>And made a fresh disposal of the wealth.
<lb/>Manizha was reduced to naked feet,

<lb/>Her cheeks were like the spring.
<lb/><q>Behold,</q> he said,

<p><lb/>He turned back, and Manizha,

<lb/>Now when a day and night had passed she came

<lb/>When one week passed, and still <persName>Bizhan</persName> returned not,
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> began to search on every side
<lb/>In haste and bathed his face in tears of blood.
<lb/>Repenting of his ill intents he sought
<lb/>The place wherein <persName>Bizhan</persName> had gone astray,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1091"/>

<lb/>Went all about the forest but saw no one,
<lb/>And heard not e'er a twitter from the birds:
<lb/>He sought too in the mead, and all at once
<pb n="311"/>
<lb/>Spied in the distance on the river-bank,
<lb/>With bridle broken and with saddle dragging,
<lb/>With hanging lip and in an angry mood,
<lb/>His comrade’s steed, and knew: <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName> is sped!
<lb/>He will not live to come back to <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>By gibbet or by prison or by bonds
<lb/>Tll hath befallen him from <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Repentant and perplexed he flung his lasso,<ref target="n.311.1"/>
<lb/>And turning led <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s steed from the meadow
<lb/>Back to his tent where he abode one day,
<lb/>Then, sleepless and unresting, sought <placeName>Iran</placeName>.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, on hearing that <persName>Gurgin</persName> had come
<lb/>Without <persName>Bizhan</persName>, would fain have been the first
<lb/>To question him, so told not <persName>Giv</persName>, yet <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>Heard of his brave son’s loss, rushed to the street,
<lb/>Pierced to the heart with anguish and with cheeks
<lb/>All tears, and cried: <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName> returneth not !
<lb/>I wis not why he stayeth in Irman.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He gave command to put the poplar saddle
<lb/>Upon <persName>Kishwad</persName>’s own bay, which he was wont

<lb/>To meet <persName>Gurgin</persName> and ask him where <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>Was, and about the case. <q>Good sooth!</q> he thought,

<lb/>I will behead <persName>Gurgin</persName> or see my son.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> on catching sight of <persName>Giv</persName> dismounted,
<lb/>Ran up to him and, wallowing in the dust
<lb/>With head uncovered and torn cheeks, exclaimed :—
<lb/><q>O thou that art the chosen of the host,
<lb/>Chief of <placeName>Iran</placeName> and captain of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>:
<lb/>Why hast thou come to meet me on my way ?

<lb/>Shall now betide me. All ashamed am 1
<lb/>To look thee in the face; I too am pouring

<lb/>About his life. No harm hath come to him
<lb/>As I will prove to thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName>, when he saw
<lb/>His son’s horse and <persName>Gurgin</persName>, all dust and dazed
<lb/>Like one bemused, thus leading it, and when
<lb/>He heard those words, fell from his steed and swooned.
<lb/>His head was hidden by the dust. He rent
<lb/>The raiment that he wore as paladin,
<lb/>Plucked out his hair, and with a cry of anguish
<lb/>Poured dust upon his head.
<lb/><q>O Thou,</q> he said,
<lb/><q>Who art the Almighty Master of the sky,
<lb/>And hast endowed my heart with sense and love!
<lb/>I hold it good, now that my son is lost,
<lb/>That thou shouldst snap my cord of life and take
<lb/>My spirit to the mansions of the blest :
<lb/>Thou knowest best the anguish of my heart.
<lb/>I had no son but him to soothe ny griefs
<lb/>Or aid me; now ill hap hath severed us,
<lb/>And I am left thus in the <rs type="mythologicalcreature">Dragon</rs>’s maw!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He asked <persName>Gurgin</persName> again: <q> How went it all?
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1093"/>
<lb/>Hath fate filled up his place or did he will
<lb/>To quit thy sight? What ill befell him? Speak!
<lb/>Who flung at him the meshes of the sky ?
<lb/>What div encountered him upon the mead ?

<p><lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Compose thyself and listen. In respect
<lb/>To fighting with the wild boars in the wood,
<lb/>Know, O thou paladin ! and understand,
<lb/>And be for aye the lustre of the throne, a
<pb n="313"/>
<lb/>We went to fight the boars and reached Irman.
<lb/>We saw a wood converted to a waste,
<lb/>With trees cut down and trampled pasturage.
<lb/>It was a haunt of boars, the people melted
<lb/>Because of them! We raised our speurs in fight,
<lb/>And made a mighty shouting in the wood ;
<lb/>Wild boars came charging like so any mountains,
<lb/>Not one by one but everywhere in herds.
<lb/>We battled like two lions, and day failed
<lb/>Before our hearts were satiate of strife.
<lb/>We threw their elephantine carcases
<lb/>In heaps and prized their teeth out. Thence we set
<lb/>Our faces toward <placeName>Iran</placeName> and merrily
<lb/>Went after game. An onager was started,
<lb/>And none will see a goodlier sight. Its coat
<lb/>Was like Gulgun’s, the charger of <persName>Gudarz</persName> ;
<lb/>Its face was like Farhad’s grey Shabahang,
<lb/>With limbs like the <rs type="title">Simurgh</rs>’s, and hoofs like steel.
<lb/>'Twas like <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s Shabrang in head and ear
<lb/>And tail, its neck was lion-like, its speed
<lb/>Like wind. Thou wouldst have said: <q> Its sire is
<lb/><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1094"/>
<lb/>Like some tall elephant it charged <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>Who flung his lasso o'er its head. To fling
<lb/>Was one with to be borne away! Off rushed
<lb/>The onager! <persName>Bizhan</persName> sped after it,
<lb/>And through the beast’s pace and the horseman’s dust
<lb/>A reek arose, the earth heaved like the sea,
<lb/>The lassoer and onager both vanished.
<lb/>My steed was weary, so I ran o'er hill
<lb/>And plain, but found no traces of <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>Except this steed whose saddle dragged behind.
<lb/>My heart burned at his plight: <q> How will he fare
<lb/>In his contention with the onager?</q>
<lb/>I tarried long upon the pasture, searching
<pb n="314"/>
<lb/>On all sides for him, and have come back hopeless,
<lb/>For that fierce onazer was the White <rs type="divinity">Div</rs>!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Shrewd <persName>Giv</persName>, on hearing, deemed: <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName> is sped!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He marked <persName>Gurgin</persName>’s confused account, those eyes
<lb/>That could not look him in the face, those cheeks
<lb/>Grown wan with terror of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, that body
<lb/>A-tremble, and that conscience-stricken héart,
<lb/>And ascertaining that his son was lost,
<lb/>And that the whole account was fraudulent,
<lb/>Was moved by Ahriinan to lay <persName>Gurgin</persName>
<lb/>Dead on the road in vengeance for <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>The well-beloved, although disgrace might follow.
<lb/>Albeit on reflection he perceived
<lb/>That this would leave the matter dark, and said :—
<lb/><q>What shall I gain by slaying him save pleasing
<lb/>Malignant <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>? How will it aid
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> to slay <persName>Gurgin</persName>? We must employ
<lb/>Another means ; revenge is no great task ;
<lb/>He is no wall to stop my lance’s point ;
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1095"/>
<lb/>So let us tarry till his guilt is clear
<lb/>Before the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He cried out at <persName>Gurgin</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Thou wicked and injurious <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs> !
<lb/>Thou hast deprived me of my Sun and Moon—
<lb/>The choicest of the horsemen and my <rs type="role">Shah</rs>—
<lb/>And set me searching all the world for aid.
<lb/>Where through thy practice, guile, and lies shall I
<lb/>Henceforward find contentment, rest, and sleep ?
<lb/>I will not suffer thee to go at large
<lb/>Until I have an audience with the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> ;

<lb/><q>For ever fleet the world in joy, O king!
<lb/>Thou blesséd, well-starred monarch ! seest thou not
<lb/>What hath befallen me? I had one son—
<lb/>A youth who was my care both night and day.
<lb/>I wept for fear of danger to him, burned
<lb/>For fear of losing him ; and now, O <rs type="role">Shah</rs>!
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> hath come back with an idle tongue,
<lb/>With guilty soul, and evil news of him—
<lb/>My stainless and illustrious minister.
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> hath brought a steed in disarray,

<lb/>If now my lord will carefully consider

<lb/>The man that put this dust upon my head.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> was troubled at <persName>Giv</persName>’s grief, assumed
<lb/>The crown in anger, sat upon the throne
<lb/>With pallid cheeks in sorrow for <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1096"/>
<lb/>And said to <persName>Giv</persName>: <q> What is <persName>Gurgin</persName>’s account ?
<lb/>Where saith he that he left his upright comrade ?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> told the tale about his gallant son
<lb/>As given by <persName>Gurgin</persName>. Then said <persName>Khusrau</persName> :—
<lb/><q>Brood not nor fret; <persName>Bizhan</persName> is safe; be easy
<lb/>And hopeful touching that lost son of thine,
<lb/>For I but now heard from the archimages—
<lb/>The men of wisdom shrewd of heart and famous—
<lb/>That I shall lead the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> cavaliers
<lb/>Against <placeName>Turan</placeName> anon to seek revenge

<lb/>Destroy that land. <persName>Bizhan</persName> will take the field
<lb/>And fight like <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>. Depart in peace ;
<lb/>Good sooth, I greatly long for him myself.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So <persName>Giv</persName> withdrew in tears, pale and distraught.
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName>, on coming to the palace-gate,
<lb/>Found it deserted; all the paladins
<lb/>Had gone with <persName>Giv</persName> lamenting for <persName>Bizhan</persName>.
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName>, his wicked soul fulfilled with shame,
<lb/>Went in to audience. Having reached <persName>Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>He kissed the ground and offered reverence,
<lb/>Then laid the boars' tusks hard as diamonds
<lb/>Before the throne and did obeisance, saying :—
<lb/><q>May <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> be all victorious,
<lb/>His life like New Year’s Day, and may the heads
<lb/>Of all thy foes be severed by the shears,
<lb/>E'er as the heads of these wild boars.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>Gazed on the tusks and asked: <q>How went. the journey ?
<lb/>Where did <persName>Bizhan</persName> part company? What evil

<lb/>That idly blabbed and guilty soul. His cheeks
<lb/>Were pale, he shook in terror of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>And babbled much and incoherently
<lb/>Of forest, onager, and pasturage.
<lb/>Now, when his words accorded not, <persName>Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>Perceiving him malicious and confused,
<lb/>Was wroth and drave him out, upbraiding him, ,
<lb/>And saying: <q>Hast thou heard not <persName>Zal</persName>’s old saw :—
<lb/><q>To meet the offspring of <persName>Gudarz</persName> in strife

<p><lb/>He had <persName>Gurgin</persName>’s feet fettered presently,

<lb/>But, if I hear not soon, still keep thy wits
<lb/>And wait for <rs type="month">Farwardin</rs>, until the sun—

<lb/>When roses glad the garden, breezes strew

<lb/>Then shall my pious prayers rise to <rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs>—

<head>How <persName>Giv</persName> bore the Letter of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> to <persName>Rustam</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> took the letter when the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> had sealed it,
<lb/>Did reverence and, departing to his house,
<lb/>Prepared to take his journey to <placeName>Sistan</placeName>.
<lb/>He mounted all the horsemen of his kin,
<lb/>And, having first commended him to God,
<lb/>Departed through the desert to the Hirmund,
<lb/>As one that rideth post, or like the game
<lb/>That he put up, perforining two days' journey
<lb/>In one. With wounded hearts and eager steps
<lb/>The party faced the deserts and the heights.
<lb/>Now when the watchman saw <persName>Giv</persName> from the look-out
<lb/>He passed the word on to <placeName>Zabulistan</placeName> :—
<lb/><q>A cavalier with mounted troops hath reached
<lb/>The Hirmund; a standard fluttereth behind him ;
<lb/>A falchion of <placeName>Kabul</placeName> is in his hand.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Zal</persName> heard the watchman’s shout and bade his steed
<lb/>Be bridled, then pricked forth to meet the comers,
<lb/>Who haply might prove foes, but when he saw
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>’s withered face he was astound and hasted,
<lb/>Supposing: <q>Something hath befallen the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>Since <persName>Giv</persName> hath been sent hither from <placeName>Iran</placeName>!</q></p>
<pb n="322"/>
<p><lb/>When near at hand the paladin and escort
<lb/>Drew up across the road and greeted <persName>Zal</persName>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1103"/>
<lb/>Who asked about the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs> and the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>The chieftains and <rs type="ethnic">Turanians</rs>. <persName>Giv</persName> then gave
<lb/>To <persName>Zal</persName> the greetings of the great—the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>'s
<lb/>And high-born warriors'—and told his anguish
<lb/>For his lost son: <q>Thou seest me wan, mine insteps
<lb/>All dappled leopard-like with tears of blood !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then asked where <persName>Rustam</persName> was, and <persName>Zal</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>He will return from hunting onager
<lb/>At sunset.</q>
<lb/><q>Twill go,</q> <persName>Giv</persName> said, <q>and see him ;
<lb/>I have a letter for him from <persName>Khusrau</persName>.</q>
<lb/><q>Go not,</q> <persName>Zal</persName> answered, <q> he will come anon,
<lb/>So till he cometh tarry in the house,
<lb/>And pass one day with us in happiness.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Reflecting on the case they reached <persName>Zal</persName>’s palace,
<lb/>And even as <persName>Giv</persName> entered <persName>Rustam</persName> came.
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> went to meet him and, on drawing nigh,
<lb/>Dismounted from his horse and did obeisance.
<lb/>His heart was yearning and he wept. When <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Saw <persName>Giv</persName> heart-stricken and in tears he thought :—
<q>fran then and the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>—our age’s Moon—
<lb/>Have perished !</q></p>
<p><lb/>Lighting and embracing <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>He asked about the wearer of the crown—
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName>—about <persName>Gudarz</persName>, <persName>Tus</persName>, <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/>And all the warriors both great and small—
<lb/><persName>Shapur</persName>, <persName>Ruhham</persName>, <persName>Bizhan</persName>, Farhad, <persName>Gurgin</persName>,
<lb/>And every one. At mention of <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> uttered an involuntary cry,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1104"/>

<lb/>And said to <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>O thou worshipful,
<lb/>The choicest of the princes of the earth !
<lb/>Joy hath returned to me at sight of thee,
<lb/>And through thy kindly greetings and thy words.
<lb/>All those whom thou hast named are well and send
<pb n="323"/>
<lb/>Thee salutation, peace, and messages,
<lb/>Except <persName>Bizhan</persName>, O champion of the mighty!
<lb/>Who is reported fettered in a dungeon.
<lb/>Now seest thou not what stroke of evil fortune
<lb/>Hath fallen full upon my hoary head ?
<lb/>I had but one son in the world, and he
<lb/>Was both a son and upright minister,
<lb/>And I have lost him! None e'er saw our race
<lb/>In such affliction! Ever since have I
<lb/>Been in the saddle, as thou seest me,
<lb/>And speeding like the bright sun, night and day,
<lb/>Just like the mad, to find some trace of him!
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> hath in his world-reflecting cup... .
<lb/>He stood before the Maker, much imploring
<lb/>And praising on the royal feast—the <rs type="divinity">Urmuzd</rs>
<lb/>Of <rs type="month">Farwardin</rs>—then left the Fane of Fire,
<lb/>Went to his throne, girt up his loins, assumed
<lb/>The crown, and set the shining cup before him.
<lb/>He searched therein past measure for <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>And indicated him as in <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>In heavy fetters and disastrous plight,
<lb/>And, having thus revealed him by the cup,
<lb/>Sent me to thee in haste. I come in hope,
<lb/>Although my cheeks are pale and dim mine eyes,
<lb/>Because I look to thee alone for aid,
<lb/>Who girdest up thy loins to succour all.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1105"/>
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> spake, the lashes of his eyes were charged
<lb/>With tears of gall, and from his heart he heaved
<lb/>A chilling sigh. When he had given the letter
<lb/>To <persName>Rustam</persName> he narrated what <persName>Gurgin</persName>
<lb/>Had done, then bitterly bewailed <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>And poured down tears of blood upon his breast ;
<lb/>For he and <persName>Rustam</persName> had been long akin,
<lb/>That chieftain’s daughter was the wife of <persName>Giv</persName>,
<lb/>While <persName>Rustam</persName> had <persName>Giv</persName>’s sister for his spouse,
<lb/>And gallant Faramarz by that brave dame.
<pb n="324"/>
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> withal, that hero eminent
<lb/>In every company, had for his mother
<lb/>The daughter of the elephantine <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Who said to <persName>Giv</persName>: <q> Be not concerned hereat,
<lb/>Because I will not take from <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> the saddle
<lb/>Till I have clasped <persName>Bizhan</persName>’s hand in mine own,
<lb/>And have demolished all his bonds and prison.
<lb/>By God’s strength, since the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> requireth it,

<p>
<lb/>Thence they departed to the hall of <persName>Rustam</persName>,

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> had perused the monarch’s letter
<lb/>He was o'erwhelmed at what <persName>Khusrau</persName> had said,
<lb/>And all the praises that the worldlord <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>Gave to his famous captain of the host.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> said to <persName>Giv</persName>: <q>I will dispatch,
<lb/>And ready me to go as he commandeth.
<lb/>I know how thou hast laboured, thine achievements,
<lb/>And thy concernment in all enterprise.
<lb/>How mighty is thine influence with me,
<lb/>Who hast wooed war on every battlefield,
<lb/>Alike in the revenge for <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>And in the war against <placeName>Mazandaran</placeName> !
<lb/>Thou hast borne travail too in coming hither,
<lb/>And faring by a route so arduous.
<lb/>I joy exceedingly to look upon thee
<lb/>Although I am concerned about <persName>Bizhan</persName>.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1106"/>
<lb/>I cannot bear to see thee in such grief,
<lb/>And fortune-stricken. As the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> commandeth
<lb/>In this his letter I will take the road,
<lb/>And also out of my concern for thee
<pb n="325"/>
<lb/>Will undertake the matter of <persName>Bizhan</persName>,
<lb/>Will do my best and, if All-holy God
<lb/>Shall leave my body and my soul together,
<lb/>I will not grudge <persName>Bizhan</persName> life, troops, and treasure.
<lb/>I gird me in God’s strength and by the fortune
<lb/>Of our victorious worldlord. I will rescue
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> from bondage and from darksome pit,
<lb/>And will re-seat him on the famous dais.
<lb/>Abide with me three days in joy, quaff wine,
<lb/>Be free from care, for no division parteth
<lb/>My house from thine, and thou and I are one
<lb/>In treasure, soul, and body.</q> 
<lb/>At his words
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName> sprang up, kissed his hands and head and feet,
<lb/>Applauded him, and said: <q>O man of name,
<lb/>Endowed with strength and manhood, worth and fortune !
<lb/>Mayst thou have ever thus the heart and strength
<lb/>Of elephants and archimages' prudence.
<lb/>Thou dost partake all excellence, and so
<lb/>Hast cleansed my heart from rust.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> saw
<lb/><persName>Giv</persName>’s heart content, and felt himself assured
<lb/>That all would turn out well, he told his steward :—
<lb/><q>Set out the board and call the chiefs and sages,</q></p>

<lb/>Abode three days and made no haste to leave.

<p>
<lb/>The fourth day they prepared to go, 'twas time;

<lb/>All ready for the journey to <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>While at his gate his noble horsemen gathered,
<lb/>Dight for the road. He came forth, mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>,
<lb/>Girt up his loins, put on a Riman vest,
<lb/>And hung his grandsire’s mace beside the saddle,
<lb/>Intent on feats of arms and strategy.
<lb/><rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> struck the sky above him, but the head
<lb/>Of crown-bestowing <persName>Rustam</persName> topped the sun,
<lb/>They took their loads up, leaving Faramarz
<lb/>Within <placeName>Zabul</placeName>, and <persName>Rustam</persName>, <persName>Giv</persName>, and troops—
<lb/>Picked Zabulis, a hundred thousand strong—
<lb/>Set forth upon the march toward <placeName>Iran</placeName>:
<lb/>All hurried on with vengeance in their hearts.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> reached <placeName>Iran</placeName>, and when the throne
<lb/>Of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> was coming into sight,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1108"/>
<lb/>A sweet breeze wafted to him in its love
<lb/>And gaiety the welcome of the sky.
<lb/>Then <persName>Giv</persName> drew near to <persName>Rustam</persName> saying thus :—
<lb/><q>Tis fit that I go first and tell the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>That matchless <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> hath measured all the road.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Said <persName>Rustam</persName> : <q>Go rejoicing, say to him :—

<p><lb/>When <persName>Giv</persName> approached

<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> demanded: <q> Where was <persName>Rustam</persName> left ?
<lb/>How have ye sped ?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> answered: <q><rs type="role">Shah</rs> renowned !
<lb/>Thy fortune bringeth all things to success.
<lb/>He disobeyed thee not, I found his heart
<lb/>Devoted to thee. When I gave thy letter
<pb n="327"/>
<lb/>He pressed it to his face and eyes, and hitched
<lb/>His reins to mine as should a faithful liege.
<lb/>I have pushed on that I might tell the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>That matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> is upon the road.</q>
<lb/><q>But,</q> said <persName>Khusrau</persName>, <q> where is that Prop of chiefs,

<p><lb/><persName>Giv</persName> replied :—
<lb/><q>Two stages back; I came on first to tell thee.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName> gave orders to the sages,
<lb/>The royal princes, and the mighty men,
<lb/>To go forth with the host to welcome <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Who came obedient to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s command.
<lb/>They told <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, Farhad,
<lb/>And <persName>Tus</persName>—chief of the offspring of <persName>Naudar</persName>.
<lb/>The more part of the warriors and nobles,

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1109"/>
<lb/>And dight themselves to go and meet the guest,
<lb/>According to the usance of <persName>Kaus</persName>.
<lb/>The world was azure-dim with horsemen’s dust,
<lb/>The standards fluttered, and the chargers neighed.
<lb/>When they drew near to <persName>Rustam</persName> they dismounted
<lb/>And did obeisance. That chief paladin,
<lb/>Alighting, greeted all the veterans,
<lb/>And asked about the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> and how things went
<lb/>Beneath resplendent sun and shining moon;
<lb/>Then swiftly as the bright <rs type="divinity">Azargashasp</rs>
<lb/>The warriors and <persName>Rustam</persName> all remounted.
<lb/>He came before that <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, who loved his lieges,
<lb/>With measured tread and offered reverence,
<lb/>For 'twas his duty to revere and love,
<lb/>Then raised his head, gave praise, and said: <q>Be thou

<lb/>And throne beneath a bower that scattered roses,
<lb/>And laid down court-brocade o'er all the pleasance,
<lb/>Which shone as 'twere alamp. They had a tree
<lb/>Set up above the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s throne to enshadow

<lb/>The branches were of gold and jewelry,
<lb/>The jewels manifold and clustering,
<lb/>The leaves of emeralds and carnelians,
<lb/>And fruit hung down, like earrings, from the boughs.
<lb/>The fruits were golden oranges and quinces :
<lb/>All hollow and all perforate like reeds,
<lb/>And charged with musk worked up with wine that when

<lb/>All the cup-bearers wearing coronets

<lb/>Thou art a shield betwixt <placeName>Iran</placeName> and ill

<lb/>Stand in my presence with their loins girt up,
<lb/>And always are my guides to what is good,
<lb/>While, more than all, <persName>Giv</persName> shielded me from harm.
<lb/>Such grief ne'er came before upon this house

<lb/>Be greed and wrath and need afar from thee,

<lb/>Thou art <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, lord, and chief above all kings,

<lb/>The throne, the bright sun, and the shining moon

<lb/>My mother gave me birth to toil for thee ;

<lb/>I am obedient to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s commands,
<lb/>And go where thou shalt bid. By royal <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs>,
<lb/>And by my massive mace, I plucked the heart

<lb/>The anguish shown and message sent perturbed him ;
<lb/>He grieved at that request so fondly urged,
<pb n="332"/>
<lb/>And bade the envoy: <q>Go, return, and say :—
<lb/><q>Insensate wretch! hast heard not what the leopard
<lb/>Said by the deep stream to the crocodile :—
<lb/><q>If passion gain the upper hand of wit,
<lb/>Then nobody will ’scape the clutch of it</q> ?
<lb/>The sage that quelleth passion hath a record
<lb/>As of a noble Lion; thine hath been
<lb/>An ancient fox’s, yet thou didst o'erlook
<lb/>The snare! I should not grant thy frantic wish
<lb/>That I should bring thy name before <persName>Khusrau</persName>,
<lb/>Yet, since I see thee in such straits and all
<lb/>Confounded, I will ask him to forgive thee,
<lb/>And lighten thy dark moon. Then, if <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>By God the Ruler of the world’s command
<lb/>Escape, thou wilt be freed and save thy life
<lb/>From <persName>Giv</persName>’s revenge. Should heaven will otherwise
<lb/>Deem life and person as unworth thy love.
<lb/>First will I go forth on my quest and vengeful
<lb/>In God’s strength at the bidding of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1114"/>
But if I fail that man of prowess <persName>Giv</persName>
<lb/>Will then take wreak on thee for his brave son.</q></q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus passed a night and day, and <persName>Rustam</persName> spake
<lb/>Naught to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, but when upon the morrow
<lb/>The sun displayed its crown and took its seat
<lb/>Upon its silver-sheening ivory throne,
<lb/>Came <persName>Rustam</persName> flying unto <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>
<lb/>To ask a boon of that victorious <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>While speaking of <persName>Gurgin</persName>, his fallen fortune,
<lb/>And wretched plight. The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> said: <q> Chieftain mine!
<lb/>Thou wouldst then break my bonds and break with me,
<lb/>Because I swore by throne, crown, <rs type="heavenlybody">Mars</rs>, and <rs type="heavenlybody">Venus</rs>,
<lb/>And sun and moon: <q><persName>Gurgin</persName> shall see but ill
<lb/>From me unless <persName>Bizhan</persName> be freed from bondage.</q>
<lb/>Excepting this ask of me what thou wilt
<lb/>Of swords and signet-rings, of thrones and crowns.</q>
<pb n="333"/>
<lb/>He answered: <q> Virtuous and famous prince!
<lb/>If he intended harm he suffereth,
<lb/>And is prepared to offer up his life;
<lb/>But if the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> will not forgive him first
<lb/>He will be outcast from the Faith and honour.
<lb/>Whoever turneth from the way of wisdom
<lb/>Will writhe for his ill-doing at the last.
<lb/>Vouchsafe to call to mind <persName>Gurgin</persName>’s exploits,
<lb/>How he hath taken part in every fight,
<lb/>And been a champion with thine ancestors ;
<lb/>If for my sake the <rs type="role">Shah</rs> will pardon him
<lb/>His fortunes may be somewhat brightened yet.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, that <persName>Rustam</persName> might not plead in vain,

<p>
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> asked <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q> When wilt thou depart
<lb/>For this campaign? Demand whate'er thou wilt—
<lb/>Troops, treasure, and companions for the journey.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1115"/>
<lb/>Malevolent <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, I fear me,

<lb/>Anon will turn his heart aside and prompt him
<lb/>To slay our swordsman.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> thus replied :—
<lb/><q>I will achieve this enterprise by stealth,
<lb/>For only craft will loosen such a coil.
<lb/>We must not give occasion for alarm,
<lb/>But set off in the guise of merchantmen,
<lb/>And tarry for a while within <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<lb/>This is a case for drawing in the rein,
<lb/>And not a time for maces, swords, and spear-points.
<lb/>I shall require much silver, gold, and gems;
<pb n="334"/>
<lb/>We start in hope but we shall stay in fear.
<lb/>I shall need garments too and carpetings
<lb/>For giving presents and as merchandise.</q></p>
<p><lb/>On hearing <persName>Rustam</persName>’s words <persName>Khusrau</persName> commanded
<lb/>His treasurer to bring him whatsoever
<lb/>His minister directed from the hoards
<lb/>Laid up of yore. The royal treasurer
<lb/>Undid the purses and bestrewed the throne
<lb/>With jewels and dinars. Came matchless <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Inspected all, and chose whate'er was needed.
<lb/>He took ten camel-burdens of dinars,
<lb/>Five score of other ware; he next commanded
<lb/>The chamberlain: <q>Choose out a thousand horse.
<lb/>Some of the proud and noble lion-men
<lb/>Must also gird themselves—<persName>Gurgin</persName> and Zanga,
<lb/>The son of Shawardn, next <persName>Gustaham</persName>,
<lb/>The Falchion of the brave, and fourth Guraza,
<lb/>The sentinel of warriors, throne, and crown,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1116"/>

<lb/>To lead the host, <persName>Ruhham</persName>, Farhad, two men
<lb/>Of valour, and Ashkash that lion-hero.
<lb/>These seven warriors must make them ready
<lb/>To overlook the escort and the goods.</q></p>
<p><lb/>These, every one in his allotted part,

<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> went to the City of <placeName>Khutan</placeName> to <persName>Piran</persName></head>
<p>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> bade those chieftains, those mace- wielders,
<lb/>Those dealers out of death, to gird themselves
<lb/>At dawn what time the officer on duty
<lb/>Came to the gate. At daybreak, when the cock crew,
<lb/>They bound the drums upon the elephants,
<lb/>While <persName>Rustam</persName> came forth like a lofty cypress,
<pb n="335"/>
<lb/>Mace in his hand and lasso on his saddle.
<lb/>He left the royal portal with his troops,
<lb/>And called down blessings on the land. The chiefs
<lb/>Went first, the soldiers followed, and all took
<lb/>Their lives in hand, their guides were spears and arrows,
<lb/>And every hand had been imbrued in blood.
<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> reached the marches of <placeName>Turan</placeName>
<lb/>He picked out all the chiefs, then bade the troops :—
<lb/><q>Abide here cheerfully, move not unless
<lb/>All-holy God deprive me of my life,
<lb/>Be dight for battle and prepared for bloodshed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus in those marches of <placeName>Iran</placeName> he left them,
<lb/>And went, he and the chiefs, towards <placeName>Turan</placeName>.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1117"/>
<lb/>He doffed his mail and donned a merchant’s dress,
<lb/>The warriors undid their silver girdles,
<lb/>And he arrayed them all in woollen robes.
<lb/>They fared toward <placeName>Turan</placeName>—a caravan
<lb/>All scent and colour. There were eight fine steeds,
<lb/>One <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>, the others were the warriors' mounts,
<lb/>Ten camels bearing bales of jewelry,
<lb/>And five score bearing soldiers' uniforms.
<lb/>The waste rang like the horn of <persName>Tahmuras</persName>
<lb/>With bells and shouting. <persName>Rustam</persName> journeyed on
<lb/>Until he reached the city of <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>For there was one in those <rs type="ethnic">Turanian</rs> marches
<lb/>Belonging to that chief, but he himself
<lb/>Was at the chase; his palace was unguarded.
<lb/>Now when he came back from the hunting-field
<lb/>The matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> saw hin on the road,
<lb/>And having covered over with brocade
<lb/>A golden goblet filled with precious stones
<lb/>Gave it and therewithal two splendid steeds,
<lb/>With saddles made of gold adorned with jewels,
<lb/>To the attendants, and preceding them
<lb/>Strode to <persName>Piran</persName>’s throne swiftly, did obeisance,
<pb n="336"/>
<lb/>And said: <q>O prince whose fortune and whose prowess
<lb/>Are famous in <placeName>Iran</placeName> and in <placeName>Turan</placeName>!
<lb/>Thy <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and crown are peerless, for thou art
<lb/>King’s minister and glory of the throne.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName>, so God ordained it, knew not <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>But questioned him and said: <q>Whence art thou?
<lb/>Speak !
<lb/>What man art thou and wherefore hast thou come ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He said: <q>Iam thy subject. God assigned me
<lb/>A cistern in thy city. I have measured
<lb/>A long and grievous journey from <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1118"/>
<lb/>To traffic in <placeName>Turan</placeName>. I sell and buy,
<lb/>And deal in every sort of merchandise.
<lb/>My soul hath good assurance of thy love,
<lb/>Such was the power of hope within my heart !
<lb/>If now the paladin will take me 'neath
<lb/>His wing I will buy cattle and sell jewels.
<lb/>Through thy just dealing none will do me hurt,
<lb/>The cloud-rack of thy love rain gems upon ine.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> offered him before the lords
<lb/>The cup of royal gems, and splendid <rs type="ethnic">Arabs</rs>
<lb/>With coats too sleek to hold the wind-borne dust.
<lb/>This wealth with many a blessing <persName>Rustam</persName> gave,
<lb/>And fairly clinched the matter. When <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>Beheld the jewels in the brilliant cup
<lb/>He praised and welcomed <persName>Rustam</persName>, seating him
<lb/>Upon the turquoise throne, and said: <q> Depart
<lb/>Content and enter with all confidence,
<lb/>For I will lodge thee near me; be at ease
<lb/>About thy goods, thou hast no foeman here.
<lb/>Go fetch thy wares, seek buyers on all sides,
<lb/>Make my son’s house thy home, and be to me
<lb/>As 'twere a kinsman.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> answered thus :—
<lb/><q>I will abide here with my caravan,
<lb/>O paladin! What goods I have are thine,
<pb n="337"/>
<lb/>And 'twill be well with me be where I may,
<lb/>But in that I have jewels of all kinds,
<lb/>And must not lose one, by thy conquering fortune
<lb/>We will remain outside in great content.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Piran</persName> replied: <q>Go then and choose thy place,
<lb/>And I will station guards for thy defence.</q></p>
<p><lb/>So <persName>Rustam</persName> chose a house, appointed it,
<lb/>And filled the warehouse with his goods and packs.
<lb/>News spread: <q>A caravan out of <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>Hath visited the noble paladin,</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1119"/>
<lb/>And buyers everywhere pricked up their ears
<lb/>When tidings reached them of those jewel-merchants.
<lb/>Those that would buy brocade or stuffs or gems
<lb/>Departed toward the court-gate of <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>And when the sun arose the world to grace
<lb/>The warehouse had become a market-place.</p></div>

<p>
<lb/>Manizha heard and hurried to the city ;
<lb/>Bare-headed, weeping bitterly, she came—
<lb/>That daughter of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>—to <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>And, wiping from her lashes with her sleeve
<lb/>The tears of blood, blessed, greeted him, and said :—
<lb/><q>Enjoy’st thou life and wealth? God grant that thou
<lb/>Mayst ne'er have reason to repent thy toils.
<lb/>May heaven perform thy will, the evil eye
<lb/>Not harm thee, and since thou hast heart of hope
<lb/>May this thy travail not result in loss.
<lb/>May wisdom ever be thy monitor,
<lb/>And may <placeName>Iran</placeName> be blessed and fortunate.
<lb/>What know’st thou of the warriors of the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>,
<lb/>Of <persName>Giv</persName>, Giidarz, and the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> host ?
<lb/>Have tidings of <persName>Bizhan</persName> not reached <placeName>Iran</placeName>?
<pb n="338"/>
<lb/>Will not his supplications aught avail,
<lb/>That such a youth—a scion of <persName>Gudarz</persName>—
<lb/>May be released from irons? His feet are galled
<lb/>With fetters and his hands with blacksmiths' rivets!
<lb/>He hath been dragged in chains, made fast in bonds!
<lb/>Poor wretch ! his clothes are soaked in his own blood !
<lb/>I get no rest myself for I must beg.
<lb/>His lamentations fill mine eyes with tears.</q>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1120"/>
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> in alarm roared out at her,
<lb/>And drave her forth. <q>Be off!</q> hecried, <q>I know not
<lb/><persName>Khusrau</persName> or this young chief. I have no tidings
<lb/>About <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName>, and thou hast chattered
<lb/>My wits away.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Manizha looked at <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>Wept bitterly, and showered tears of blood
<lb/>Upon her bosom in her wretchedness.
<lb/>She said to him: <q>O chieftain full of wisdom !
<lb/>Such heartless words as these become thee not.
<lb/>Drive me not from thee if thou wilt not talk,
<lb/>For I am stricken to the heart with anguish.
<lb/>Is it indeed the custom of <placeName>Iran</placeName>
<lb/>To tell the poor no news ?</q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered thus :—
<lb/><q>What ailed thee, woman, then? Did <rs type="divinity">Ahriman</rs>
<lb/>Give thee a foretaste of the Day of Doom?
<lb/>Thou didst prevent my trafficking, and therefore
<lb/>I rated thee; but do not take to heart
<lb/>My hastiness, my thoughts were on my trade.
<lb/>Besides I have no home within the land
<lb/>Of <persName>Kai Khusrau</persName>, I know naught of <persName>Gudarz</persName>
<lb/>And <persName>Giv</persName>, and ne'er have travelled in those marches.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He bade to give the mendicant such food
<lb/>As was at hand, then questioned her at large :—
<lb/><q>Why is't that fortune is so dark with thee ?
<lb/>Why ask about the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>’s throne and <placeName>Iran</placeName>?
<lb/>Why look upon the road that leadeth thither?</q>
<pb n="339"/>
<lb/>She said to him: <q> Why ask about my case,
<lb/>My travail, and my trouble? From the mouth
<lb/>Of yonder pit have I with aching heart
<lb/>Made haste to thee, O noble man! to ask
<lb/>The latest news of <persName>Giv</persName> and of <persName>Gudarz</persName>,
<lb/>The warriors, and thou didst shout at me
<lb/>As fighters shout! Fear’st not the Judge of all?
<lb/>The daughter of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> am I—
<lb/>Manizha. Never had the sun beheld
<lb/>My form unveiled, but now with eyes all blood,
<lb/>And heart all pain, with sallow cheeks I roam
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1121"/>
<lb/>From door to door and gather barley bread,
<lb/>So hath God willed! Can fortune be more wretched ?
<lb/>Oh! that Almighty God would end it for me,
<lb/>Because resourceless and in yon deep pit
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> beholdeth neither night nor day,
<lb/>Nor sun nor moon, but yoked and riveted
<lb/>In heavy bonds is praying God for death.
<lb/>Hence are my griefs redoubled, hence these tears.
<lb/>Thou mayst, if thou art journeying to <placeName>Iran</placeName>,
<lb/>Hear of <persName>Gudarz</persName> son of <persName>Kishwad</persName>, or see
<lb/>About the court-gate <persName>Giv</persName> or gallant <persName>Rustam</persName> ;
<lb/>Then say : <q> <persName>Bizhan</persName> is in a pit and, save

<lb/>If thou wouldst look upon him tarry not,
<lb/>For iron is below him, stone above.</q> </q></p>
<p><lb/>Thus <persName>Rustam</persName> answered her: <q>O fair of face!
<lb/>Why rain these tears of love? Why not invite
<lb/>Thy nobles' intercession with thy sire ?
<lb/>He may be pitiful, his blood may stir,
<lb/>His liver burn; but for my fear of him
<lb/>I would have furnished thee with countless things.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then said he to the cooks: <q> Bring forth for her

<p><lb/>He bade them fetch a bird hot from the spit,

<lb/>And, as he wrapped it in soft bread,<ref target="n.340.1"/> slipped in,

<lb/>Manizha came back to the pit’s mouth, running,

<lb/>Called to the sun-faced damsel from the pit,
<lb/>And said: <q> Where didst thou get the food, my love!
<lb/>That thou hast speeded thus? How much of toil
<lb/>And hardship hath befallen thee, and all
<lb/>On mine account, my love and succourer!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Manjizha answered: <q> From a caravan.
<lb/>A merchantman—a man possessed of wealth—
<lb/>Came hither from <placeName>Iran</placeName> in search of gain,
<lb/>With merchandise of all kinds great and small—
<lb/>A holy man of <rs type="ethnic">Grace</rs> and understanding,
<lb/>Who bringeth many jewels of all sorts.
<lb/>He is a man of might and open heart,
<lb/>And hath put up a booth before his house;

<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> with hope amid his fears unrolled
<lb/>The good bread, in perplexity began
<lb/>To eat, observed the ring, and read the name,
<lb/>Then burst out laughing in his joy and wonder.
<lb/>It was a turquoise ring with <q><persName>Rustam</persName></q> graven
<note n="340.1">Bread in <placeName>Persia</placeName> usually is made up into flexible loaves about one foot wide, two or three feet long, and half an inch thick.</note>

<lb/>Fine as a hair thereon. <persName>Bizhan</persName> beholding
<lb/>The fruit upon the tree of faithfulness,
<lb/>And wotting that the key to loose his sorrow
<lb/>Had come, laughed out and that right royally,
<lb/>So that the sound was heard outside the pit.
<lb/>Manizha marvelled when she heard him laugh
<lb/>From that dark dungeon fettered as he was,
<lb/>And said: <q>The mad will laugh at their own acts!</q></p>
<p><lb/>She paused in sheer amazement, then she said :—

<lb/><q>O destined to high fortune! why this laughter ?
<lb/>Why laugh, for thou discern’st not night from day ?
<lb/>What is the mystery? Reveal it! Tell me!
<lb/>Doth better fortune show thee countenance ?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> replied to her: <q>I am in hope
<lb/>That fortune will undo this grievous coil.
<lb/>Now if with me thou wilt not break thy faith,
<lb/>And make a covenant with me by oath,
<lb/>I will reveal the matter every whit,

<p><lb/>Manizha hearing this wept bitterly :—

<lb/>I gave <persName>Bizhan</persName> my heart and home and wealth,

<lb/>My father and my kin abandoned me,

<lb/>I did hope in Bfzhan but hope no more.
<lb/>My world is darkened and mine eyes are dim,

<lb/>On mine account, for else he had no need

<p><lb/>When Sol had vanished and dark night had led
<lb/>Its army o'er the mountain-tops what time
<lb/>The world, its features hidden, taketh rest,
<lb/>Manizha went and set a-blaze a fire,
<lb/>That scorched the eye of pitch-black night, and listened
<lb/>To hear the clanging of the kettledrum
<lb/>Which told that <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> the brazen-hoofed had come.</p></div>

<head>How <persName>Rustam</persName> took <persName>Bizhan</persName> out of the Pit</head>
<p><lb/>
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1126"/>
<lb/>Then Rustain buckled on his Riman mail,
<lb/>With prayers for succour and support to Him,
<lb/>Who is the Lord of sun and moon, and said :—
<lb/><q>Oh! may the eyes of evil men be blinded,
<lb/>And may I have the strength to save <persName>Bizhan</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>At his command the warriors girt themselves
<lb/>With girdles of revenge, put on their steeds
<lb/>The poplar saddles, and prepared for combat ;
<lb/>Then matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> led them toward the fire.
<lb/>When he approached the boulder of <rs type="divinity">Akwan</rs>,
<lb/>Approached that pit of sorrow, smart, and anguish,
<lb/><q>Dismount,</q> he told the seven warriors,
<lb/><q>And strive to clear the pit’s mouth of the stone.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They strove in vain and sorely galled their hands.
<pb n="345"/>
<lb/>Now while their sweat ran, for the stone stood still,
<lb/>The lion-chief alighted, hitched his skirt
<lb/>Of mail beneath his belt and, asking strength
<lb/>From God its source, grasped, raised, and hurled the boulder
<lb/>Back to the forest of the land of <placeName>Chin</placeName>:
<lb/>Earth shook thereat. Then asked he of <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>With lamentable cries: <q>How camest thou
<lb/>To such a luckless plight? Thy portion here
<lb/>Was wont to be all sweetness; why hast thou
<lb/>Received then from the world a cup of poison?</q> 
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> replied : <q>How fared the paladin
<lb/>Upon the way? Thy greeting reached mine ear,
<lb/>And this world’s poison was made sweet to me.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1127"/>
<lb/>Such as thou seest is my dwelling-place,
<lb/>Mine earth is iron and my heaven stone,
<lb/>While through exceeding anguish, hardship, sorrow,
<lb/>And toil I have renounced this Wayside Inn.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Said <persName>Rustam</persName>: <q>God had pity on thy lite,
<lb/>And now, O man wise and magnanimous!
<lb/>There is one thing that I desire of thee:
<lb/>Grant pardon to <persName>Gurgin</persName> son of Milad
<lb/>For my sake, putting from thee hate and malice.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He answered: <q>O my friend! how shouldst thou know
<lb/>What conflicts have been mine? And know’st thou not,
<lb/>O noble lion-man! that which <persName>Gurgin</persName>
<lb/>Hath done to me? If I behold him ever
<lb/>My vengeance shall bring Doomsday down on him.</q>
<lb/><q>If thou show’st malice and wilt not attend
<lb/>To what I say,</q> said <persName>Rustam</persName>, <q>I will leave thee
<lb/>Bound in the pit, and mount, and hie me home.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName>’s answer reached the captive’s ear
<lb/>A wail went up from that strait prison-house
<lb/>As he replied: <q>The wretchedest am I
<lb/>Of warriors, of my kindred, and my people!
<pb n="346"/>
<lb/>I must put up to-day too with the wrong—
<lb/>The great wrong—which <persName>Gurgin</persName> hath done to me!
<lb/>Yea I will do so and will be content ;
<lb/>My heart shall rest from taking vengeance on him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> let his lasso down the pit,
<lb/>And drew up thus <persName>Bizhan</persName> with fettered feet,
<lb/>With naked body, with long hair and nails,
<lb/>And wasted by affliction, pain, and want,
<lb/>His form blood-boltered, and his visage wan
<lb/>By reason of those bonds and rusty fetters,
<lb/>Now <persName>Rustam</persName> cried aloud when he beheld
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> with body hidden by the iron,
<lb/>And putting forth his hands he snapped the chains
<lb/>And bonds, and freed <persName>Bizhan</persName> from ring and fetter.
<lb/>They went toward <persName>Rustam</persName>’s house; on one side of him
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> rode, on the other side Manizha.
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1128"/>
<lb/>The youthful pair sat in their sorry plight,
<lb/>And told their story to the paladin.
<lb/>Then <persName>Rustam</persName> bade them bathe the young man’s head,
<lb/>And clothed him in new robes. When afterward
<lb/><persName>Gurgin</persName> approached and, prone upon the dust,
<lb/>Sought to excuse his evil deeds, and writhed
<lb/>For words so ill-advised, <persName>Bizhan</persName> condoned
<lb/>The matter. Then they loaded up the camels,
<lb/>And put the saddles on the steeds, while <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>Assumed his favourite mail and mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>.
<lb/>The warriors drew forth their scimitars
<lb/>And massive maces, sent the baggage on,
<lb/>And dight themselves for strife. Ashkash the shrewd—
<lb/>The army’s Ear—went with the baggage-train.
<lb/>Then matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> bade <persName>Bizhan</persName>: <q> Away,
<lb/>And journey with Manizha and Ashkash,
<lb/>For in my vengeance on <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>To-night I shall not eat, repose, or sleep.
<lb/>Now will I do such exploits at his gate
<lb/>That on the morn his troops shall laugh at him.
<pb n="347"/>
<lb/>Thou hast endured enough with bonds and pit,

<lb/>With bridles on their saddle-bows they drew
<lb/>The sword of vengeance. While all slept within
<lb/>He reached the court-gate of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>,
<lb/>And, breaking with his hands both bolt and bar,
<lb/>Fierce as a lion flung himself inside.
<lb/>In every quarter sounds of tumult rose,
<lb/>Swords glittered, arrows rained, the chieftains' heads
<lb/>Were all struck off, their hands were filled with dust,
<lb/>Their mouths with blood, while <persName>Rustam</persName> in the porch
<lb/>Cried : <q> May sweet sleep distaste thee! For thy bed
<lb/>Thou hadst a throne, <persName>Bizhan</persName> had but a pit.
<lb/>Didst see an iron wall between us? I

<lb/>And 'tis no season this for sleep and couching.
<lb/>I have burst through thy prison, door and bar,
<lb/>Where that huge boulder stood on guard for thee.
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> is free both head and foot from bonds :
<lb/>Let no one thus maltreat a son-in-law!
<lb/>Of fighting and revenge for <persName>Siyawush</persName>,
<lb/>And dust from <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>’s feet upon the plain,
<lb/>Thou hadst enough yet fain wouldst slay <persName>Bizhan</persName>!
<lb/>I know thy wicked heart and drowsy head.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> too cried: <q> Dense and malignant <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> !
<lb/>Bethink thee of yon throne, thy glorious seat,
<lb/>And me withal that stood in chains before thee.
<pb n="348"/>
<lb/>I challenged combat leopard-like, but thou

<lb/>Now see me free upon the plain—a man

<milestone unit="vullers" n="1130"/>
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName> exclaimed: <q> Hath sleep enfettered

<p><lb/>On all sides was the sound of hurried steps,
<lb/>The bloodshed made a river at the gate,
<lb/>And when a soldier of <placeName>Turan</placeName> appeared
<lb/>His place was void forthwith, The <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>Came seeking vengeance, but <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>Escaped by flight. The lord of <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> rode in
<lb/>Upon the carpets of brocade. The warriors
<lb/>Took the fair slaves who caught them by the hand,
<lb/>Took too the noble steeds with poplar saddles,
<lb/>Whose flaps of pard-skin were beset with gems,
<lb/>Then left the royal palace, packed the baggage,
<lb/>And stayed not in <placeName>Turan</placeName> but hastened on
<lb/>To save the booty and avoid mishap.
<lb/>So spent was <persName>Rustam</persName> that he scarce endured
<lb/>His helmet, while the horses and their riders
<lb/>Had no pulse left. He sent to bid the host :—
<lb/><q>Unsheathe your vengeful scimitars; no doubt
<lb/>The earth will be bediinmed by horses' hoofs,
<lb/>Because <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> will gather him
<lb/>A mighty host whose spears will veil the sun.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They marched along, those warlike cavaliers,
<lb/>All ready for the fray, with sharpened lances
<lb/>And reins well gathered in. A scout ascended
<lb/>The look-out and from far surveyed the route
<lb/>Whereby the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> cavaliers would come.
<lb/>Manizha then was sitting in her tent ;
<lb/>Before her were her hanamaids and her guide,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1131"/>
<lb/>And matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> spoke to her this saw :—
<lb/><q>If musk be poured away the scent will stay.</q>

<lb/>Such is the fashion of this Wayside Inn,

<p>
<lb/>When Sol rose o'er the hills the <rs type="ethnic">Turkman</rs> horsemen
<lb/>Prepared to march. The city was astir,
<lb/>And, thou hadst said, a deafening clamour rose.
<lb/>Before the court-gate of <persName>Afrasiyab</persName>
<lb/>The troops formed rank, the great men loosed their loins,
<lb/>And bowed their heads in dust before the king,
<lb/>Exclaiming : <q>Things with us have passed all bounds!
<lb/>What must be done? This business of <persName>Bizhan</persName>
<lb/>Will be a lasting stigma, the <rs type="ethnic">Iranians</rs>
<lb/>Will call us men no more, but women armed.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Thereat <persName>Afrasiyab</persName> raged like a pard,
<lb/>And bade them fight for shame. He bade <persName>Piran</persName>
<lb/>To bind the tymbals on, and thus he said :—
<lb/><q>This flouting from <placeName>Iran</placeName> is over-much !</q></p>
<p><lb/>The brass blared at the court-gate of the king,
<lb/>The troops were all in motion in <placeName>Turan</placeName>,
<lb/>The warriors ranked themselves before the palace,
<lb/>Arose the din of trump and <rs type="ethnic">Indian</rs> bell,
<lb/>And to the frontier from <placeName>Turan</placeName> a host
<lb/>Marched that left earth no surface save the sea.
<lb/>Now when the <rs type="ethnic">Iranian</rs> watchman from the look-out
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1132"/>
<lb/>Saw earth heave ocean-like he came to <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>And said: <q> Make ready, for the world is black
<lb/>With dust of horsemen !</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Rustam</persName> made reply :—
<lb/><q>We fear not, we will strew it on their hands.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He left. Manizha with the baggage, donned
<lb/>His battle-muil, went to a height, observed
<pb n="350"/>
<lb/>The foe, and roared out like a savage lion.
<lb/>That gallant horseman spake a proverb, saying :—
<lb/><q>What doth a fox weigh in a lion’s claws?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then to his valiant warriors he shouted :—
<lb/><q>The wage of war confronteth us to-day.
<lb/>Where are the swords and iron-piercing darts ?
<lb/>Where are the ox-head maces and the spears ?
<lb/>Now is the season to display your prowess,
<lb/>And rank yourselves upon the battlefield.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Anon arose a sound of clarions,
<lb/>While matchless <persName>Rustam</persName> mounted <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs> and led
<lb/>His army plainward from the heights what time
<lb/>The foe was seen approaching.<ref target="n.350.1"/> Both the hosts
<lb/>Deployed upon that broad expanse and formed
<lb/>Two camps empanoplied. Then <persName>Rustam</persName> chose
<lb/>His battle-ground, whereat the world grew black
<lb/>With horse-raised dust. Ashkash and <persName>Gustaham</persName>
<lb/>Were on the right with many cavaliers,
<lb/>Upon the left were Zanga and <persName>Ruhham</persName>.
<lb/>All rose superior to that conflict. <persName>Rustam</persName>,
<lb/>The warriors' warden and the host’s support,
<lb/>Was at the centre with <persName>Bizhan</persName> the son
<lb/>Of <persName>Giv</persName>. Behind the host was <persName>Mount</persName> Bisttin,
<lb/>In front a citadel of scimitars.
<lb/><persName>Afrasiyab</persName>, when he beheld that host,
<lb/>With <persName>Rustam</persName> who was seen cominanding it,
<lb/>In dudgeon donned his armour for the battle,
<lb/>And bade his troops to halt. He drew them up
<lb/>In due array against the foe. The earth
<lb/>Was hidden and the air like indigo.
<lb/>The left wing he intrusted to <persName>Piran</persName>,
<lb/>While brave <persName>Human</persName> departed to the nght ;
<lb/>The centre he consigned to <persName>Garsiwaz</persName>

<lb/><q>No lion is affrighted at a plain
<lb/>OF onagers ; stars ape the sun in vain;
<lb/>The lusty mountain-sheep if it shall hear
<lb/>A wolf's claws named will shiver, heart and ear;
<lb/>No fox is daring, try he e'er so much,
<lb/>No onagers the lion’s claws will touch</q>?
<lb/>Be never king as light of wit as thou,
<lb/>Or he will give his kingdom to the winds.

<lb/><q>O warriors of <placeName>Turan</placeName>! are we engaged

<lb/>Ye must endure hard toil in this emprise,

<p><lb/>Steel sparths descended like a storm of hail
<lb/>Upon the coats of mail, the helms, and casques,
<lb/>While at the gleam of <persName>Rustam</persName>’s dragon-flag
<lb/>The bright sun’s face grew azure-dim ; he veiled

<lb/><q>The sun with pitch.</q> Where'er he urged on <rs type="horse">Rakhsh</rs>
<lb/>He trampled on the heads of cavaliers.
<lb/>Grasped in his hand he bore an ox-head mace,
<lb/>And seemed a dromedary broken loose.
<lb/>He came forth from the centre like a wolf,
<lb/>And scattered all the foemen’s vast array.
<lb/>Then horsemen’s heads were shed as leaves are shed
<lb/>Before the blast, and fortune left the <rs type="ethnic">Turkmans</rs>.
<lb/>Swift as the wind Ashkash upon the right

<lb/>Whenas <persName>Gudarz</persName> and <persName>Giv</persName> received the news

<lb/>Went up, troops mustered, and the tymbal-players

<lb/>Through whom we have recovered our lost son.
<lb/>Thou hast delivered us from pain and grief,
<lb/>And made us all thy servants in <placeName>Iran</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The chiefs remounted and approached in pomp
<lb/>The palace of the monarch of the world,

<lb/>Drew near the city of the king of kings,
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> himself,—the warden of the troops

<lb/>When <persName>Rustam</persName> by the pomp knew that the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>

<lb/>A vase of royal gems, a hundred steeds
<lb/>All saddled and a hundred laden camels,
<lb/>A hundred fair-faced hanamaids ready girt,
<lb/>A hundred slaves adorned with torques of gold,
<lb/>Were brought before the master of the world,
<lb/>Who gave them all to <persName>Rustam</persName> of <placeName>Zabul</placeName>.
<lb/>That hero kissed the ground and then stood upright.
<lb/>He set upon his head that royal crown,
<lb/>He bound that royal girdle round his loins,
<lb/>Did homage to the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, then left the presence,
<lb/>And made his preparations for <placeName>Sistan</placeName>.
<lb/>Next to the nobles that had been with <persName>Rustam</persName>
<lb/>In toil and fight, in happiness and sorrow,
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> gave gifts, to each in his degree:
<lb/>They left the palace of <persName>Khusrau</persName>, rejoicing.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs>, when he had finished with the chiefs,
<lb/>And sat at leisure on his throne, commanded
<lb/><persName>Bizhan</persName> to come, and spake of all his troubles,
<lb/>While for his part <persName>Bizhan</persName> informed the <rs type="role">Shah</rs>
<lb/>At large of that strait dungeon, of his conflicts,
<lb/>And what had happened in those evil days.
<lb/>The <rs type="role">Shah</rs> forgave him and much pitied too
<lb/>The pains and sorrows of the luckless damsel,
<milestone unit="vullers" n="1139"/>
<lb/>Called for a hundred garments of brocade
<lb/>Of <placeName>Rum</placeName>, gem-patterned on a ground of gold,
<lb/>A crown, ten purses also of dinars,
<lb/>Girl-slaves and carpets and all kinds of wealth,
<lb/>And said thus to <persName>Bizhan</persName>: <q> These precious things
<lb/>Bear to the lady of the mournful soul,
<lb/>Use her not hardly, speak no chilling word,
<lb/>Consider all that thou hast brought on her.
<lb/>Go through this world rejoicing by her side,
<pb n="357"/>
<lb/>And take thou heed of time’s vicissitudes,
<lb/>How it will raise one to the heights of heaven,
<lb/>And bear him all unharmed by care and anguish,
<lb/>Then how that heaven will fling him to the dust,
<lb/>Where all is fear, anxiety, and dread!
<lb/>The man whom fortune cherished on its breast
<lb/>It casteth wantonly to depths of need,
<lb/>And raiseth thence another to the throne,
<lb/>And setteth on his head a jewelled crown !
<lb/>The world is not ashamed of such ill doings,
<lb/>For it respecteth no one; and, although
<lb/>For ever dominating good and bad,
<lb/>Ensueth not the peace of any one.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Such is the manner of our earthly lot!
<lb/>It leadeth us alike to good and ill,
<lb/>And noble hearts may live untroubled still
<lb/>So long as poverty oppresseth not.
<lb/>The story of <persName>Gudarz</persName> I next unfold
<lb/>And of <persName>Piran</persName>; that of <persName>Bizhan</persName> is told
<lb/>As I have heard it in the tales of old.
